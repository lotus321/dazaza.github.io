"note_en": "Due to inevitable pedanticism, &#34;Linux&#34; in this article refers to a standard Linux or GNU/Linux distro.\n    There is a common assumption that Linux is a very secure operating system. This is very far from the truth for various different reasons.     There is no strong sandboxing in the standard desktop. This means all applications have access to each other\u2019s data and can snoop on your personal information. Most programs are written in memory unsafe languages such as C or C++ which has been the cause of  the majority of discovered security vulnerabilities and modern exploit mitigations such as Control-Flow Integrity are not widely used.     The kernel is also very lacking in security. It is a monolithic kernel written entirely in a memory unsafe language and has hundreds of bugs, many being security vulnerabilities,  found each  month. In fact, there are so many bugs being found in the kernel, developers can\u2019t keep up which results in many of the bugs  staying unfixed for a long time. The kernel is also  decades behind in exploit mitigations and many kernel developers simply  do not care enough.     On ordinary desktops, a compromised non-root user account with access to  sudo is almost equal to full root compromise as there are too many ways for an attacker to retrieve the sudo password. Usually, the standard user is part of group  sudo which makes this a massive issue and makes a sudo password almost security theater. For example, the attacker can exploit the plethora of keylogging opportunities such as  X\u2019s lack of GUI isolation, the  many infoleaks in  /proc, use   LD_PRELOAD to hook into every process and so much more. Even if we mitigate every single way to log keystrokes, the attacker can just setup their own fake sudo program to grab the user password.     This is all it takes to get your  sudo password:  cat &lt;&lt;\\EOF &gt; /tmp/sudo#!/bin/bashif [[ &#34;${@}&#34; = &#34;&#34; ]]; then /usr/bin/sudoelse read -s -r -p &#34;[sudo] password for ${USER}: &#34; password echo &#34;${password}&#34; &gt; /tmp/password echo -e &#34;\\nSorry, try again.&#34; /usr/bin/sudo ${@}fiEOFchmod +x /tmp/sudoexport PATH=&#34;/tmp:${PATH}&#34;\n   Now the attacker is just a  modprobe away from full kernel access.\n    Standard system hardening is not enough to fix any of these massive architectural security issues. Restricting a few minor things is not going to fix this. Likewise, a few common security features distros deploy by default is also not going to fix this. Just because your distro enables a MAC framework without creating a strict policy and still running most processes unconfined, doesn&#39;t mean you can escape from these.     The hardening required for a reasonably secure Linux distro is far greater than people assume. You will need full system MAC policies, full verified boot (not just the boot chain, the entire base system), a strong sandboxing architecture, a hardened kernel, widespread use of modern exploit mitigations and plenty more.     One Linux distro that actually is working on fixing these issues is  Whonix.\n    Flatpak aims to sandbox applications but its sandboxing is very flawed. It fully trusts the applications and allows them to specify their own policy. This means security is optional and apps can just choose not to be sufficiently sandboxed.     Flatpak&#39;s permissions are also far too broad to be meaningful. For example, many applications come with  filesystem=home which is read-write access to the user&#39;s home directory, giving access to all of your personal files and allowing trivial escapes via writing to  ~/.bashrc or similar.     Another example of Flatpak&#39;s broad permissions is how it allows unfiltered access to the X11 socket, allowing easy escapes due to X11&#39;s lack of GUI isolation. Adding X11 sandboxing via a nested X11 server such as Xpra is easy but Flatpak developers refuse to acknowledge this and continue to claim  &#34;X11 is impossible to secure&#34;.     Even more examples of this is how Flatpak gives full access to directories such as  /sys or  /proc (kernel interfaces known for information leaks).", "posttime": "2020-05-12 11:55:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "linux,sudo", "title": "Linux(In)\u5b89\u5168\u6027", "title_en": "Linux (In)Security", "transed": 1, "url": "https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "sudo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8d8751343044ace6463bc2b9e82906ac.jpg", "infoid": 1001761, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "(CNN)\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u662f\u672a\u6765\u3002\u5982\u679c\u201c\u897f\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u201d\u6216\u201c\u9ed1\u955c\u201d\u662f\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7edf\u6cbb\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u7684\u90a3\u4e00\u5929\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u4f1a\u5230\u6765\u3002\n\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e13\u5229\u5546\u6807\u5c40\u5426\u8ba4\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edfDABUS\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u4e24\u9879\u4e13\u5229\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u88c1\u51b3\uff0c\u79f0\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u4e13\u5229\u53ea\u80fd\u6388\u4e88\u81ea\u7136\u4eba\u3002\n\u8fd9\u4e24\u9879\u4e13\u5229\u5206\u522b\u662f\u98df\u54c1\u5bb9\u5668\u548c\u624b\u7535\u7b52\uff0c\u7531\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u3001DABUS&39\uff1b\u521b\u5efa\u8005\u65af\u8482\u82ac\u00b7\u6cf0\u52d2(Stephen Thaler)\u7533\u8bf7\u3002\u6839\u636e\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e13\u5229\u5546\u6807\u5c40\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u6cf0\u52d2\u79f0DABUS\u662f\u4e00\u53f0\u521b\u610f\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5e0c\u671b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u5f52\u529f\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u660e\u3002\u6587\u4ef6\u79f0\uff0c\u6cf0\u52d2\u8fa9\u79f0\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e00\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u88ab\u5217\u4e3a\u53d1\u660e\u5bb6\u5c06\u6fc0\u52b1\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u3002CNN\u5df2\u8054\u7cfb\u6cf0\u52d2\u8bf7\u5176\u7f6e\u8bc4\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6839\u636eUSPTO\u7684\u88c1\u51b3\uff0c\u53d1\u660e\u53ea\u80fd\u7531\u81ea\u7136\u4eba\u63d0\u4ea4(\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u54f2\u5b66\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6765\u6784\u601d)\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u53cd\u6620\u5728\u4e13\u5229\u6cd5\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u6cd5\u9662\u88c1\u51b3\u4e2d\u3002\n\u8bf4\u5230\u54f2\u5b66\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u88c1\u51b3\u5f15\u7528\u4e861994\u5e74\u8054\u90a6\u5de1\u56de\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u88c1\u51b3\uff0c\u8be5\u88c1\u51b3\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u53d1\u660e\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u80af\u5b9a\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4f60\u7684\u5927\u8111\u9677\u5165\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u7701\u7684\u8ff7\u5bab\u3002\n\u6784\u601d\u662f\u53d1\u660e\u529b\u7684\u8bd5\u91d1\u77f3\uff0c\u662f\u5b8c\u6210\u53d1\u660e\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u53d1\u660e\u8005\u5934\u8111\u4e2d\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5173\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53d1\u660e\u7684\u660e\u786e\u7684\u3001\u6c38\u4e45\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u2026\u2026\u3002[\u6784\u601d]\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5fc3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a.&#34\uff1b\n\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u548c\u82f1\u56fd\uff0c\u5c06DABUS\u5217\u4e3a\u53d1\u660e\u8005\u7684\u4e13\u5229\u4e5f\u56e0\u4e0e\u4eba\u683c\u6709\u5173\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u539f\u56e0\u800c\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\u3002\u6b27\u6d32\u4e13\u5229\u5c40\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7a76\u7adf\u7531\u8c01\u6765\u884c\u4f7f\u6388\u4e88\u53d1\u660e\u4eba\u7684\u6743\u5229\u3002\nThaler\u662fDABUS\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5934\u8111\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\uff0c\u4e5f\u662fImagination Engines\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002DABUS\u5c31\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u60f3\u8c61\u529b\u5f15\u64ce\u5c06DABUS\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u53d1\u660e\u5bb6\uff0c\u5b83\u88ab\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e3a\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u795e\u79d8\u7684\u3001\u539f\u59cb\u7684\u53d1\u660e\u706b\u82b1\u3002", "note_en": "(CNN)Artificial intelligence is the future. If &#34;Westworld&#34; or &#34;Black Mirror&#34; are to be believed, there will soon come a day when the computers rule us all.\n  The USPTO  has denied a pair of patents filed on behalf of DABUS, an artificial intelligence system, and published a ruling that says US patents can only be granted to &#34;natural persons.&#34;\n   The two patents were for a food container and a flashlight, and  were filed by Stephen Thaler, an AI researcher and DABUS&#39; creator. According to the filing from the USPTO, Thaler calls DABUS a &#34;creativity machine&#34; and wanted the AI to get full credit for the inventions. The filing says Thaler argued that &#34;allowing a machine to be listed as an inventor would incentivize innovation using AI systems.&#34; CNN has reached out to Thaler for comment.\n    However, according to the USPTO&#39;s ruling, inventions can only be submitted (and depending on how philosophical you want to get, conceived) by a &#34;natural person,&#34; as reflected in the language of patent law and also in previous federal court rulings.\n Speaking of philosophy, the ruling quotes a Federal Circuit court decision from 1994 that expounds on the nature of invention in a way that&#39;s certain to send your brain down the maze of reflexive self-awareness.\n &#34;Conception is the touchstone of inventorship, the completion of the mental part of invention. It is the formation in the mind of the inventor, of a definite and permanent idea of the complete and operative invention ... [Conception] is a mental act ...&#34;\n Patents that list DABUS as the inventor  have also been denied in Europe and the UK for similar reasons related to personhood. The European Patent Office also raised the issue of who, exactly, would enforce the rights granted to an inventor under such a circumstance.\n   Thaler, the mind behind DABUS, is a physicist and founder of Imagination Engines, a company that researches and develops artificial neural networks.  DABUS is one such artificial neural network. Imagination Engines describes DABUS as a &#34;true artificial inventor&#34; that is programmed to mimic the neural patterns of human thought that lead to the mysterious, primal spark of invention.",

"note_en": "The world has never seen anything quite like Aarogya Setu. Two months ago, India\u2019s app for coronavirus contact tracing didn\u2019t exist; now it has nearly 100 million users. Prime Minister Narendra Modi boosted it on release by urging every one of the country\u2019s 1.3 billion people to download it, and the result was that within two weeks of launch it became the fastest app ever to reach 50 million downloads.\n  \u201cWe beat Pok\u00e9mon Go,\u201d says a smiling Arnab Kumar, who is leading development of the service for the Indian government.\n  But although the app\u2019s growth is unprecedented, it is extraordinary in an even more important way: if you don\u2019t install it, you might lose your job, get fined, or go to jail.\n  India is currently the only democratic nation in the world that is making its coronavirus tracking app mandatory for millions of people,   according to MIT Technology Review\u2019s Covid Tracing Tracker, a database of global contact tracing apps.\n  While official policy is that downloading the app is voluntary, the truth is that government employees are  required to use it, while major private employers and landlords are  mandating it as well. The city of Noida is now  reportedly fining and even threatening to arrest anyone who fails to install the app on their phone.\n  It\u2019s a dramatic step generating fierce criticism from civil liberties experts nationally, and from all over the globe.\n  Rahul Gandhi, a prominent member of the Indian parliament and former leader of the opposition Indian National Congress, is among those who have criticized the app, charging that it has \u201cno institutional oversight\u201d and raises \u201cserious data security and privacy concerns.\u201d\n  \u201cTechnology can help keep us safe,\u201d Gandhi recently tweeted. \u201cBut fear must not be leveraged to track citizens without their consent.\u201d\n  \u201cThere is an infringement on human rights that is not justified here,\u201d says Estelle Mass\u00e9, a senior policy analyst at the digital rights group Access Now. \u201cThere is a risk of initiating a tool that can be repurposed for surveillance after the pandemic.\u201d\n    MIT Technology Review\u2019s database shows that India\u2019s app is unique in a number of other ways, too. Many countries are developing limited services that use Bluetooth or GPS to give \u201cexposure notifications\u201d to people who have interacted with someone found to have covid-19. India\u2019s app, though, is a massive all-in-one undertaking that far exceeds what most other countries are building. It tracks Bluetooth contact events and location\u2014as many other apps do\u2014but also gives each user a color-coded badge showing infection risk. And on top of this, Aarogya Setu (which means \u201ca bridge to health\u201d in Hindi) also offers access to telemedicine, an e-pharmacy, and diagnostic services. It\u2019s whitelisted by all Indian telecom companies, so using it does not count against mobile data limits.\n  What the app lacks also sets it apart. India has no national data privacy law, and it\u2019s not clear who has access to data from the app and in what situations. There are no strong, transparent policy or design limitations on accessing or using the data at this point. The list of developers, largely made up of private-sector volunteers, is not entirely public.\n  Kumar stresses that the app was built to the standards of a draft data privacy bill that is currently in the country\u2019s parliament, and says access to the data it collects is strictly controlled. But critics have expressed concern because it is not open source, despite an Indian government mandate that its apps make their code available to the public. Kumar says that this is a goal for Aarogya Setu and will happen down the line, but he could not confirm a timeline or expected date.\n  When Aarogya Setu was first announced, the Indian government did seek consent, and using the app initially sounded voluntary. Today, at least 1 million people have been given orders to use it, including central government workers and employees of private companies like the food delivery services Zomato and Swiggy. It\u2019s a well-practiced tactic in India, where \u201cvoluntary mandatory\u201d technology has a history of being used as a gatekeeper to certain important rights.\n  While India is the only democracy to make its contact tracing app mandatory for millions of people, other democracies have struck deals with mobile phone companies to access location data from residents. In Europe, the data has largely been aggregated and anonymized. In Israel, law enforcement focused on the pandemic has used a phone tracking database normally reserved for counterterrorism purposes. The Israeli government\u2019s tactics have been the subject of a legal battle that made its way up to the country\u2019s Supreme Court and legislature.\n    Many of these difficulties can be traced to a lack of transparency. Neither the privacy policy nor the terms of service for the app were publicly accessible at the time of publication, and the developers have not shared them despite requests. Since the app is not open source, its code and methods can\u2019t easily be reviewed by third parties, and there is no public sunset clause stating when the app will cease to be mandatory, although Kumar says data is deleted on a rolling basis after, at most, 60 days for sick individuals and 30 days for healthy people. And there is no clear road map for how far India\u2019s national and state governments will go: one recent  report said the government wants Aarogya Setu preinstalled on all new smartphones; another said the app may soon be  required to travel.\n  In the early days of the app\u2019s development, Kumar said it would leverage the technology being jointly developed by Apple and Google for iPhone and Android. That system will be released in just a few days,  but it now comes with rules that include requiring user consent and banning location tracking\u2014neither of which Aarogya Setu complies with. Kumar says Google engineers have been in close contact with Aarogya Setu\u2019s developers, and his team will evaluate whether they can still implement the decentralized Silicon Valley system, which is intended to preserve privacy. Google and Apple have fast-tracked the app into both the Android and iOS app stores.\n  But there are still deep concerns that blurring the line between voluntary and mandatory, and between privacy-preserving and privacy-invading, will have long-term consequences.\n  \u201cThere is no effort made by the state to earn citizen trust,\u201d says Anivar Aravind, executive director at the civic-technology organization Indic Project. \u201cHere are a set of private-sector corporate volunteers, with no accountability, that built an app for governments that is forced to personal devices of everyone.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-12 11:54:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7a0b\u5e8f,app,forcing", "title":

So we&#39;re going to have to really rethink how businesses operate. They need their employees back.&#34;\n Schmidt, who led Google from 2001 to 2011, said the density of global megacities would change as employees at the same firm work in different locations.\n &#34;If you think of it as an employer, you have a bunch of employees, some of whom are dying to get back to the office and some people who are afraid that if they go to the office they will die,&#34; he said.\n &#34;They&#39;re very concerned about they&#39;re immunocompromised or what have you. So they&#39;re going to have to come up with flexible arrangements. So imagine that there are three or four people: one will go to the office, one will stay home, some will go to some local or near-their-town working environment. It will change the pattern.\n   &#34;We&#39;ve had this situation where people move to supercities in these incredibly concentrated ways. That will change in the next few years. You don&#39;t need to be in the supercity in order to participate in the excitement of these supercities.&#34;\n CNET reported on Saturday that Schmidt, who&#39;s been an adviser to Google since 2011, had stepped down from that position in February. The former exec remains one of the wealthiest people in the world, with a net worth of $15.5 billion,  according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.", "posttime": "2020-05-12 11:53:32",

"note_en": "If you take out  The Office\u2019s physical interactions between characters  and try to tell the same jokes over Slack, does  The Office still work?\n It\u2019s a question that creative collective MSCHF set to find out, recreating all 201 episodes of the series over Slack. Viewers will  join a live Slack, where different channels are dedicated to various departments, including accounting, warehouse, and a general office room. Viewers are requested to avoid posting in the \u201ccompany\u201d channels, but are encouraged to pop in and out of channels to keep up with the episodes as they don\u2019t all play in one. Since it is a live Slack, inappropriate messages and images do pop up, but the MSCHF team has a number of moderators working to keep it as troll-free as possible, a representative told  The Verge.\n Some jokes are easier to translate than others; one  example used is \u201cThe Injury\u201d from the show\u2019s second season. After burning his foot on a George Foreman grill that he keeps at the foot of his bed, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) calls into the office to try to get some help. The conversation takes place over the phone in the episode, but the MSCHF team used Slack to recreate it, involving all the characters from the original sketch.\n   \u201cSince  The Office aired, the nature of work and office culture has changed drastically, a lot of which is centered around the way we use technologies,\u201d Daniel Greenberg, head of strategy at MSCHF, told  The Verge. \u201cThis is a live experience by real people Mondays through Fridays, nine-to-five.\u201d\n MSCHF started working on the project before the pandemic hit, but it\u2019s never felt so timely. Slack, like teleconferencing tool Zoom, is seeing a massive uptick in usage as people move to work from home. CEO Stewart Butterfield shared numbers in a lengthy tweet thread a few weeks back; on March 10th, Slack\u2019s concurrent users passed 10 million. It would jump by 2.5 million users by March 25th.\n \u201cWe have an incredible business that has been growing very quickly and that will continue to do so for many, many years to come,\u201d Butterfield told Slack employees, as seen in  screenshots he tweeted. \u201cWe provide a platform that is going to become even more useful to the world in the years to come.\u201d\n   It\u2019s fun to imagine  The Office as a Slack-based workplace comedy. Even Ben Silverman and Paul Lieberstein, co-producers on  The Office,  are working on a new series (another workplace comedy) that takes place entirely over computer screens. Visual gags go from slapstick comedy to GIFs and italicized \u201cOK Michael\u201d responses in public rooms. Although the script hasn\u2019t changed in the adaptation process, Greenberg told  The Verge the teams did figure out ways to make the jokes work on Slack by finding GIFs and other features within the service to translate the comedy.\n It could take roughly two to three weeks for each episode to \u201cair\u201d over Slack, so settle in.", "posttime": "2020-05-12 11:40:02", "source_domain":

"note_en": "I gathered a selection of my photographs and wrote what follows with this goal in mind: to make you feel the same fascination for an amazing place, Druid Heights, that I did after my visit there on November 16, 2016. For all of you, and especialy those viewing on your phone, there are 70 photos coming up mixed in with my decriptive text, once you (hopefully!) read through the intro. Enjoy! To learn more about this special place and its history go to the Save Druid Heights Facebook group page\n 8/29/18 Update: I have put several briefer stories about Druid Heights online since this first one. This is the most complete view. The others can be found by searching Medium using Druid Heights or my name, Michael Toivonen , as your search term.\n This is how it began for me: One day in early 2016, by mere chance, I recalled a long forgotten name, Druid Heights. It had been 40 years since I first heard it while at high school in nearby Mill Valley, California in the 1970\u2019s. Beyond the name all I knew at that time was that a writer on eastern religion that I had been reading, Alan Watts, was living there when he died and that a woman named Elsa Gidlow who was, maybe, a poet, still lived there. I had been intrigued but I had never learned more.\n When that unusual place name popped into my head one rainy day 40 years later I had my laptop ready to launch a query. I found some newspaper articles and some images. It seemed there was quite a bit more to Druid Heights than what I had vaguely imagined\u2026.\n By the time of my visit there I had learned that the two principle founders, Elsa Gidlow and Roger Somers, were both creative and productive people whose magnetic personalities were of very different yet quite complimentary sorts, especially in their mutual ability to attract a broad range of significant cultural figures to Druid Heights. Even though Druid Heights physically covers a relatively small area, the two principle founders personality differences meant that there were simultaneously two very different social circles operating there, which served to increase its significance.\n Yorkshire, UK born and Quebec, Canada raised Elsa GIdlow\u2019s (1898\u20131986) formal education had ended when she was a teenager. But by 1954 when she wrote the check for the down payment on 5 acres and some buildings outside Mill Valley, CA. her natural gifts, hard working habits and audacity had taken her far.\n She earned earned her living as a journalist and had expressed herself through poetry, most notably her 1923 volume \u201cOn a Grey Thread\u201d, the first openly lesbian poetry published by an American writer. She had lived in New York and Paris during the early roaring \u201920s and had established herself in San Francisco by the end of that decade. And by the end of her life her autobiography, \u201cElsa: I Come with My Songs\u201d became the first full length autobiography of an American lesbian.\n In California she had become friends with many of the most significant writers and artists of the time. Soon after she moved into her new home at the place she came to call Druid Heights many of those friends, and new ones from near and far, became frequent visitors.\n Roger Somers\u2019 (1926\u20132001) was a visionary builder and craftsman who worked hard and partied just as hard or harder. A gifted amateur musician, his portion of Druid Heights soon became a mecca for the many professional musicians whom he befriended. These were not just local night club players, they were nationally and internationally known musicians whose names are still household words today. Roger also had many friends who were artists and writers and they too came to visit, and to party.\n Roger Somers was responsible for the design and construction of the most distinctive buildings at Druid Heights and the alteration of some of the prior owner\u2019s into buildings so different as to be in some cases nearly unrecognizable. His abilities as a builder attracted the younger Ed Stiles to Druid Heights in 1965. Over the years Ed, a talented furniture maker and builder, also made a number of significant contributions to the architecture at Druid Heights. As a person who has done a bit of building and woodworking myself it was the work of Roger and Ed at Druid Heights that, once I learned of it, was initially the strongest draw.\n A few months after taking an interest in Druid Heights I contacted an old friend from my high school days who I thought, correctly, might know how to get there. On a sunny weekday morning in the fall I took a hike and arrived at Druid Heights. I spent a few hours there examining the unoccupied buildings as best I could, and luckily I took a lot of photographs. While, to my surprise, I found that the empty buildings weren\u2019t locked some were in such bad shape that entering them did not seem safe. Still, I found more than enough to look at and photograph.\n Besides the buildings in bad shape part of Druid Heights was and is still inhabited by people who have life leases on the homes and land they once owned. Their areas are posted with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs and I stayed away from them.\n On a return visit 3 months later I planned to take more photographs. But what I had hoped to do was no longer possible because all the unoccupied buildings were now posted with \u201cDanger: Do Not Enter\u201d signs by the National Park Service, the government agency that owns all of Druid Heights.\n In the months following my initial visit I continued trying to learn as much about Druid Heights as I could. And the more I learned the more I came to feel that Druid Heights should be preserved as a unique national historic site. The distinctive buildings of Druid Heights had sheltered so many writers, artists, musicians and spiritual thinkers from the mid 1950s on. Having visited many historic sites over my life I came to believe that the Druid Heights site and story was quite worthy of joining their ranks, and that if it was lost, the loss would be tragic.\n Since all the buildings are now off limits I decided to share a glimpse of what I found using the photos I took that fall day, along with some explanatory text. I know a lot more about the history now, over a year later, but I am going to keep the descriptions brief and let the pictures do the talking. I hope that after looking at what I saw on that visit you too are left with the feeling that Druid Heights is a historic site worth saving!\n Below is a rough map of the 6 acre Druid Heights site that I was sent after I and others formed the Save Druid Heights group in the summer of 2017. It will help you understand the general layout. The original had some clues to the location of Druid Heights and they have been blacked out.\n The Save Druid Heights group that I am a co-founder of does not support unauthorised visits to Druid Heights and we won\u2019t give out directions. At this time going there works against, not for preservation. Become a supporter of preservation, and join the Save Druid Heights Facebook group to learn more and keep up to date on efforts to save this unique place.\n  The date of my visit to Druid Heights was November 16, 2016. By chance I picked a significant date in Druid Heights history to arrive: the 43rd anniversary of the death of Alan Watts (1915\u20131973).\n I had no map then and didn\u2019t know much about the layout. I had been told that there were areas that were still inhabited and that I should avoid those. On arriving on foot I met two others, a man and woman, who were there to perform a ritual meditation in Alan\u2019s Library on the anniversary of his passing. I had originally intended to go there first but on learning of their plans I decided to make it my last stop. I told the them of intentions and they thanked me.\n They said I should head on up the road and be sure not to miss what they called \u201cThe Dragon House\u201d, which I later learned was also known to others, including the man most responsible for how it looks today, the late Roger Somers, as the Twin peaks House. On the map above it is called the Ranch House since it was the original building from the property\u2019s early days as a small homestead or farm.\n Leaving the area of the library I headed towards where I thought I would find the house of Druid Heights co-founder Elsa Gidlow. I had been told that the Dragon House was just beyond it.\n  I walked up the dirt road and the drive to Elsa\u2019s appeared on my left. Because of it\u2019s steepness the driveway was paved, the only place where I saw asphalt in Druid Heights.\n As I came to the top of the drive I saw this small building on my right. On the map this appears as a small red square near the red rectangle of the Gidlow House. In government reports on Druid Heights it is called the meditation hut but I have been told that it was also called the Goddess cabin. As alluded to above, more than one name is the case with several of the buildings at Druid Heights.\n  I had never seen shingle edges cut into a pattern like this before, so I had to take a closer look\n  Walking around to the other side I found this beautiful faceted window with a straight through to the other side view.\n  Leaving the Meditation hut I headed towards a small house ahead on my left. It was hard to really get a sense of it at first because of all the shrubbery and trees surrounding it. I was pretty sure that it had to be Elsa Gidlow\u2019s house.\n It was obviously older than what I could see of the library that I had viewed through the bushes earlier as well as the meditation hut. I later learned that is was built in 1943 for the one of the daughters of the prior owners of the property, Alfons and Selma Haapa. It is only around 800 square feet, so many might call it a cottage, not a house. But while small in size and simple in design it appeared to be well built and on a full concrete perimeter foundation.\n  Next I headed west towards the likely rotten beyond repair deck on the that side. Hidden beneath the leaves and weeds near it is a concrete patio.\n  At the other end of the house there was evidence of a very close call: a tree had fallen and just missed it by a couple of feet.\n  To the left of where the tree had just missed the Gidlow house was a large picture window looking into a bedroom. Here I was greeted with my first view of the very conventional interior.\n  Now I headed towards the front door of the house. I have to say I was rather shocked to find it unlocked. That being the case, and there then being no signs against doing so, I went in.\n  Once inside I turned to the left and found myself in the kitchen. The sink appeared to be part of an old one piece prefabricated unit. Behind me when I took this photo were some cabinets that I later learned Roger had built soon after Elsa moved in.\n  The living room was very fairly spacious for such a small house. The fireplace was well crafted, and looked to be from when the house was built in 1943. The now empty book shelves on the left appeared to be a somewhat later addition which I later learned was the case. Like the kitchen cabinets Roger had built them to house Elsa\u2019s collection of books soon after she moved in. The day I of my visit there were a couple of books on the built-in sofa but they looked to have been left by recent visitors.\n  Now it was time to find the \u201cDragon House\u201d as the people at the library had called it, or the Ranch House as it is called on the map. Walking through brush growing between trees I saw the profile of a very unusual roof towering above me up ahead.\n  As I got closer I saw a rather strange window. The glass was square but immediately behind it was what appeared to be a wall with a large circular opening. Jutting out from the sides of the circular opening were thin boards that seemed to form a couple of shelves.\n   Walking along the west side of the Twin Peaks, Dragon or Ranch house (take your pick!) looking for an entry I found myself on a masonry path with some very unusual designs in it.\n  If you look on the left side of the sadly decaying deck you can make out the pathway shown in the previous photo. I learned later that the lower \u201cspears\u201d seen here supported a wisteria vine until a few years ago. If you enlarge the photo the chains running back to the wall that help support them become visible. Luckily this house has a fairly wide roof overhang, a feature which really helps preserve a building from water damage as long as the roof is intact.\n  Since Elsa Gidlow\u2019s house had been open it seemed possible the Twin Peaks would be too. Before checking that out I walked away towards the east to get a better look at it. That hadn\u2019t been possible from the other side because of all the brush. Besides getting a better view of the distinctive roof line, I noticed a very unusual pattern made by using different colors of asphalt shingles on the roof. I have looked at many an unusual house over my 59 years both in person, in books and online but I don\u2019t recall ever seeing anything like the Twin Peaks house roof.\n  Here is a closeup. I am sure glad I had just bought a decent new Nikon point and shoot camera! I do not conside myself much of a photographer but it helped make up for my short comings.\n  Now I went back towards the Twin Peaks House. It was obvious that I should not try to approach the doors that appeared to go into what was likely the living room because I would need to walk over the rotten deck to do so. It looked like there were other doors long the east side. To get to them I found myslf walking on another stretch of very unusual path way.\n  Now on my left was an unusual window and it looked like the kitchen was inside. It was unusual because where was the support for the roof? Shouldn\u2019t there be a post at the corner? How the roof is supported there is still a mystery\u2026\n  Walking further down the path I was moving towards what you see above. I have to say that by this point my lower jaw felt like it was hanging pretty low\u2026..what a place, and I hadn&#39;t even gone in!\n I wasn\u2019t sure what I was seeing ahead of me, but it did appear that on the right was a partly open door with a recessed yellow panel shaped like a guitar. On the way towards it the opening seen to the left appeared to have been into a storage area, but given the attention to detail it must not have been for ordinary objects\u2026\u2026I headed past it and fully opened the door.\n  This is the view that greeted me. I had entered the bathroom room and was getting my first glimpse of some of Druid Heights co-founder Roger Somers\u2019 signature interior cabinetry. Note that the middle alcove has a pivoting mirror. I later learned from his son Tagore that the majority of the remodel of the Twin Peaks house was completed by around 1962.\n  If you wondered why it was so bright inside here is the answer: a very large skylight.\n  As I went further in I found the sink and toilet and more built in storage.\n   Medium.com does not seem to be able to handle vertical aspect photos. Or at least I could not make them work. In most cases cropping them close to square is no problem. But here it doesn\u2019t work because too much would be lost, so I split it in half. I took this photo with the sink and toilet in the previous image on my right looking back towards the door I came in through also on the right at the far end of the room. Don\u2019t miss the tiled shower at the far end, the recessed ceiling light panels and then the boards on the floor in the foreground of the lower of the two images.\n  Looking down at the two boards on the floor I saw hinges. Quite curious, I reached down and lifting the edge. Under the boards I found another surprising feature of the Twin Peaks house bathroom: an old fashioned tub set into the floor.\n  I should have used the flash on this one but didn\u2019t realize that until too late, meaning back home. The toilet is just is on the left, the drawers visible in the photo above showing the toilet and sink are on the right and we are looking into the kitchen. Notice how the pattern in the slate floor is much like that outside in the pathway. More than half the floors in the Twin Peaks house are slate.\n  Moving forward I found myself on the other side of that kitchen window. The ceiling looks low, and it is. It is higher over the center between the counters. The ceiling appears to be full of hidden light fixtures behind fiberglass panels. I was later told that it is.\n   I was ready to leave the kitchen, and I turned to look through an opening with a recessed sliding door towards what looked like the living room with a woodstove in the corner.\n  Leaving the kitchen and turning to my right I was greeted with this view from the middle of the room. I was to later learn that Beat Generation poet Gary Snyder helped Roger in the late \u201950s on the remodel of the simple 1926 Haapa \u201cRanch house\u201d into what you see here and then lived in it for over a year in the late \u201960s. And that is just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d of history that went down in this house. The sliding doors beyond the sunken table can close it off from the room beyond. Take a close look on the right and you will see a very narrow hall way heading off to a small back room. I did not, unfortunately, take photos of that room. The room was pretty plain, but the hall leading to it was not\u2026..\n  Meanwhile, I turned around to my left. Remember the woodstove we saw from the kitchen? Just to the left of it the harp-like sound board of a piano is mounted in the wall. It can be strummed or plucked. Or made to resonate by throwing gravel at it which Roger Somers\u2019 son Tagore says his father did a few times in the midst of parties to get people\u2019s attention.\n  Here is that hallway. I had to clip this shot to make it fit, and I had to lie on the floor to take it. On the right is a hand painted mural show casing the Eucalyptus of Druid Heights and on the ceiling are more of Roger\u2019s custom recessed lights.\n  After checking out that narrow hall and the room at its end I went back into the living room and through the open shoji doors into a room completely paneled with shoji. To make them more durable Roger used fiberglass panels instead of rice paper. Now I was getting a good look at the round window I had seen earlier from outside.\n  The woodwork around in and around this window is simple, but the effect is simply amazing.\n  Turning to my left after looking out the round window I saw that the wall shoji were slid aside revealing a closet in a dark corner. Something was inside there but I had not thought to bring a flashlight. I did have the camera flash so I took a photo and this is what it revealed. Remember all the recessed lights we have seen? And there are also many we haven\u2019t.\n I was later told that in the late \u201850s/early \u201960s you could not drive over to Home Depot, or in those days in Mill Valley Goodman\u2019s Building Supply, and buy a box of dimmer switches if that was the effect you wanted. Roger either built himself or had built this is custom control panel for all the Twin Peaks house lights.\n Now I was ready to leave the Twin Peaks House. Well actually I really wasn\u2019t but I felt that I should. The next several photos are taken in the open areas between the Twin Peaks or Ranch House and what is called Faye\u2019s House on the map above. I will add descriptions to the extent I can, but my knowledge was and still is very limited about what is in the next few images.\n  There are still surviving remnants of the landscaping, like these Iris-like flowers. Several plants were in bloom completely out of season, as if it were spring. I was later told that this is not uncommon in areas that experience a lot of summer fog. Fall comes, and after a little rain and with overall decreased cloud cover they think it is spring.\n      An old, probably 1990s, Audi sedan with 2005 stickers. I subsequently learned that the last time anyone lived in any of the now unoccupied buildings was around 2006. I guess this got abandoned\u2026..\n  Not far from the Audi sedan there is an area that looked to have once been a fenced in garden, I will guess for vegetables.\n......", "posttime": "2020-05-12

"note_en": "If you are following the tech news, you might have seen the announcement that ICANN  withheld consent for the change of control of the Public Interest Registry and that this had some implications for .org.\u00a0 However, unless you follow a lot of DNS inside baseball, it might not be that clear what all this means. This post is intended to give a high level overview of the background here and what happened with .org. In addition, Mozilla has been actively engaged in the public discussion on this topic; see  here for a good starting point.\n  As you\u2019ve probably noticed, Web sites have names like \u201cmozilla.org\u201d, \u201cgoogle.com\u201d, etc. These are called \u201cdomain names.\u201d The way this all works is that there are a number of \u201ctop-level domains\u201d (.org, .com, .io, \u2026) and then people can get names within those domains (i.e., that end in one of those). Top level domains (TLDs) come in two main flavors:\n Country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) which represent some country or region like .us (United States), .uk (United Kingdom, etc.)\n Generic top-level domains (gTLDs) which don\u2019t correspond to some country or region, such as .com, .org, etc.\n Back at the beginning of the Internet, there were five gTLDs which were intended to roughly reflect the type of entity registering the name:\n  It\u2019s important to remember that until the 90s, much of the Internet ran under an  Acceptable Use Policy which discouraged/forbid commercial use and so these distinctions were inherently somewhat fuzzy, but nevertheless people had the rough understanding that .org was for non-profits and the like and .com was for companies.\n During this period the actual name registrations were handled by a series of government contractors (first SRI and then Network Solutions) but the creation and assignment of the top-level domains was under the control of the  Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which in practice, mostly meant the decisions of its Director,  Jon Postel. However, as the Internet became bigger, this became increasingly untenable especially as IANA was run under a contract to the US government. Through a long and somewhat complicated series of events, in 1998 this responsibility was handed off to the  Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which administers the overall system, including setting the overall rules and determining which gTLDs will exist (which ccTLDs exist is determined by ISO 3166-1 country codes, as described in  RFC 1591). ICANN has created a pile of new gTLDs, such as .dev, .biz, and  .wtf (you may be wondering whether the world really needed .wtf, but there it is). As an aside, many of the newer names you see registered are not actually under gTLDs, but rather ccTLDs that happen to correspond to countries lucky enough to have cool sounding country codes. For instance,  .io is actually the British Indian Ocean\u2019s TLD and  .tv belongs to Tuvalu.\n One of the other things that ICANN does is determine who gets to  run each TLD. The way this all works is that ICANN determines who gets to be the  registry, i.e., who keeps the records of who has which name as well as some of the technical data needed to actually route name lookups. The actual work of registering domain names is done by a  registrar, who engages with the customer. Importantly, while registrars compete for business at some level (i.e., multiple people can sell you a domain in .com), there is only one registry for a given TLD and so they don\u2019t have any price competition within that TLD; if you want a .com domain, VeriSign gets to set the price floor. Moreover, ICANN doesn\u2019t really try to keep prices down; in fact, they recently removed the cap on the price of .org domains (bringing it in line with most other TLDs). One interesting fact about these contracts is that they are effectively perpetual: the contracts themselves are for quite long terms and registry agreements typically provide for automatic renewal except under cases of significant misbehavior by the registry. In other words, this is a more or less permanent claim on the revenues for a given TLD.\n The bottom line here is that this is all quite lucrative. For example, in FY19 VeriSign\u2019s revenue was over  $1.2 billion. ICANN itself makes money in two main ways. First, it takes a cut of the revenue from each domain registration and second it  auctions off the contracts for new gTLDs if more than one entity wants to register them. In the fiscal year ending in June 2018, ICANN made  $136 million in total revenues (it was $302 million the previous year due to a large amount of revenue from gTLD auctions).\n  This brings us to the story of ISOC and .org. Until 2003, VeriSign operated .com, .net, and .org, but ICANN and VeriSign agreed to give up running .org (while retaining the far more profitable .com). As stated in their  proposal:\n As a general matter, it will largely eliminate the vestiges of special or unique treatment of VeriSign based on its legacy activities before the formation of ICANN, and generally place VeriSign in the same relationship with ICANN as all other generic TLD registry operators. In addition, it will return the .org registry to its original purpose, separate the contract expiration dates for the .com and .net registries, and generally commit VeriSign to paying its fair share of the costs of ICANN without any artificial or special limits on that responsibility.\n The  Internet Society (ISOC) is a nonprofit organization with the mission to support and promote \u201cthe development of the Internet as a global technical infrastructure, a resource to enrich people\u2019s lives, and a force for good in society\u201d. In 2002, they submitted one of  11 proposals to take over as the registry for .org and ICANN ultimately selected them. ICANN had a list of  11 criteria for the selection and the board  minutes are pretty vague on the reason for selecting ISOC, but at the time this was widely understood as ICANN using the .org contract to provide a subsidy for ISOC and ISOC\u2019s work. In any case, it ended up being quite a large subsidy: in 2018, PIR\u2019s revenue from .org was over  $92 million.\n The actual mechanics here are somewhat complicated: it\u2019s not like ISOC runs the registry itself. Instead they created a new non-profit subsidiary, the  Public Interest Registry (PIR), to hold the contract with ICANN to manage .org. PIR in turn contracts the actual operations to  Afilias, which is also the registry for a pile of other domains in their own right. [This isn\u2019t an uncommon structure. For instance, VeriSign is the registry for .com, but they also run .tv for Tuvalu.] This will become relevant to our story shortly. Additionally, in the summer of 2019, PIR\u2019s ten year agreement with ICANN renewed, but under new terms: looser contractual conditions to mirror those for the new gTLDs (yes, including .wtf), including the removal of a price cap and certain other provisions.\n  So, by 2018, ISOC was sitting on a pretty large ongoing revenue stream in the form of .org registration fees. However, ISOC management felt that having essentially all of their funding dependent on one revenue source was unwise and that actually running .org was a mismatch with ISOC\u2019s main mission. Instead, they entered into a deal to sell PIR (and hence the .org contract) to a private equity firm called  Ethos Capital, which is where things get interesting.\n Ordinarily, this would be a straightforward-seeming transaction, but under the terms of the .org  Registry Agreement, ISOC had to get approval from ICANN for the sale (or at least for PIR to retain the contract):\n 7.5\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Change of Control; Assignment and Subcontracting.\u00a0 Except as set forth in this Section 7.5, neither party may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.\u00a0 For purposes of this Section 7.5, a direct or indirect change of control of Registry Operator or any subcontracting arrangement that relates to any Critical Function (as identified in Section 6 of Specification 10) for the TLD (a \u201cMaterial Subcontracting Arrangement\u201d) shall be deemed an assignment.\n Soon after the proposed transaction was announced, a number of organizations (especially Access Now and EFF) started to surface concerns about the transaction. You can find a detailed writeup of those concerns  here but I think a fair summary of the argument is that .org was special (and in particular that a lot of NGOs relied on it) and that Ethos could not be trusted to manage it responsibly. A number of concerns were raised, including that Ethos might aggressively raise prices in order to maximize their profit or that they could be more susceptible to governmental pressure to remove the domain names of NGOs that were critical of them. You can find Mozilla\u2019s comments on the proposed sale  here. The California Attorney General\u2019s Office also  weighed in opposing the sale in a letter that implied it might take independent action to stop it, saying:\n This office will continue to evaluate this matter, and will take whatever action necessary to protect Californians and the nonprofit community.\n In turn, Ethos and ISOC mounted a fairly aggressive PR  campaign of their own, including creating a number of new commitments intended to alleviate concerns that had been raised, such as a new \u201cStewardship Council\u201d with some level of input into privacy and policy decisions, an amendment to the operating agreement with ICANN to provide for additional potential oversight going forward, and a promise not to raise prices by more than 10%/year for 8 years. At the end of the day these efforts did not succeed: ICANN announced on April 30 that they would withhold consent for the deal (see  here for their reasoning).\n  As far as I can tell, this decision merely returns the situation to the status quo ante (see this  post by Milton Mueller for some more detailed analysis). In particular, ISOC will continue to operate PIR and be able to benefit from the automatic renewal (and the agreement runs through 2029 in any case). To the extent to which you trusted PIR to manage .org responsibly a month ago, there\u2019s no reason to think that has changed (of course, people\u2019s opinions may have changed because of the proposed sale). However, as Mueller points out, none of the commitments that Ethos made in order to make the deal more palatable apply here, and in particular, thanks to the new contract in 2019, PIR ISOC is free to raise prices without being bound by the 10% annual commitment that Ethos had offered.\n It\u2019s worth noting that \u201cSave dot Org\u201d at least doesn\u2019t seem happy to leave .org in the hands of ISOC and in particular has called for ICANN to rebid the contract. Here\u2019s what they say:\n This is not the final step needed for protecting the .Org domain. ICANN must now open a public process for bids to find a new home for the .Org domain. ICANN has established processes and criteria that outline how to hold a reassignment process. We look forward to seeing a competitive process and are eager to support the participation in that process by the global nonprofit community.\n For ICANN to actually try to take .org away from ISOC seems like it would be incredibly contentious and ICANN hasn\u2019t given any real signals about what they intend to do here. It\u2019s possible they will try to rebid the contract (though it\u2019s not clear to me exactly whether the contract terms really permit this) or that they\u2019ll just be content to leave things as they are, with ISOC running .org through 2029.\n Regardless of what the Internet Society and ICANN choose to do here, I think that this has revealed the extent to which the current domain name ecosystem depends on informal understandings of what the various actors are going to do, as opposed to formal commitments to do them. For instance, many opposed to the sale seem to have expected that ISOC would continue to manage .org in the public interest and felt that the Ethos sale threatened that. However, as a practical matter the registry agreement doesn\u2019t include any such obligation and in particular nothing really stops them from raising prices much higher in order to maximize profit as opponents argued Ethos might do (although ISOC\u2019s nonprofit status means they can\u2019t divest those profits directly). Similarly, those who were against the sale and those who were in favor of it seem to have had rather radically different expectations about what ICANN was supposed to do (actively ensure that .org be managed in a specific way versus just keep the system running with a light touch) and at the end of the day were relying on ICANN\u2019s discretion to act one way or the other.

"note_en": "If we cannot resume economic activity without causing a resurgence of Covid-19 infections, we face a grim, unpredictable future of opening and closing schools and businesses.\n We can find a way out of this dilemma by exploiting a key property of the virus: its latent period \u2014 the three-day delay on average between the time a person is infected and the time he or she can infect others.\n People can work in two-week cycles, on the job for four days then, by the time they might become infectious, 10 days at home in lockdown. The strategy works even better when the population is split into two groups of households working alternating weeks.\n Austrian school officials will adopt a simple version \u2014 with two groups of students attending school for five days every two weeks \u2014 starting May 18.\n Models we created at the Weizmann Institute in Israel predict that this two-week cycle can reduce the virus\u2019s reproduction number \u2014 the average number of people infected by each infected person \u2014 below one. So a 10-4 cycle could suppress the epidemic while allowing sustainable economic activity.\n  Even if someone is infected, and without symptoms, he or she would be in contact with people outside their household for only four days every two weeks, not 10 days, as with a normal schedule. This strategy packs another punch: It reduces the density of people at work and school, thus curtailing the transmission of the virus.\n Schools could have students attend for four consecutive days every two weeks, in two alternating groups, and use distance-learning methods on the other school days. Children would go to school on the same days as their parents go to work.\n Businesses would work almost continuously, alternating between two groups of workers, for regular and predictable production. This would increase consumer confidence, shoring up supply and demand simultaneously.\n During lockdown days, this approach requires adherence only to the level of distancing already being demonstrated in European countries and New York City. It prevents the economic and psychological costs of opening the economy and then having to reinstate complete lockdown when cases inevitably resurge. Giving hope and then taking it away can cause despair and resistance.\n A 10-4 routine provides at least part-time employment for millions who have been fired or sent on leave without pay. These jobs prevent the devastating, and often long-lasting, mental and physical impacts of unemployment. For those living on cash, there would be four days to make a living, reducing the economic necessity to disregard lockdown altogether. Business bankruptcies would also be reduced, speeding up eventual economic recovery.\n The cyclic strategy is easy to explain and to enforce. It is equitable in terms of who gets to go back to work. It applies at any scale: a school, a firm, a town, a state. A region that uses the cyclic strategy is protected: Infections coming from the outside cannot spread widely if the reproduction number is less than one. It is also compatible with all other countermeasures being developed.\n Workers can, and should still, use masks and distancing while at work. This proposal is not predicated, however, on large-scale testing, which is not yet available everywhere in the United States and may never be available in large parts of the world. It can be started as soon as a steady decline of cases indicates that lockdown has been effective.\n The cyclic strategy should be part of a comprehensive exit strategy, including self-quarantine by those with symptoms, contact tracing and isolation, and protection of risk groups. The cyclic strategy can be tested in limited regions for specific trial periods, even a month. If infections rates grow, it can be adjusted to fewer work days. Conversely, if things are going well, additional work days can be added. In certain scenarios, only four or five lockdown days in each two-week cycle could still prevent resurgence.\n The coronavirus epidemic is a formidable foe, but it is not unbeatable. By scheduling our activities intelligently, in a way that accounts for the virus\u2019s intrinsic dynamics, we can defeat it more rapidly, and accelerate a full return to work, school and other activities.\n Uri Alon and Ron Milo are professors of computational and systems biology at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.

His books include &#34;Computer: A History of the Information Machine,&#34; co-authored with William Aspray, &#34;From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry,&#34; and &#34;ICL: A Business and Technical History.&#34; He is editor of the Collected Works of Charles Babbage. Professor Campbell-Kelly is a Fellow of the British Computer Society, visiting professor at Portsmouth University, and a columnist for the Communications of the ACM. He is a member of the ACM History Committee, a council member of the British Society for the History of Mathematics, and a committee member of the BCS Computer Conservation Society. He is a member of the editorial boards of the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, the International Journal for the History of Engineering and Technology, the Rutherford Journal, and editor-in-chief of the Springer Series in the History of Computing.\n  31 October 2013     The History of Computing in Colour  Professor Martin Campbell-Kelly      View PDF    Print\n  In recent years there has been a spate of books with titles like The Second World War in Colour, The London Underground in Colour, and so on. These popular publications represent a new historical genre made possible by low-cost colour printing and electronic publication. For a long time colour illustration in historical publications was not possible because the economics of printing permitted nothing other than black and white. As a result there are coloured images in archives that are only now being rediscovered.\n  Coloured imagery leads to new viewpoints and narratives. At one level colour conveys a much greater emotional impact\u2014black and white cannot fully convey the horror of blood and fire in time of war, or the serenity of a blue sky in time of peace. Coloured images were expensive to produce, relatively rare, and the happenstance of their creation suggests different pathways through history. This lecture offers some novel byways in computer history suggested by colour imagery. Although the lecture is confined to the specific domain of the history of computing, it is also a call for historical researchers in general to give more attention to illustration and to exploit the dramatic potential of low-cost colour reproduction.\n   Colour Imaging Technology is a short history of colour illustration, with examples from the domain of information processing. These include hand-coloured engravings, toned and tinted photographs, chromolithography, the 3-colour process, duotones, and rotogravure.\n  Before the Database illustrates the development of filing systems in the early twentieth century, showing their context in the office environment and how this fed into the post-war computer industry. Filing systems were of two types that quickly became a commodity: loose-leaf vertical filing cabinets, and card-index systems. However, two American firms, Rand and Kardex, developed innovative (and heavily patented) refinements of filing that turned them into successful worldwide operations. In 1927 the firms merged with Remington Typewriter to form Remington Rand. In 1952 Remington Rand produced the Univac, the first commercial computer.\n  Eliot Noyes and Mainframe Design describes the evolution of computer design inside IBM. Before the war, IBM was a laggard in industrial design\u2014the company\u2019s office machines, with their sombre colours and Queen Anne legs, could have been designed in the Victorian era. In 1937 IBM hired Norman Bel Geddes to give its products a streamlined look, but these did not reach the market until the late 1940s. In 1952 IBM\u2019s chief executive Thomas Watson Jr hired the Bauhaus-inspired designer Eliot Noyes to transform all of IBM\u2019s products. His first success was the iconic IBM Selectric golf-ball typewriter.\u00a0 He went on to create the \u201ccomputer look\u201d, a zeitgeist that affected not just IBM, but pervaded the whole computer industry and sci-fi movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey.", "posttime": "2020-05-12 09:41:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

Vasquez, the burly mountain man whose awestruck reaction upon seeing a double rainbow propelled him to internet stardom and turned him into a folk hero, has died in Central California. He was 57.\n  Vasquez, who called himself Yosemitebear on social media, died early Saturday at a hospital emergency room, the Mariposa County coroner\u2019s office told the  Modesto Bee.\n  The cause of death has not been released. Vasquez had recently posted on his Facebook page that he had gone to get tested for COVID-19 but learned about another unspecified ailment.\n  In January 2010, Vasquez posted  on YouTube a video shot from his mountainside house of a set of rainbows overlooking the Yosemite valley. He notes in the caption that the camera couldn\u2019t capture the rainbows\u2019 intensity and brightness.\n  But that wasn\u2019t what led to 46 million views of the video. It was Vasquez\u2019s reaction.\n  Over the course of the 3-minute video, he repeatedly said \u201cwhoa,\u201d laughed and even sobbed as he marveled at the sight of the rainbows.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s a double rainbow all the way across the sky!\u201d he exclaimed.\n    The video went viral that summer after talk show host Jimmy Kimmel tweeted about it, and it led to appearances on a number of TV shows and commercials for Smartwater, Microsoft and Delta Air Lines.\n        \u201cHis \u2018Double Rainbow\u2019 basically wrote the book on what a viral video was,\u201d Vasquez\u2019s friend, Robert Borchard, told the Bee. He called Vasquez an \u201camazing character\u201d who was always enthusiastic about the world.\n  In a 2015 interview with CNN, Vasquez said he was working as a Los Angeles County firefighter before moving in the mid 1980s to Mariposa, where he worked odd jobs and lived alone in a mobile home close to Yosemite National Park.\n  A cannabis grower and user, he said he wasn\u2019t high when he shot the video. He told CNN that his solitude allowed him to connect to nature on a deep level and gave him a freedom most people could never understand.\n  \u201cYou can\u2019t look at a rainbow anymore and not think about me,\u201d he said.\n    Get The Brief.

"note_en": "How immigration, ingenuity and the American spirit shaped a US fried chicken \u201cwar\u201d that\u2019s been simmering for four generations.\n        Located in the heart of the US\u2019 Great Plains, the area around Pittsburg, Kansas, spreads out like one vast prairie. Here, the winds blow bitter cold in winter; the sun parches the soil in summer; and ranchers, farmers and folks from this 20,000-person community gather to watch Friday night football at the local high school. By all accounts, this former coal-mining town is pretty tranquil \u2013 that is, until the topic of fried chicken comes up.\n While travelling is on hold due to the coronavirus outbreak, BBC Travel will continue to inform and inspire our readers who want to learn about the world as much as they want to travel there, offering stories that\u00a0celebrate the people, places and cultures that make this world so wonderfully diverse and amazing.\n For travel information and stories specifically related to coronavirus, please read\u00a0 the latest updates from our\u00a0colleagues\u00a0at BBC News.\n Over the past 80 years, this unassuming city has become one of the US\u2019 fried chicken epicentres, and it all started when two women opened chicken joints 300ft apart on the same street \u2013 thus creating a local rivalry that still spits and simmers today. Four generations later, their descendants still use their grandmothers\u2019 recipes to continue their legacies, and in many ways, who these women were and how their crispy birds got Pittsburg clucking speaks volumes about the heart and history of America\u2019s Heartland.\n  The plains surrounding Pittsburg have always been home to large deposits of bituminous coal. These pitch-black rocks were once so abundant that they were found above ground. The Osage Native Americans who once lived here called it \u201cblack rocks that make fire\u201d, and they traded it with white settlers.\n The first miners arrived in 1866, just one year after the US Civil War ended. Digging deep shafts and breaking apart loads of coal was dangerous, back-breaking work. Soon, notices went out across Europe seeking immigrants to come work in Pittsburg and the surrounding Crawford County. At the height of coal production here in 1914, more than 12,000 miners and their families called Crawford County home, and this rural patch of roughly 55,000 people produced more than one third of the US\u2019 coal.\n One of the families who settled in the area was the Rehaks, who sailed over from Austria at the turn of the 20th Century, carrying their infant daughter, Annie. As a teenager, Annie married Charles Pichler. The couple had three children and bought a house in the shadow of the coal mine just outside Pittsburg where Charles worked.\n  In the middle of Charles\u2019 shift one day in March 1933, the mine whistle blew four times, indicating that there had been an accident. Charles had been hit by a coal cart on the mine tracks. His right leg was amputated on site and his left leg was badly maimed. At the time, there was no such thing as workman\u2019s compensation or disability insurance, and Annie was forced to provide for her family of five in the middle of the US\u2019  Great Depression all alone.\n  To keep her family from starving, Annie began selling ham and veal sandwiches for a few pennies to miners passing the front of her house. The men ate under the shade of the birch and maple trees outside the Pichlers\u2019 little white house, not far from the outhouses, and drank Annie\u2019s homemade hooch, which she sold for $0.25 for two quarts.\n \u201cGrandma never talked much about those times, but it had to have been tough,\u201d said Anthony Pichler, Annie\u2019s grandson. \u201cBut Grandma was tough too, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d\n  In 1934, looking for a way to grow her business and noting all the free-range chickens in her front yard, Annie started selling fried chicken dinners. She\u2019d wring the birds\u2019 necks, quickly clean and cut them into pieces and fry them on a coal-heated stove in her tiny kitchen. On Saturdays, Annie would move the furniture from the family\u2019s living room and set up a few tables for diners in their tiny home. She also prepared potato salad, coleslaw, pickled peppers and sliced tomatoes from her garden as sides, and rounded the meals out with a slice of white bread. Sometimes, diners would stay and end up dancing until the wee hours of the morning.\n One day not long after Annie started her business, a local doctor and fan of Annie\u2019s cooking suggested she name her homespun business \u201cChicken Annie\u2019s\u201d. The name has stuck like grease on a pan ever since.\n Sometimes, diners would stay and end up dancing until the wee hours of the morning\n In 1941, a pair of German immigrants, Joe and Mary Zerngast, lived a few doors down from the Pichlers. Joe worked the mines as a \u201cshot-firer\u201d, meaning he was the guy who would go deep inside, light the dynamite and run out \u2013 hopefully before it exploded. It was one of the most dangerous jobs in the mines, and after 20 years, \u201cblack lung\u201d (coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis) cut his career short, leaving Mary to provide for the family.\n  The Zerngasts also had chickens clucking around in their front yard, a big cast-iron skillet and a coal-fired stove. And like Annie, Mary was a pretty good cook, too. So, just as the Pichlers had done, the Zerngasts cleared out the furniture in their little living room, set up tables and began selling fried chicken dinners with potato salad and coleslaw.\n Chicken Annie\u2019s and Chicken Mary\u2019s quickly developed a friendly rivalry, with locals in this tight-knit community having to pick a side\n \u201cI needed to survive,\u201d Larry Zerngast, Mary\u2019s grandson, recalled Mary telling the family.\n At first, the Zerngasts called their little place, \u201cJoe and Mary\u2019s\u201d. They had a jukebox in the living room and, just like at Annie\u2019s, people often danced until the early morning. If locals under the influence arrived in the middle of the night craving fried chicken, they would often pound on the door, shouting, \u201cChicken, Mary! Chicken, Mary!\u201d. Mary would open the door, fire up the coal stove and fry chicken until dawn \u2013 thus, Chicken Mary\u2019s was born.\n  The Pichler\u2019s and Zerngast\u2019s little houses soon got so busy with dinners and dancing that the families had to move so they could devote their former homes solely to the restaurant business. Word continued to spread of the families\u2019 mouth-watering, deep-fried birds after World War Two, and poultry pilgrims would drive hours across Kansas to dine at Annie\u2019s or Mary\u2019s \u2013 or sometimes, both. As more people flocked to eat at their venues in the 1960s and \u201870s, the ladies tore down their original houses and expanded again, building modern restaurants with commercial kitchens that could seat about 300 instead of 30.\n \u201cShe always had a smile and would greet her guests by name,\u201d said Donna Lipoglav, Annie\u2019s granddaughter, who recalled that Annie\u2019s waitresses always wore crisp white dresses and aprons. \u201cShe was very sweet and gentle, and no, I don\u2019t think she would approve of my sweatshirt today.\u201d\n Despite having nearly identical recipes and side dishes, Chicken Annie\u2019s and Chicken Mary\u2019s quickly developed a friendly rivalry, with locals in this tight-knit community having to pick a side and be careful who saw them entering the door of which restaurant.\n  Lipoglav\u2019s earliest memories are of working in the house with her grandmother, clearing tables and serving guests. Occasionally, Annie would ask her to ride her bike down the street to count the number of cars in Chicken Mary\u2019s parking lot. \u201cI think Grandma was alert as to what was going on,\u201d Lipoglav said. \u201cOur parking lot was always just as full as Mary\u2019s.\u201d\n My Grandpa Joe always said, \u2018Don\u2019t turn your back on a Pichler, you can\u2019t trust them!\n In 1982, the Pichlers tried to rename the small street running in front of both establishments \u201cChicken Annie\u2019s Road\u201d. When the Zerngasts objected to that, the incident made national headlines with a tongue-in-cheek article in The New Yorker titled, \u201c Fried-Chicken War\u201d.\n \u201cMy Grandpa Joe always said, \u2018Don\u2019t turn your back on a Pichler, you can\u2019t trust them!\u2019,\u201d Donna Zerngast, Mary\u2019s granddaughter, laughed.\n  Today, Pittsburg\u2019s first families of fried chicken are still at it, with Lipoglav running  Chicken Annie\u2019s Original, Larry Zerngast running  Chicken Mary\u2019s and Anthony Pichler running  Pichler\u2019s Chicken Annie\u2019s alongside an unlikely co-owner: Donna Zerngast, who must not have listened to Grandpa Joe\u2019s advice and has now been married to a Pichler for the last 54 years.\n  Other than the size of the buildings and the fact that they\u2019re no longer wringing the chickens\u2019 necks themselves, all three businesses still do everything just about the same way Annie and Mary did in the 1930s and \u201840s. Each still batters their birds, then coats them with flour and salt just minutes before frying them in lard. Chicken Mary\u2019s uses egg and milk in the batter; whereas Chicken Annie\u2019s Original and Pichler\u2019s Chicken Annie\u2019s uses just egg.\n We have customers who just show up from all across the country because they\u2019ve heard of us and the fried chicken in this part of Kansas\n To this Midwesterner, the chicken at both Annie\u2019s and Mary\u2019s has a crisp, light crunch and a tender, juicy inside. But Pittsburg residents know the difference.\n \u201cYou can put a plate of our chicken next to a plate of their chicken and locals will know which one is which,\u201d said Lana Brooks, who has worked at Chicken Mary\u2019s for 51 years and claims that both families use the same seasonings, just in different amounts. \u201cI think the key to success in both restaurants is that we\u2019re still doing things exactly as Mary and Annie did it. That\u2019s part of the appeal to families who have been coming here their whole life. It\u2019s a part of our community heritage.\u201d\n  Over the years, Chicken Annie\u2019s and Mary\u2019s have inspired at least nine other homespun fried chicken joints in Crawford County. \u201cWe have very loyal customers, but every week, we have customers who just show up from all across the country because they\u2019ve heard of us and the fried chicken in this part of Kansas,\u201d said Missy Pichler, the fourth generation of Pichlers to work at Chicken Annie\u2019s Original and whose teenage daughter also waits tables there.\n Every few months, Steve and Melissa Pulis and their boys drive about two hours from Springfield, Missouri, to Pittsburg, eating at Chicken Mary\u2019s on one trip and Chicken Annie\u2019s the next.\n \u201cI like Annie\u2019s chicken the best, but Steve likes Mary\u2019s the best,\u201d said Melissa. \u201cBut it\u2019s the opposite with the coleslaw. I really like the extra garlic in Mary\u2019s coleslaw. Steve disagrees.\u201d\n  And that\u2019s the way it goes in Crawford County. Families here are divided in a delicious brawl over fried chicken and the fixins.\n Al Eshelbrenner grew up just north of Pittsburg and has been eating fried chicken dinners for nearly 60 years. While he admits that Chicken Mary\u2019s is good, he insists that the difference lies in the seasoning. Today, he maintains his parents\u2019 allegiance and now takes his grandchildren to Chicken Annie\u2019s. \u201cMy folks would take us to Chicken Annie\u2019s every Sunday and that\u2019s just what I grew up with,\u201d said Eshelbrenner. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really argue about it down here because we respect that everyone has their favourites, their family tradition.\u201d\n In fact, the Eshelbrenners are so devoted to Chicken Annie\u2019s that they ask the restaurant to cater their family\u2019s Christmas gatherings.\n  \u201cI think it\u2019s the potato salad and coleslaw that I crave the most,\u201d said Kristian Walker, who was born and raised in Pittsburg but now lives in Harrisburg, PA. Although he no longer has family living in the area, he once drove five hours out of his way just so he could have a fried chicken dinner in Pittsburg.\n \u201cI\u2019ve met people from across the country who, as soon as they learn I\u2019m from Pittsburg, start asking me about my favourite fried chicken and telling about the times they\u2019ve been able to eat [it],\u201d he said. \u201cWe might not be world famous, but there are sure a lot of people around the world who know about the fried chicken of Crawford County, Kansas.\u201d\n Join more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0 Facebook , or follow us on\u00a0 Twitter \u00a0and\u00a0 Instagram .\n If you liked this story,\u00a0 sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter \u00a0called &#34;The Essential List&#34;.
