"note_en": "A year ago Bitsy  released on itch.io \u2013 a humble game making tool described by its creator as a \u201clittle editor for little games or worlds\u201d. Since its release, more than 600 games have been made using the tool by 300 different authors.\n On the surface Bitsy is an unassuming engine. It lets you create small pixel-art rooms that players can explore by interacting with the people and objects within them. Its simplicity hides a surprising depth, one that has drawn in a community of game makers.\u201cBitsy came from my own frustrations with trying to finish a game,\u201d says Adam Le Doux, Bitsy\u2019s creator. \u201cNaturally, the solution was to build a new game engine from scratch! I wanted to stop worrying about programming details, screen resolutions, platform differences, post-processing effects. I wanted to be able to immediately work on the heart of what I was trying to create: a world with a story.\u201d\n He was inspired by his favourite spaces in games \u2013 towns in 2D RPGs like Zelda, Pokemon and Final Fantasy, and walking simulators like Gone Home. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved walking around and talking to everyone to learn about their personal problems or the history of the town. Games like that gave me confidence that those ingredients \u2013 a place and its inhabitants \u2013 were enough to make something interesting.\u201d\n  He created Bitsy as a simple engine that doesn\u2019t require coding knowledge to create something within it. It\u2019s an engine built on constraint, restricting you to 8\u00d78 pixel tiles and a three colour palette.\n \u201cI made my first game about coming home to my apartment after work and finding my wife, Mary-Margaret, already napping on the couch and our cat begging for a snack,\u201d says Adam. It used an early version of Bitsy, which required everything to be typed into a text file that was then loaded into the engine.\n Adam created the web app version of the editor when Mary-Margaret and a few friends said they wanted to make their own games using it. He put it online, posted it on Twitter and figured that would be the end of it.\n  Bitsy took off. Game makers found that the editor\u2019s simplicity meant that they could make compelling games over a couple of evenings. The lowered stakes meant it was perfect for testing out ideas, making short mood pieces or expressing personal stories.\n Claire Morley was one of these designers. She was drawn in by Bitsy\u2019s distinctive art style, created as a byproduct of the engines constraints.\n  \u201cI played a few other games from the  Bitsy Moth Jam,\u201d she says. \u201cI loved how they all felt really similar, yet so distinct from each other. They all felt mysterious, but personal. They almost feel like they\u2019re all from an alien or ancient culture, connected together, and by playing them I was scratching the surface of something magical.\u201d\n Claire decided she wanted to make her own game. She made  Cat\u2019s Out of the Bag! for the next jam, a game about sneaking around a highschool and listening to people\u2019s conversations. She\u2019s since made a handful of Bitsy games featuring  train journeys,  snowblindness and  a message in a bottle.\n \u201cBitsy strips away anything that\u2019s not completely necessary to making an interactive story. It\u2019s a very focused and limited tool, but those limitations mean you don\u2019t have all this noise about what art style to use or how to set up controls,\u201d says Claire. \u201cWhile those are important things, the absence of them means that it\u2019s easier to get to the core of the story, experience or message you\u2019re trying to convey. It\u2019s why Bitsy games often feel so conceptually strong.\u201d\n Bitsy games feel like they belong to a distinct form of game making, one with its own rules and visual language. Making a game in Bitsy feels equivalent to deciding to record a film using Super 8 or shooting photos with an analogue camera. While it\u2019s easy to learn for beginners, there\u2019s still lots of space for experienced creators to experiment with. It\u2019s led to people doing things with Bitsy that even Adam hadn\u2019t anticipated.\n \u201cPeople keep pushing against the constraints to invent new ways to use Bitsy that I never intended,\u201d says Adam. People have made  short films, procedurally generated  radio tuners and  astronomy simulators using Bitsy. Much of this inventiveness has been driven by the community that has formed around the tool.\n  \u201cIf development of Bitsy itself froze today, I think we could still spend years finding interesting ways to use it,\u201d says game and tool maker Mark Wonnacott, who is passionate about the community that has formed around the engine.\n \u201cPeople are actually using it and playing each others games,\u201d they explain. \u201cThere\u2019s a good community of people helping and encouraging each other. People have drawn parallels between Bitsy and Twine, but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re thinking about the tool as much as the shape of the scene forming round it.\u201d\n Both Claire and Mark are at the heart of that scene. Claire has been pivotal in creating spaces for the community to flourish. Alongside Lorenzo Pilia (programme manager for  A Maze and part of the Global Game Jam executive committee) she set up @bitsypcs, a Twitter account that shares news about Bitsy and games made in the engine.\n The Twitter account led to the pair setting up a Discord, Bitsy Talk, which has become an unofficial home of the community. It\u2019s a welcoming space where people can go and \u201cshare ideas, games and add-on tools\u201d. There you can find people who\u2019ve made half a dozen games giving tips to complete beginners.\n  Mark has become something of a Bitsy archivist. They created the  Bitsy Omnibus, a catalogue of every Bitsy game. It was originally motivated by another of their projects, the Bitsy Boutique, a hardware player for Bitsy games made using a PocketCHIP mounted in a jewellery box.\n  \u201cI wanted to work out how to elevate Bitsy games from individual web games into something you could exhibit somewhere,\u201d explains Mark, \u201cTo get it in front of people who aren\u2019t playing tiny webgames already. The response from creators has been unanimously positive so far, people are excited to see their works recognised as part of a larger whole.\u201d\n Its first showing has just been announced for Rezzed\u2019s  Leftfield Collection. It\u2019s one of the ways Bitsy is starting to move beyond online spaces. There are meetups in Brighton and Seattle, and Claire and Mark are working together to host one in Bristol. Claire is also hosting a workshop to teach kids to make games using Bitsy (she\u2019s previously taught her  Dad).\n  \u201cSeeing the community take shape has been the most magical and inspiring thing about working on Bitsy.\u201d says Adam, \u201cWithout their creativity and hard work, we wouldn\u2019t be talking about Bitsy right now. All the ways they use the engine has driven what I\u2019ve added to it, and given me the energy to keep working on the project.\u201d\n This energy goes both ways. The community sprung from Adam\u2019s willingness to listen to thoughts, questions and feedback. He\u2019s also the host of a monthly game jam that has inspired many to make their first game. The community hasn\u2019t sprung up from nowhere: Adam\u2019s recognition of its importance and his willingness to nurture it is a reason for its growth.\n \u201cThe community is crucial for people who are maybe making a game or sharing one to a wider audience for the first time,\u201d says Adam. \u201cIt helps people to see that it\u2019s accepted and celebrated to make something small, or personal, or incomplete.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-09 20:18:19", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,\u5236\u9020\u5546,game,bitsy",

"note_en": "\u201cJapanese researchers are closing in on understanding why electrical storms have a positive influence on the growth of some fungi,\u201d   Physics World reported last month, with some interesting implications for agriculture.\n These electrical storms do not have to be nearby, and they do not even need to be natural: \u201cIn a series of experiments, Koichi Takaki at Iwate University and colleagues showed that artificial lightning strikes do not have to directly strike shiitake mushroom cultivation beds to promote growth.\u201d Instead, it seems one can coax mushrooms into fruiting using even just the indirect presence of electrical fields.\n As the article explains, \u201catmospheric electricity has long been known to boost the growth of living things, including plants, insects and rats,\u201d but mushrooms appear to respond even to regional electrical phenomena\u2014for example, when a distant lightning storm rolls by. \u201cIn Takaki\u2019s previous studies, yield increases were achieved by running a direct current through a shiitake mushroom log. But Takaki still wondered\u2014why do natural electric storms indirectly influenced [sic] the growth of mushrooms located miles away from the lightning strikes?\u201d\n Whether or not power lines or electricity-generation facilities, such as power plants, might also affect\u2014or even catalyze\u2014mushroom growth is not clear.\n For now, Takaki is hoping to develop some kind of electrical-stimulation technique for mushroom growth, with an eye on the global food market.\n  It is quite astonishing to imagine that, someday, those mushrooms you\u2019re eating in a gourmet pasta dish were grown inside some sort of wild, Nikola Tesla-like electrical cage, half  X-Men, half food-technology of the near-future\u2014underground shining domes of fungal power.\n  The opening image of this post, meanwhile, is from a surreal field trip I took back in 2009 with Nicola Twilley to visit the \u201c mushroom tunnel of Mittagong,\u201d a disused rail tunnel in southeast Australia that is\u2014or, as of 2009, was\u2014used as a subterranean mushroom-growth facility. Imagine this tunnel quietly pulsing with electricity in the darkness, humid, strobing, its wet logs fruiting with directed fungi.\n Electrical mushroom-control techniques, or where the future of food production merges imperceptibly with the world of H.P.

"note_en": "This article is part of my  Confessions of an Unintentional CTO book, which is currently available to read for free online.\n We web application owners often want to accept credit card payments for whatever we sell. Because rolling our own  security-compliant merchant solutions is both risky and time-consuming, we usually offload the hassle to payment providers like PayPal or Stripe.\n At first glance, the fee schedule for these services seems reasonable enough, but sadly, there\u2019s a lot of small print and there are plenty of hidden gotchas that are costly yet difficult to detect up front. To give but one example: When I wrote the first draft of this post way back in December 2015, the homepage of PayPal advertised that \u201cin most cases\u201d they charge a 1.9% transaction fee for their services. Sounds OK-ish, right? In reality, my average fee that month was a whopping 8.8%\u2014four times more than I was led to expect. So where do all these extra charges enter the picture?\n  Part of the beauty of the web is that it connects people, despite traditional national borders; there\u2019s nothing stopping customers from Australia or Brazil or Qatar from stopping by your website and buying something. Of course, even though the web transcends national borders, it nevertheless exists in a bordered world. As such, your international customers will want to buy using their own currency, which will probably differ from the one predominant in your homeland.\n Web application owners have two choices here: bill in the customer\u2019s currency or bill in their own currency.\n For the purposes of illustration, I\u2019ll assume from here that your business operates in EUR and your customer wants to buy with GBP.\n  The customer will have to pay a currency conversion fee, and this will be levied either by their credit card provider (Visa etc.) or the payment provider you integrated into your website (PayPal et al). Although you personally avoid currency conversion fees in this case, this approach is nevertheless commercially untenable for most businesses. Aside from tarnishing your reputation by exposing the customer to extra hidden fees, this approach has an even more immediate downside: it scares and confuses customers who, upon seeing your website pricing and billing in EUR instead of their home GBP, now feel your products are somehow foreign, inappropriate, or even inferior to those sold by competitors billing in their local currency. This in turn chips away at your conversion rates.\n  The consequence here is that your payment provider account will accumulate GBP holdings. But because your business needs EUR to pay its bills, sooner or later you\u2019ll have to convert the GBP into EUR. Here\u2019s where payment providers fleece you: there is often a small print stipulation that you are not allowed to withdraw money to your bank account without first converting money to your home currency (EUR)  through their platform. The catch is that their currency conversion rate\u2014the one you are forced to accept\u2014is between 2.5% and 4.5% higher than the normal market rates available at that time. The payment providers will tell you that this surcharge exists to cover them in case of \u201cmarket fluctuations\u201d. This is utter rubbish and represents an almost criminal misrepresentation of the magnitude of the risk. By way of comparison, normal banks\u2014such as Deutsche Bank\u2014are subject to this exact same risk, but they charge only 0.1% above the market rate. Go figure.\n In the cases of  some payment providers transacting with certain narrow combinations of currencies, there is respite and you can sometimes withdraw money without forced currency exchanges. For example, with Stripe in Germany, you are allowed to withdraw GBP to a GBP-denominated bank account based in Germany, thereby avoiding the forced currency conversion fee that would otherwise apply when withdrawing to a EUR bank account. That said, even Stripe doesn\u2019t offer the same possibility for many other countries and currencies. And, needless to say, the good people at PayPal  always force you to withdraw in EUR if you are based in a EUR country, meaning you can never avoid their obscene currency conversion fees. The only way around their system is to open up a bank account in the UK, then open up a separate PayPal account there for your GBP transactions, and then finally build a software merry-go-round to switch PayPal accounts depending on your customer\u2019s currency.\n All in all, the accounting and administrative hassle involved with circumnavigating a payment provider\u2019s currency conversion fees may not be worth it for many small businesses, and as such, they are forced to grin and bear the inflated fees.\n  The rosy picture painted on payment providers\u2019 home pages also quotes you a rate for  domestic transactions, that is, for customers based in the same country as you. Given that the internet is a global community, it could well be the case that more than 90% of your customers are international. If so, you\u2019ll be charged up to an additional 3% in fees. This is  in addition to the fees for currency conversion, meaning that the total of extra fees for international customers can amount to up to 7.5%.\n  Some payment providers, like PayPal, allow your past customers to file disputes with them directly. All too often, this is a vehicle for fraud. For example, imagine that a rogue places an order on your website, receives whatever electronic service you provide, then files a (dishonest) complaint with the payment provider, claiming that their card was stolen or that the goods didn\u2019t match the description. Meanwhile, this rogue continues to download your digital products or enjoy your service. PayPal claims to look at both sides of the case yet invariably it decides any dispute in favour of the customer, without considering any evidence you have, meaning you automatically lose a percentage of your sales thanks to easily prevented fraud. This is, in effect, an insidious hidden charge they place on your business, and one they use to bolster their reputation at your expense.", "posttime": "2020-05-09 18:00:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546,providers,\u8d27\u5e01", "title": "\u652f\u4ed8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u6b3a\u8d1f\u4f60(2015)", "title_en": "Payments Providers Screw You (2015)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/how-payments-providers-screw-you", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546", "providers", "\u8d27\u5e01"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5455dc5fac65f12010e709314226de7c.jpg", "infoid": 1001374, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u89c6\u98911701\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u673a\u5668\u6253\u5f00\u56fd\u4f1a\u5927\u53a6\u7684\u78c1\u9501\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u5b83\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\uff01\u83b7\u80dc\u8005\u4e0d\u60f3\u652f\u4ed8\u8fd0\u5f80\u6b27\u6d32\u7684\u8239\u8d39\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5979.", "note_en": "In video 1701 we get to machine open the Capitol Industries magnetic lock and see how it works!

on-site job interview at Google. The position I was interviewing for was a Google SRE. SRE stands for Site Reliability Engineering. Site reliability engineers (SREs) are both software engineers and systems administrators, responsible for Google&#39;s production services from end-to-end.\n I interviewed with eight separate people. The first three were over the phone and the remaining five were on-site. The first interview was with the recruiter and was not very technical but the other seven were technical.\n Unfortunately, I just learned that I&#39;m not getting hired. The recruiter said that &#34;the morning interviews were not that great&#34; and &#34;I should get more experience to work in their mission critical team.&#34;\n Update: This article has been  translated to Japanese.  Update: This article has been  translated to German.\n  Shortly after I published the  Code Reuse in Google Chrome post, I was contacted by a recruiter at Google. The email said:\n I recruit top notch Software Engineering talent at Google. I recently came across your name as a possible world class Engineer and am intrigued to know more about you. I promise to exchange some detailed info about us as well. Interested to hear more? Want to be an impact player at Google? Then please respond with a current (English) copy of your resume and I&#39;ll be happy to call you and discuss.\n At first I thought I would be applying for a software developer position but after we went through my skillset, the recruiter concluded that I would better fit as an SRE. I agreed with him. This seemed like a perfect position for me. I love system administration as much as I love programming.\n  The first interview was on 10th of September with the recruiter. He explained the Google recruitment process to me and we went through my skill set. I had to rank myself from 0 - 10 in a bunch of areas such as C programming (8), C++ programming (7), Python programming (6), networking (6), algorithms and data structures (6), distributed systems (5), Linux systems administration (9), and others.\n Based on my answers, we concluded that SRE was the best position for me. An SRE has to know everything: algorithms, data structures, programming, networking, distributed systems, scalable architecture, troubleshooting. It&#39;s a great hacker position!\n The second half of the interview had some basic technical questions to make sure I wasn&#39;t bluffing. The questions were about Linux systems administration, algorithms, computer architecture and C programming. You can find all questions from all interviews at the bottom of this post.\n I made a couple of mistakes but he was satisfied and we scheduled the next phone interview. He warned me that it will be very technical and I should do a really good preparation. I asked him to give me a plenty of time for the preparation and we scheduled the next interview on 22nd of September.\n He also told me that each phone interview is going to be 45 minutes to 1 hour long.\n I created a daily schedule and started preparing. I found three presentations on what SRE is all about:\n        As I did not know which programming language I will use in the next interviews, I went through dozens of recipes in  C++ Cookbook,  Python Cookbook, and  Perl Cookbook.\n  The second phone interview was with an engineer from Google. He worked on the Ads team which is responsible for running AdSense, AdWords, and other advertisement stuff.\n The interview was very technical and started with an algorithmic problem which was too large to fit in computer memory. I had to tell him precisely how I would get around this problem and what data structures and algorithms I would use. He also asked me to think out loudly. The interview continued with questions about data structures, DNS, TCP protocol, a security vulnerability associated with TCP, networking in general, and Google itself.\n   After the interview the engineer had to write feedback to the recruiter. It was positive and I could move on with the interview.\n  I gave myself more time to prepare and the third interview was on the 1st of October. It was with an engineer from the Google traffic team.\n In this interview, I had a very simple programming question and I had to do coding over phone. I was free to choose the language and I chose Perl as it is my most favorite programming language. It was impossible to dictate Perl syntax over phone &#34;for my dollar sign element open paren at data close paren open curly brace ... close curly brace&#34; so I submitted my Perl program over the email.\n   The question was: Write a program to find the set difference. Given two sets A and B, find elements in A-B, or in other words, find elements in set A that are not in B.\n Then the same problem was taken to the next level, what if the data we are working on is gigabytes in size, terabytes in size. How would my program/solution change?\n Finally I had a question about DNS again, then HTTP protocol, routing, and TCP data transfer.\n   The feedback was again positive and I could prepare for the on-site interviews. In my conversation with my recruiter I got to know that there will be five on-site interviews, each exactly 45 minutes long. One on my previous work experience, one on algorithms and data structures, one on troubleshooting and networking, and two on software development with the focus on C and C++.\n    The fourth interview was finally at Googleplex in Mountain View. At 10am I met my recruiter and we had a 15 minute discussion about the interviews. He told me I would have two interviews now, then one of Google engineers would take me to lunch in one of Google&#39;s restaurants and then I would have three other interviews.\n At 10:15am the first on-site interview began. It was about my previous job experience. I have had a lot of job experience in the past and I decided to tell about a physical security notification system that I coded in C on Linux a few years ago. The system received messages through the serial port, send out emails through SMTP, and text messages through a GSM modem.\n In the last minutes of the interview he asked me some basic Unix filesystem questions, such as, what is an inode?\n   The fifth interview began at 11am. It was a coding session and began with a trick question and not a real coding problem. The trick question was this: &#34;What&#39;s the angle between clock hands when it&#39;s 3:15?&#34; Then I was asked to implement the solution in C for arbitrary time (hour/minute). The solution was a mathematical expression that was a one-line return statement. Then I was asked to write an implementation of a binary tree on the whiteboard. While coding, I forgot to initialize a data structure that I had mallow()&#39;ed. The program would have segfault&#39;ed in real life and I would have noticed the error. I said there were no errors here but the Google engineer pointed out I hadn&#39;t initialized data.\n After this interview I was taken to lunch by the engineer who interviewed me on the second phone interview. She told me she was working at Google for two years and was very happy about it. We went to Asian food restaurant in Googleplex. Then she showed me around Googleplex.\n  The sixth interview began at 12:45pm. It was a troubleshooting and networking interview. The interviewer drew a network diagram on the whiteboard and had imagined a problem in there. I had to ask a bunch of specific networking questions to locate the problem. He was satisfied and in the last few minutes of the interview he asked me some specific networking device questions, like what&#39;s the difference between a router and a switch, and what&#39;s OSI model.\n  The seventh interview began at 1:30pm. It was a coding session. I was asked to implement a simple string manipulation subroutine that finds common characters in two C strings. I could use either C or C++. I chose C. I made an off-by-one mistake there. The whole interview focused on this one problem.\n  The last, eight, interview began at 2:15pm. It was algorithms and data structures interview. The problem presented here was similar to the problem in the 2nd interview. Not only was it a problem too large to fit in computer memory but it also was distributed. How to sort data that doesn&#39;t fit in memory and you&#39;ve got 100 computers to sort it. I had to do all kinds of trickery to solve it. The interview was very free-style and we talked back and forth about the problem. I arrived at the correct solution near the end of the interview and he said that not many candidates got that far. I was also asked if I knew map-reduce and of course I knew map-reduce as I just had read the Google paper. This was a map-reduce problem.\n After the interview the engineer escorted me out to the lobby and I took a cab back to my hotel.\n  Overall, the Google interview was super fun. I love trivia questions like this. The questions were technical but not very challenging or difficult.\n  Given 100GB file and a computer with 1GB of memory, how would you sort it.", "posttime": "2020-05-09 17:29:23", "source_domain":

experienced less mental strain than the control group. They also had a more positive perception of their economic welfare. The interpretation of the employment effects of the experiment is complicated by the introduction of the activation model in 2018.\n    A two-year basic income experiment was carried out in Finland in 2017-2018. The evaluation study is now available. The register data on employment now cover both years of the experiment and a more thorough analysis has been made of the results of the survey. In addition, the interview-based survey of basic income recipients complements the overall picture.\n  In accordance with the preliminary plan for the evaluation, the employment effects of the basic income experiment were measured for the period from November 2017 to October 2018. The employment rate for basic income recipients improved slightly more during this period than for the control group. During the reference period, the basic income increased the number of days of employment by 6 days and the basic income recipients were employed for 78 days on average.\n  However, the interpretation of the effects of the experiment is made more complicated by the introduction of the activation model at the beginning of 2018, which meant more stringent entitlement criteria for unemployment benefits asymmetrically in both groups.\n  - The effects of the second year of the experiment cannot be separated from the effects of the activation model, says Kari H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, Chief Researcher at the VATT Institute for Economic Research.\n  During the first year of the experiment, when the activation model had not yet been introduced, the basic income did not have any employment effects for the basic income recipients at group level. However, the basic income seems to have had slightly different effects on different groups: for instance for families with children who received a basic income, employment rates improved during both years of the experiment. The results for different groups are still uncertain due to the small number of observations and the numerous tests.\n  - All in all, the employment effects were small. This indicates that for some persons who receive unemployment benefits from Kela the problems related to finding employment are not related to bureaucracy or to financial incentives, says H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen.\n    The effects of the basic income experiment on wellbeing were studied through a survey which was done by phone just before the experiment ended.\n  Survey respondents who received a basic income described their wellbeing more positively than respondents in the control group. They were more satisfied with their lives and experienced less mental strain, depression, sadness and loneliness. They also had a more positive perception of their cognitive abilities, i.e. memory, learning and ability to concentrate.\n  \u2013 In addition, the respondents who received a basic income had a more positive perception of their income and economic wellbeing than the control group. They were more likely to find that their financial situation is manageable and that they are protected financially, says Minna Ylik\u00e4nn\u00f6, Head of the Research Team at Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland).\n  The basic income recipients trusted other people and the institutions in society to a larger extent and were more confident in their own future and their ability to influence things than the control group. This may be due to the basic income being unconditional, which in previous studies has been seen to increase people\u2019s trust in the system.  \u00a0  \u2013 On the basis of the study, it is not possible to say with certainty that the better wellbeing of the test group was due specifically to receipt of a basic income. Then again, regional and local basic income experiments in other countries have also shown similar results of improved wellbeing, says Ylik\u00e4nn\u00f6.\n  The response rate for the survey was 23% (31% for the basic income recipients and 20% for the control group), which is typical for surveys.\n    A total of 81 basic income recipients were also interviewed for the study. The interviews highlight the diverse effects of the experiment and the differences in the starting points and life situations of the basic income recipients.\n  Some interviewees said that the basic income experiment clearly had an effect on employment whereas others said that the effects were small. The different starting points of the interviewees before the experiment also affected employment.\n  For some the experiment offered new opportunities of participating in society for instance through voluntary work or informal care. Many interviewees said that the basic income strengthened the feeling of autonomy. Even though the descriptions of the effects of the basic income were on the whole fairly positive, for some the experiment had also created pressure to find a job and difficulties with the ability to cope.\n  - The basic income seems to have increased activity of different kinds among those who were active already earlier. Then again, for those who were in a challenging life situation before the experiment, the basic income does not seem to have solved their problems, says Helena Blomberg-Kroll, professor at the University of Helsinki.\n    - The basic income experiment has provided valuable information about the possibilities of the social security system. The information provided by the experiment can also be used when reforming the social security system, says Aino-Kaisa Pekonen, Minister of Social Affairs and Health.\n  The Finnish basic income experiment was the world\u2019s first basic income experiment that was nationwide, statutory and based on a randomised field experiment. Participation in the experiment was not voluntary, which means that it is possible to draw more reliable conclusions of the effects of the experiment than is the case in other experiments which are based on voluntary participation.\n  - The implementation of the experiment was successful and it provided new information that would not have been available without the experiment. It also showed that in Finland the arranging of extensive social experiments is possible from a legislative viewpoint, says Olli Kangas, Programme Leader at the Strategic Research Council, Academy of Finland.\n  In the basic income experiment, 2,000 unemployed persons were paid a monthly tax-exempt basic income of 560 euros regardless of any other income they may have had or whether they were actively looking for work. The basic income recipients were selected through random sampling among those who in November 2016 received an unemployment benefit from Kela. The control group consisted of those who in November 2016 received an unemployment benefit from Kela but were not selected for the experiment.\n  The experiment was begun on 1 January 2017 and ended on 31 December 2018. The decision to conduct the experiment was made by the Government of the then Prime Minister Juha Sipil\u00e4. The aim was to study how it would be possible to reshape the Finnish social security system so that it better meets the challenges posed by changes in working life. The experiment was implemented by Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland).\n    The results of the basic income experiment will be published in an online broadcast on 6 May at 13.00-15.00 (Finnish time). The publication is arranged in cooperation between Kela, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and The University of Helsinki&#39;s Think Corner.

"note_en": "Humans\u2019 ability to efficiently shed heat has enabled us to range over every continent, but a wet-bulb temperature (TW) of 35\u00b0C marks our upper physiological limit, and much lower values have serious health and productivity impacts. Climate models project the first 35\u00b0C TW occurrences by the mid-21st century. However, a comprehensive evaluation of weather station data shows that some coastal subtropical locations have already reported a TW of 35\u00b0C and that extreme humid heat overall has more than doubled in frequency since 1979. Recent exceedances of 35\u00b0C in global maximum sea surface temperature provide further support for the validity of these dangerously high TW values. We find the most extreme humid heat is highly localized in both space and time and is correspondingly substantially underestimated in reanalysis products. Our findings thus underscore the serious challenge posed by humid heat that is more intense than previously reported and increasingly severe.\n Humans\u2019 bipedal locomotion, naked skin, and sweat glands are constituents of a sophisticated cooling system (  1). Despite these thermoregulatory adaptations, extreme heat remains one of the most dangerous natural hazards (  2), with tens of thousands of fatalities in the deadliest events so far this century (  3,   4). The additive impacts of heat and humidity extend beyond direct health outcomes to include reduced individual performance across a range of activities, as well as large-scale economic impacts (  5\u2013  7). Heat-humidity effects have prompted decades of study in military, athletic, and occupational contexts (  8,   9). However, consideration of wet-bulb temperature (TW) from the perspectives of climatology and meteorology began more recently (  10,   11).\n While some heat-humidity impacts can be avoided through acclimation and behavioral adaptation (  12), there exists an upper limit for survivability under sustained exposure, even with idealized conditions of perfect health, total inactivity, full shade, absence of clothing, and unlimited drinking water (  9,   10). A normal internal human body temperature of 36.8\u00b0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C requires skin temperatures of around 35\u00b0C to maintain a gradient directing heat outward from the core (  10,   13). Once the air (dry-bulb) temperature (T) rises above this threshold, metabolic heat can only be shed via sweat-based latent cooling, and at TW exceeding about 35\u00b0C, this cooling mechanism loses its effectiveness altogether. Because the ideal physiological and behavioral assumptions are almost never met, severe mortality and morbidity impacts typically occur at much lower values\u2014for example, regions affected by the deadly 2003 European and 2010 Russian heat waves experienced TW values no greater than 28\u00b0C (fig. S1). In the literature to date, there have been no observational reports of TW exceeding 35\u00b0C and few reports exceeding 33\u00b0C (  9,   11,   14,   15). The awareness of a physiological limit has prompted modeling studies to ask how soon it may be crossed. Results suggest that, under the business-as-usual RCP8.5 emissions scenario, TW could regularly exceed 35\u00b0C in parts of South Asia and the Middle East by the third quarter of the 21st century (  14\u2013  16).\n Here, we use quality-assured station observations from HadISD (  17,   18) and high-resolution reanalysis data from ERA-Interim (  19,   20), verified against radiosondes and marine observations (see the Supplementary Materials) (  21,   22), to compute TW baseline values, geographic patterns, and recent trends. Uncertainties in TW from station data due to instrumentation and procedures are on the order of 0.5\u00b0 to 1.0\u00b0C in all regions considered, an important consideration for proper interpretation of the results. Our approach of using TW and sea surface temperature (SST) observations as guidance for future TW projections offers a different line of evidence from previous research that used coupled or regional models without explicitly including historical station data.\n Our survey of the climate record from station data reveals many global TW exceedances of 31\u00b0 and 33\u00b0C and two stations that have already reported multiple daily maximum TW values above 35\u00b0C. These conditions, nearing or beyond prolonged human physiological tolerance, have mostly occurred only for 1- to 2-hours\u2019 duration (fig. S2). They are concentrated in South Asia, the coastal Middle East, and coastal southwest North America, in close proximity to extraordinarily high SSTs and intense continental heat that together favor the occurrence of extreme humid heat (  2,   14). Along coastlines, the marine influence is manifest via anomalous onshore low-level winds during midday and afternoon hours, and these wind shifts can cause rapid dew point temperature (Td) increases in arid and semiarid coastal areas (figs. S3 to S9). Regionally coherent observational evidence supports these intense values: Of the stations along the Persian Gulf coastline with at least 50% data availability over 1979 to 2017, all have a historical 99.9th percentile of TW (the value exceeded roughly 14 times in 39 years) above 31\u00b0C ( Fig. 1; see fig. S1 for the all-time maximum). In the ERA-Interim reanalysis, the highest values are similarly located over the Persian Gulf and immediately adjacent land areas, as well as parts of the Indus River Valley (fig. S10). The spatiotemporal averaging inherent in reanalysis products causes ERA-Interim to be unable to represent the short durations and small areas of critical heat stress, causing its extreme TW values to be substantially lower than those of weather stations across the tropics and subtropics (fig. S11). In the Persian Gulf and adjacent Gulf of Oman, these differences are consistently in the range of \u22122\u00b0 to \u22124\u00b0C (fig. S12). Larger bias but similar consistency is present along the eastern shore of the Red Sea, presenting a basis for future studies examining the reasons for this behavior, as well as further comparisons between station and reanalysis data.\n  Other &gt;31\u00b0C hotspots in the weather station record emerge through surveying the globally highest 99.9th TW percentiles: eastern coastal India, Pakistan and northwestern India, and the shores of the Red Sea, Gulf of California, and southern Gulf of Mexico ( Fig. 1). All are situated in the subtropics, along coastlines (typically of a semienclosed gulf or bay of shallow depth, limiting ocean circulation and promoting high SSTs), and in proximity to sources of continental heat, which together with the maritime air comprise the necessary combination for the most exceptional TW (  11). That subtropical coastlines are hotspots for heat stress has been noted previously (  23,   24); our analysis makes clear the broad geographic scope but also the large intraregional variations ( Fig. 1). Western South Asia stands as the main exception to this coastline rule, likely due to the efficient inland transport of humid air by the summer monsoon together with large-scale irrigation (  15,   25). Tropical forest and oceanic areas generally experience TW no higher than 31\u00b0 to 32\u00b0C, perhaps a consequence of the high evapotranspiration potential and cloud cover, along with the greater instability of the tropical atmosphere. However, more research is needed on the thermodynamic mechanisms that prevent these areas from attaining higher values.\n Steep and statistically significant upward trends in extreme TW frequency (exceedances of 27\u00b0, 29\u00b0, 31\u00b0, and 33\u00b0C) and magnitude are present across weather stations globally ( Fig. 2). Each frequency trend represents more than a doubling of occurrences of the corresponding threshold between 1979 and 2017. Trends in ERA-Interim are strongly correlated with those of HadISD but are smaller for the highest values ( Fig. 2), consistent with ERA-Interim\u2019s underestimation of extreme TW that is largest for the most extreme conditions (fig. S11). We also find a sharp peak in the number of global TW = 27\u00b0C and TW = 29\u00b0C extremes during the strong El Ni\u00f1o events of 1998 and 2016. Linearly detrending this global-TW-extremes time series reveals that the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) correlation is largest for TW values that are high but not unusual (~27\u00b0 to 28\u00b0C) across the tropics and subtropics (fig. S13). Further work is necessary to test to what extent this relationship may be related to the effect of ENSO on hydrological extremes at the global scale, on tropospheric-mean temperatures, or on SSTs in particular basins, and the implications of these effects for TW predictability (  26,   27). Overall, TW extremes in the tropics largely correspond on an interannual basis to mean TW (fig. S14), indicating that climate forcings and modes of internal variability resulting in mean temperature shifts can be expected to modulate tropical TW extremes. This is the case in the subtropics as well, although to a somewhat lesser extent.\n  We also observe modulation on a seasonal scale, by considering as an illustrative example the South Asian monsoon region. There, the timing of peak TW varies with the advance of the summer monsoon (  15). Splitting South Asia into \u201cearly monsoon\u201d and \u201clate monsoon\u201d subregions, we find that the number of TW extremes is largest around the time of the local climatological monsoon onset date ( Fig. 3). Although equivalent extreme values of TW are possible before, during, and after the monsoon rains in any given year, they are of a different character; especially in the northern and western parts of the subcontinent, they become continually moister and have lower dry-bulb temperatures as summer progresses. Across the globe, such temperature and humidity variations occur within a well-defined bivariate space (fig. S15). That these variations are systematically associated with the summer monsoon in South Asia emphasizes the important role of moisture, and of weather systems on synoptic to subseasonal time scales, in controlling extreme TW (  15,   28). Our findings underscore the diversity of conditions that can lead to extreme humid heat in the same location at different times, suggesting that impacts adaptation strategies may benefit from taking this recognition into account. Such intraseasonal variability in TW also matters for physiological acclimation, which requires several-day time scales to develop (  29); TW character is especially relevant when considering effects on human systems that vary in their sensitivity to humidity and temperature\u2014for example, thermoregulation and energy demand for artificial cooling are strongly affected by TW, whereas the materials that make up the built environment are principally affected by temperature alone (  13,   30).\n  While our analysis of weather stations indicates that TW has already been reported as having exceeded 35\u00b0C in limited areas for short periods, this has not yet occurred at the regional scale represented by reanalysis data, which is also the approximate scale of model projections of future TW extremes considered in previous studies (  14,   15). To increase the comparability of our station findings with these model projections, we implement a generalized extreme value (GEV) analysis to estimate the amount of global warming from the preindustrial period until TW will regularly exceed 35\u00b0C at the global hottest ERA-Interim grid cells, currently all located in the Persian Gulf area ( Fig. 4). Complete details of this procedure are in Materials and Methods. In brief, we fit a nonstationary GEV model to the grid cells experiencing the highest TW values, with the GEV location parameter a function of the annual global-mean air-temperature anomaly. This enables us to quantify how much global warming is required for annual maximum TW \u2265 35\u00b0C to become at most a 1-in-30-year event at any grid cell. We conduct this analysis solely for grid cells where the nonstationary GEV model is a significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) better fit to the annual maximum time series (1979\u20132017) than a stationary alternative. We then define the temperature of emergence (ToE) as the amount of global warming required until TW \u226535\u00b0C is at most a 1-in-30-year event at the ERA-Interim spatiotemporal scale, such that the lowest ToE at any grid cell approximates the first occurrences of TW = 35\u00b0C that are widespread and sustained enough to cause serious or fatal health impacts, as estimated from physiological studies (  6,   10,   31).\n  Our method yields a ToE of 1.3\u00b0C over the waters of the Persian Gulf (90% confidence interval, 0.81\u00b0 to 1.73\u00b0C) and of 2.3\u00b0C for nearby land grid cells (1.4\u00b0 to 3.3\u00b0C) ( Fig. 4). Adjusting these numbers for ERA-Interim\u2019s robust Persian Gulf differences of approximately \u22123\u00b0C for extreme TW (fig. S12) supports the conclusion from the station observations that recent warming has increased exceedances of TW = 35\u00b0C, but that this threshold has most likely been achieved on occasion throughout the observational record ( Fig. 2). The strong marine influence on these values is also apparent in  Fig. 1.\n To further assess the physical realism of our GEV extrapolation, we additionally examine observed annual maximum (monthly mean) SSTs. An atmospheric boundary layer fully equilibrated with the ocean surface would be at saturation and have the same temperature as the underlying SSTs, meaning that, in principle, 35\u00b0C is the lowest SST that could sustain the critical 35\u00b0C value of TW in the air above. In reality, equilibrium will not be achieved if air-mass residence times over extreme SSTs are too short, which is more likely if the vertical profile of the atmosphere allows strong surface heating to trigger deep convection (  10). Current large-scale SSTs and their trends may therefore provide some guidance as to whether our projections of extreme TW are physically plausible. It is in this context that we note monthly mean SSTs exceeding the 35\u00b0C threshold for the first time, reaching 35.2\u00b0C in the Persian Gulf in 2017 ( Fig. 5). As a result, our GEV projection of large-scale maritime TW \u2265 35\u00b0C, for less than 1.5\u00b0C warming, appears physically consistent with SST observations at the same scale. Analogous corroboration of station-based TW \u2265 35\u00b0C events is provided by point scale, hourly SST and TW across the Persian Gulf from an independent database of marine observations (see the Supplementary Materials) (  21), in which we find SSTs have exceeded 35\u00b0C in every year since 1979, with ~33% of July to September 2017 observations above this threshold. During the summer of 2017, reports of Persian Gulf over-water TW \u2265 35\u00b0C also peaked at ~6% of all TW measurements there.\n The station-based approach that we take here and the model-based approach taken in previous studies (  14\u2013  16) represent different methods for obtaining valuable perspective on the genesis and characteristics of global TW extremes. The primary strength of station data is its ability to precisely capture local conditions, but even the best-available station data have limitations, uncertainties, and potential unobserved humidity biases (for example, due to observational procedures, instrumentation type, or siting), as well as highly incomplete spatial coverage (see discussion in the Supplementary Materials) (  32,   33). In contrast, reanalysis products and high-resolution regional models satisfy the need for spatiotemporal continuity and consistency and allow analysis of additional variables, but often underestimate extremes (  34).\n In this study, we demonstrate that efforts to better understand extreme TW would benefit from further close examination, and improved standardization and integration, of station data to alleviate model shortcomings\u2014especially along coasts where TW can vary markedly over small distances and where high-quality humidity data are therefore essential\u2014but that station-based and physical modeling\u2013based approaches are fundamentally complementary. Further research into the origins of extreme-TW biases in gridded products and continued advances in data assimilation would also help enable the development of a more unified approach drawing on all available sources of knowledge. For instance, it is important to understand the treatment of extreme values in reanalyses, and whether false-positive or false-negative rejections might be taking place, particularly as temperature and humidity distributions shift toward ever-higher values. Key multiscale TW processes necessitating closer comparison between observations and models include coastal upwelling, atmospheric convection, land-atmosphere interactions, and atmospheric variability linked to SSTs (  28)\u2014for instance, at the hourly, 1- to 10-km scale. Detailed analyses of individual events could help illuminate the unfolding interactions of processes and provide additional investigative power, such as in tracing and forecasting the rapid increases in humidity, which tend to accompany TW extremes (fig. S5), and in assessing the role of topography and land use/land cover in creating apparent TW hotspots (fig. S4). Studies comparing biases and trends in TW and SSTs among reanalyses, models, and regions would be especially beneficial, as would investigation of the sensitivity of extreme-TW projections to historical variability, changes in forcing patterns, and statistical methodologies.\n Imminent severe humid heat provides incentive for a broad interdisciplinary research initiative to better characterize health impacts. Increased collection of high-resolution health data, international collaborations with public health experts and social scientists, and dedicated modeling projects would aid in answering questions about how vulnerable populations (such as the elderly, outdoor laborers, and those with preexisting health conditions) will be adversely affected as peak TW advances further into the extreme ranges we consider here. Of particular salience is the need to ascertain how acclimation to high-heat-stress conditions is diminished as the physiological survivability limit is approached. Such efforts may also help resolve the reasons for the paucity of reported mortality and morbidity impacts associated with observed near 35\u00b0C conditions (  11,   14).\n Our findings indicate that reported occurrences of extreme TW have increased rapidly at weather stations and in reanalysis data over the last four decades and that parts of the subtropics are very close to the 35\u00b0C survivability limit, which has likely already been reached over both sea and land. These trends highlight the magnitude of the changes that have taken place as a result of the global warming to date. At the spatial scale of reanalysis, we project that TW will regularly exceed 35\u00b0C at land grid points with less than 2.5\u00b0C of warming since preindustrial\u2014a level that may be reached in the next several decades (  35). According to our weather station analysis, emphasizing land grid points underplays the true risks of extreme TW along coastlines, which tends to occur when marine air masses are advected even slightly onshore (  14). The southern Persian Gulf shoreline and northern South Asia are home to millions of people, situating them on the front lines of exposure to TW extremes at the edge of and outside the range of natural variability in which our physiology evolved (  36). The deadly heat events already experienced in recent decades are indicative of the continuing trend toward increasingly extreme humid heat, and our findings underline that their diverse, consequential, and growing impacts represent a major societal challenge for the coming decades.\n We use HadISD, version 2.0.1.2017f, which is produced by the Met Office Hadley Centre as a more rigorously quality-controlled version of the National Climatic Data Center Integrated Surface Database (ISD) (  17,   18). HadISD results from the implementation of additional data availability and quality control procedures to ISD, including checks on both temperature and Td, the two variables required for computing TW.

"note_en": "In order to prove to a client that a change of their indexed collection of complex numbers from an array of structures (with a real part and an imaginary part) to a structure of arrays, I created a simplified version of their hotspot code for computing the sum of squared differences. At its most basic, this was a for-loop that takes two equal-sized vectors of complex values, computes the difference of corresponding real values and the difference of corresponding imaginary values, squares the two computed differences, adds the two differences together and then adds that sum to a running total.\n To illustrate the point I was trying to make, I implemented the for-loop computation with the client\u2019s original array of complex  structs and then added another version of the computational loop, but with a structure that held an array of real and an array of imaginary values. In both cases I was using double-precision floating point values in my C++ code. As expected, due to the better layout of data, my structure of arrays method did measurably better than the original data structure. Wanting to go a bit further, I compiled my example to use the AVX vectorization. Those results were an even better argument for the change of data structure.\n Thinking to push myself, I decided to write another version of the two tests using AVX vector intrinsics in my source code. I realized that the heart of the computation was pretty simple: copy data to vector registers, duplicate and permute vector register contents, do a couple multiplications and some additions. I knew all these operations were supported, so I went to the online  Intel Intrinsics Guide page to figure out exactly what intrinsics would be needed. Choosing the technology supported by my target system and selecting categories of operations, I quickly scoped out all the intrinsic statements I needed. That is, until I came up against the realization that I would need a reduction operation to make the final addition of the separate summations within the final vector register.\n What could be easier? I mean, reduction is a basic operation in parallel computation, right? OpenMP and Intel Threading Building Blocks both have built-in reduction operations and half of Chapter 6 in The Art of Concurrency describes how to implement parallel sum (reduction). Heeding the advice in the latter (and being the lazy programmer that I am), I went in search of an online example code. I presumed someone somewhere must have already coded up a vector intrinsic version of reduction.\u00a0 After 20 minutes with Google, I hadn\u2019t found anything even close. Thus, I turned back to the Intel Intrinsics Guide and knuckled down to write one myself.\n In order to prevent any stress to my reader due to prolonged anticipation, here is my stand-alone implementation of the algorithm I devised to do a reduction of 4 double-precision values within an AVX vector register and print out the final answer (just to check results and show it was done correctly). There are four steps in the algorithm that will take the values in the  ymm0 vector variable, sum up the four double-precision values, and leave that sum in each of the four elements of the final vector variable ( ymm4). After the full code I will describe each of the four algorithmic steps and intrinsics used in more detail.\n #include &lt;iostream&gt;// get AVX intrinsics#include &lt;immintrin.h&gt;double\u00a0 indata[4] = {2.0, 3.0f, 2.0f, 5.0f};double outdata[4] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0};__m256d ymm0, ymm1, ymm2, ymm3, ymm4;int main(){\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ymm0 = _mm256_loadu_pd(indata);\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ymm1 = _mm256_permute_pd(ymm0, 0x05);\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ymm2 = _mm256_add_pd(ymm0, ymm1);\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ymm3 = _mm256_permute2f128_pd(ymm2, ymm2, 0x01);\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ymm4 = _mm256_add_pd(ymm2, ymm3);\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 _mm256_storeu_pd(outdata, ymm4);\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Out vector: &#34; &lt;&lt; outdata[0] &lt;&lt; &#34; &#34; &lt;&lt; outdata[1] &lt;&lt; &#34; &#34; &lt;&lt;\u00a0outdata[2] &lt;&lt; &#34; &#34; &lt;&lt; outdata[3] &lt;&lt; std::endl;}\n To help in the description, since I myself am a visual learner, I have put together an illustration of the contents of the vector variables at each phase of the reduction algorithm that will assist in showing the operation of each of the AVX intrinsics. Just for the sake of doing something different and interesting I will be using Pai Gow dominoes to represent the four values within the AVX vector registers. For my purposes I will ignore the configuration of dots, the color of the dots, the name of the tiles, and I hope you can, too. Simply count the number of spots on each of the tiles to determine the value within each part of the vector. (My code is using double-precision floating point values while the illustrative dominoes have an integral number of dots.)\n In the example code, I have loaded the data on which to perform the reduction into the  ymm0 variable. (Though I\u2019ve named these variables after the vector registers within the processor, there is no implied or explicit mapping of my names to the actual registers used within the compiled code. Also, rather than saying \u201cvector variable\u201d for these, I will call them \u201cregisters\u201d just to be less verbose.) To get started, the program simply loads the values of  indata into  ymm0. If this algorithm were incorporated in the sum of squared differences code that was driving this whole thing, this initial data would be the results of those vectorized computations. In any event, the data to be reduced starts in the  ymm0 register. Here\u2019s my illustration of initial data of 4 values:\n  The first instruction for the reduction is to copy the data within the  ymm0 register, permute the order of the vector elements and store this permutation in the  ymm1 register.\n  The first parameter is the source of the data,  ymm0, and the second is an integer bitmask to control how the elements from the source are permuted. The least significant bit (index [0]) specifies the source of the least significant element in the vector (bits 63:0), the second least significant bit in the mask (index [1]) specifies the next 64-bit element in the vector (bits 127:64), and so on for the upper two vector elements. A \u20180\u2019 in the least significant bit merely copies the current value of the least significant 64 bits into the destination; a \u20181\u2019 in this position will copy the second least significant element (bits 127:64) into the least significant destination vector element. For the second least significant bit in the mask, the opposite values will perform the same operations into the second destination vector element. That is, a \u20181\u2019 will copy the same value while a \u20180\u2019 will copy the least significant vector element. This instruction works with 128-bit lanes, so the upper half of the vector register elements will be permuted the same way (just add 128 to all the bit indices).\n (Now, if you followed my marginally tortuous explanation of the operation of this intrinsic, then you\u2019re a better reader than I am. For the rest of us, there is a picture below illustrating what will be stored in  ymm1, which will be worth at least 1000 less convoluted words. Either way, I suggest that you consult the Intel Intrinsics Guide for the official explanation of the instructions, the parameters, and the operation of all the intrinsics I\u2019m using.)\n For my reduction operation, the bit mask I used is \u20180101\u2019 (or 0x05 in hexadecimal). This will exchange the position of the values in the lower pair of vector elements and exchange the position of the values in the upper pair of vector elements. Compare the picture below with the picture in the figure above to see exactly how the elements end up in the  ymm1 register.\n    This is a pretty basic instruction taking two source registers ( ymm0,  ymm1), adding the corresponding elements, and storing the sums into the corresponding elements of the destination register. I\u2019ve illustrated this below with the two example source registers and what would be stored in the  ymm2 destination.\n  After the second operation, the reduction is halfway complete. From the illustration we can see that the sum of the two upper and the two lower halves of the original vector register have been summed and are duplicated in the two upper elements and two lower elements, respectively.\n To finish the reduction, I simply need to execute two similar operations: permute and add. The permutation, however, will need to copy 128-bits of vector data. This is done with the following intrinsic:\n  If you look up this instruction in the Intel Intrinsics Guide, you will notice that the first two parameters are (potentially) two different vector source registers. I\u2019ve used the same register here since I really only need to permute (or copy) data from a single source. As with the previous permutation instruction I\u2019ve used, the last parameter is a bitmask to control what gets copied to the destination register.\n From the documentation I was using, the bitmask uses eight bits with the lower nibble dictating what is copied to the lower 128 bits of the destination and the upper nibble controlling the value copied into the upper 128 bits of the 256-bit register. With two input sources, there are 4 possibilities from where to copy 128-bit register contents: lower half (bits 127:0) of first source (\u20180\u2019), upper half (bits 255:128) of first source (\u20181\u2019), lower half of second source (\u20182\u2019), and upper half of second source (\u20183\u2019).\n One thing I found confusing when researching this intrinsic in the Intrinsics Guide is that while the bitmasks are used 4-bits at a time, only 2 bits are used to determine which of the four sources of data are to be copied. When specifying the bitmask, it would appear that a binary value of \u20180001\u2019 will be treated the same as \u20181101\u2019 since the two uppermost bits appear to be thrown out. The operation code shown on the site would imply that this is the case. (It isn\u2019t. If you\u2019re curious, I urge you to play around with the program above and the bitmask in the second permutation intrinsic.) For my purposes, I didn\u2019t need to worry about this since I was simply swapping the upper and lower 128-bit sections of the same source register,  ymm2, into the destination register.\n The example illustration below shows the source register,  ymm2, and the contents of the destination register,  ymm3, after this permutation instrinsic is executed. (Can you see that a bitmask of \u20180x21\u2019 in the above instruction would yield the same results?)\n  Finally, now that everything is lined up, a simple vector addition of the  ymm2 and  ymm3 registers will complete the reduction of the values from the original vector register.\n    And that\u2019s all there is for doing a sum reduction on the four double-precision elements from an AVX 256-bit vector register. The last couple of instructions from the full code example copy the four results values from the final vector register and then print them out for confirmation of the correct answer.\n Can this algorithm be done with different data types and under different vector technologies? I haven\u2019t looked at the general problem in too much detail, but if there are a set of appropriate permutation intrinsics available, it should be possible to construct a similar reduction algorithm for different sizes and types of data.\n Now you might be wondering whether or not the effort I put into researching intrinsics, decoding the operation details, and trying different combinations of parameters and bit masks until I figured out the right formula was worth it all. Sadly, not really. Comparing my hand-coded vectorization of the sum of squared differences, including the four-step reduction, to the compiler generated vectorization of the simple for-loop code version, there was a very slim margin of better performance from my hand-coded vectorization. This tells me that someone working on the compiler has probably already figured out something similar to what I have described above. The lesson here just reinforces the adage about  letting the compiler find and transform your source code into vectorized code with the programmer giving hints or small rewrites as needed.\n All in all, the whole exercise does have a silver lining. I\u2019m thinking that, with this publication, it might be the first (and only) place on the web where a Google search for \u201cvectorized reduction\u201d will yield a tangible algorithm. I doubt anyone will be beating down my door to get this, though.

Over 16 million pages of historicAmerican newspapers have been digitized for Chronicling America to date,complete with high-resolution images and machine-readable METS/ALTO OCR. Ofconsiderable interest to Chronicling America users is a semantified corpus,complete with extracted visual content and headlines. To accomplish this, weintroduce a visual content recognition model trained on bounding boxannotations of photographs, illustrations, maps, comics, and editorial cartoonscollected as part of the Library of Congress&#39;s Beyond Words crowdsourcinginitiative and augmented with additional annotations including those ofheadlines and advertisements. We describe our pipeline that utilizes this deeplearning model to extract 7 classes of visual content: headlines, photographs,illustrations, maps, comics, editorial cartoons, and advertisements, completewith textual content such as captions derived from the METS/ALTO OCR, as wellas image embeddings for fast image similarity querying. We report the resultsof running the pipeline on 16.3 million pages from the Chronicling Americacorpus and describe the resulting Newspaper Navigator dataset, the largestdataset of extracted visual content from historic newspapers ever produced.

"note_en": "SINGAPORE - A four-legged robot will be patrolling Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park to remind people of safe distancing measures starting from Friday (May 8).\n Called Spot, the robot will assist with safe distancing efforts at parks, gardens and nature reserves managed by National Parks Board (NParks) and at parks managed by town councils.\n The pilot trial is jointly conducted by NParks, and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG).\n  The Spot robot will broadcast a recorded message reminding park visitors to observe safe distancing measures.\n It is fitted with cameras, enabled by GovTech-developed video analytics, to help it estimate the number of visitors in the parks.\n The cameras, however, will not be able to track or recognise specific individuals, neither will it collect any personal data.\n   As part of the two-week trial, Spot will be deployed over a 3km stretch in the River Plains section of the park during off-peak hours, and it will be accompanied by at least one NParks officer.\n If the trial proves successful, NParks will consider deploying Spot for safe distancing efforts at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park in the morning and during evening peak-hours.\n NParks is also looking into deploying the robot at other parks such as Jurong Lake Gardens.\n Originally developed by American company Boston Dynamics, the four-legged robot is able to navigate obstacles more effectively compared to wheeled robots, making it suitable for different terrains.\n  It is also fitted with safety sensors to detect objects and people within 1m to avoid collision.\n   GovTech has enhanced Spot with various functions such as remote control, 3D-mapping and semi-autonomous operations to facilitate the trial.\n It is currently looking to develop analytics allowing Spot to check if park visitors are observing safe distancing measures.\n  As it is\u00a0controlled remotely, less manpower is needed for park patrols, helping to minimise physical contact among staff, safe distancing ambassadors and park visitors. This helps to lower their risk of exposure to the Covid-19 virus.\n   NParks is also deploying 30 drones to detect visitorship at selected parks and nature areas.\n In addition, the Safe Distance At Parks portal lets the public find parks near them, as well as check the crowd situation at the parks before making their way there.\n The Spot robot is also currently on trial at the Changi Exhibition Centre community isolation facility, which houses patients with mild symptoms, to help deliver essential items such as medicine to patients.\n  The SNDGG will also be exploring the use of the robot in supporting other Covid-19-related operations across agencies.\n    The four-wheeled robot was originally used for surveillance, but it now broadcasts safe distancing messages at the park as it patrols the area in the mornings and the evenings when human traffic is at its highest.", "posttime": "2020-05-09 13:48:11", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "The COVID-19 crisis provides the most visible evidence yet that reducing automobile use in Los Angeles would drastically improve the region\u2019s  air quality.\n  Longer term,  C alifornia must cut down on vehicle travel in order to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions and stave off climate change.\n Contrary to what one might expect, the biggest challenge in Southern California is not necessarily infrastructure (although America\u2019s high  subway construction costs impede development) but land use.\n Limited housing development, particularly in jobs-rich areas like the Westside, has led to rising home prices, displacing low- and mid-income households to the suburban periphery. This forces populations that might have once relied on active or public transportation to buy automobiles and commute long distances to work.\n The current development  dynamics in Los Angeles concentrate density in Downtown and surrounding Eastside neighborhoods. This strategy is partly the result of staunch opposition to development from inner suburban homeowners. But it also reflects a business and political leadership\u2019s desire to  copy the East Coast (i.e. Manhattan) by centering the poly-centric metropolis around a high-rise \u201ccore.\u201d\n  As I have  written previously, this focus on \u201cre-developing\u201d the inner city encourages the very gentrification that up-zoning should combat. It also fails to develop enough to make a dent in housing prices.\n Rather than try to recreate the 19th-century cities of East Coast or Europe, Los Angeles should build out like the twentieth- and twenty-first mega-cities of East Asia.\n  The mid- to high-dense, amorphous sprawl of Seoul and Tokyo more closely matches the urban development pattern of Los Angeles than the ordered core-and-periphery pattern of Chicago, New York or London.\n Developing housing and transit along East Asian lines would result in higher transit use, lower emissions and a more vibrant economy. It would also counteract a longstanding tradition of marginalizing East Asia in policy discussions.\n I know a lot more about urban policy than I do about public health, so one thing I\u2019ll say about the masks is American officials have long seemed fanatically opposed to the idea of learning anything about housing policy or transit from developed Asia.\n\u2014 Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias)  March 28, 2020\n   Both Seoul and LA\u2019s urbanized areas cover a broad swath of territory. Greater Los Angeles extends for more than 130 miles\u2013from Ventura to Temecula. The  Seoul Capital Area, which incorporates Gyeonggi Province and the independent cities of Seoul and Incheon, encompasses more than 12 percent of South Korea\u2019s landmass.\n  Seoul sprawls densely. Travel 18 miles west of Seoul\u2019s Central Business District, to Incheon\u2019s Seongnam-Dong neighborhood, and you\u2019ll still find yourself in a compact urban setting.\n  The neighborhood\u2019s narrow streets, moderately-tall buildings (relative to the street) and diverse street-fronting land uses, make the area easily accessible by foot.\n Los Angeles is frequently derided as \u201cone giant suburb.\u201d But its expansive suburbs are quite built up.\n  Travel 18 miles south of Downtown Los Angeles, to north-central Long Beach and you\u2019re still in a neighborhood of small parcels and tight street grids. Development intensities are lower than in Seoul but higher than in the stereotypical suburb. On the residential streets, two to three story apartment buildings alternate with single-family homes. Pacific Coast Highway\u2019s auto shops and strip malls leave a lot to be desired but some of the north-south streets like Pacific Avenue have more street-fronting retail.\n  By contrast, traveling 18 miles east of Midtown Manhattan brings you to Long Island\u2019s Garden City, an almost exclusively residential area, dominated by single-family homes on spacious lots.\n    The Euro-Atlantic core-periphery development model contains density within an envelope that both LA and Seoul greatly exceed.\n As in LA, both jobs and population have dispersed in Seoul in recent years. As early as 1997, suburbs like Incheon and Suwon rivaled the central area of Seoul in employment.\n  Except Seoul\u2019s suburban density is denser and more walkable than LA\u2019s.\n  I will get more into the specifics of what LA can do in a future article. Some general pointers:\n The streets are narrower, making it more difficult to drive (since the streets can\u2019t accommodate \u201cpeak period\u201d vehicle congestion) and easier to cross the street.\n The buildings are taller, more tightly spaced and more mixed-use in nature, reducing walking distances between different activity points.  Note: LA\u2019s zoning laws prohibit this!\n The rapid transit system (subway+commuter rail) is more extensive, with a less radial focus. Seongnam-do is served by a subway line running on a north-south axis through Incheon. This connects with both the employment centers by the port of Incheon (to the south) and an east/west line (to the north) connecting to Downtown Seoul. LA, by contrast, follows the Chicago/New York model of routing rail (and many bus) lines to converge on Downtown.\n    Private cars only have a  23.5 percent mode share in Seoul, compared to a  70 percent mode share in LA. Almost 40 percent of Seoul-ites travel by subway and another 28 percent travel by bus.\n  On the other hand, the average cost for a studio in a \u201cnormal\u201d neighborhood in Seoul is only  537 dollars.", "posttime": "2020-05-09 11:11:18", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5e94\u8be5,la,\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6", "title": "\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u5e94\u8be5\u5982\u4f55\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\uff1f\u628a\u76ee\u5149\u6295\u5411\u9996\u5c14", "title_en": "How should LA urbanize?

We know that testing has been inadequate, and that many cases of the disease are mild or even asymptomatic, making them less likely to be detected. So how many cases have slipped under the radar?\n  One way to find out the true prevalence of the disease is to test random samples of the population using a blood test that detects antibodies produced by the immune system against the virus. This is different from the swab tests that have been used worldwide throughout the pandemic, which detect the genetic material of the virus itself.\n  Blood tests, which require just a pinprick, can be done at the point of care, and so are faster and easier to process than the swab tests, where samples need to be shipped to a lab. Blood tests are also helpful because the prevalence of the disease can be assessed from a larger population, which can include people who have recovered from the disease, as the antibodies it detects remain in the blood even after recovery. However, because antibodies take several days after infection to be produced, these tests cannot replace swab tests for the very important purpose of detecting new cases of the illness before it can be spread to others.\n  Much of the attention on antibody tests has focused on how they can help us estimate just how deadly Covid-19 really is by giving us a better sense of the total number of infected people, and thus of the true rate of infected people who died. If the number of infected people is much larger than expected because there are many undiagnosed infections, that means the probability of dying from an infection is much lower than it would be if we looked only at the number of diagnosed cases. Some  have hoped that antibody tests could show us that the virus \u201cisn\u2019t as deadly as we thought,\u201d and may therefore inform \u201cbetter policy decisions\u201d about restrictive social distancing policies.\n  The Santa Clara Study  There have been several recent attempts to use these blood tests to determine the prevalence of the disease, and with it its true fatality rate. One that has garnered a great deal of attention has been a  study conducted by Stanford researchers in Santa Clara County, the metropolitan region around Silicon Valley. By taking blood tests on subjects recruited from a Facebook survey, researchers estimated the prevalence of infection in the community to be much higher \u2014 and the fatality rate to be much lower \u2014 than confirmed diagnoses would indicate.\n  In the initial preprint version of the paper from April 17, they estimated that between 2.5 and 4.1 percent of the county had been infected, 50 to 85 times the roughly 1,000 cases that had been diagnosed at the time. Based on those numbers, they estimated the infection fatality rate of the disease to be between 0.12 and 0.2 percent, far lower than the roughly 5 percent fatality rate for diagnosed cases in the United States, and not much higher than the 0.1 percent fatality rate  for seasonal influenza.\n  The study was  widely  criticized  at the time, and although the researchers published a revised version of the paper addressing some of these criticisms on April 30, their topline results have not changed much: Their estimate for the prevalence of the disease in Santa Clara County is now between 1.3 and 4.7 percent (extending their earlier range), while their estimate for the infection fatality rate is now 0.17 percent (within their earlier range).\n  Criticisms of the paper centered on two major weaknesses. First, the authors reported a relatively high false positive rate, which is particularly problematic in a place like Santa Clara that has not seen a major outbreak. Second, critics voiced concerns that people who suspected they may have had undiagnosed coronavirus infections may have been more likely to participate in the survey, biasing the results. Let\u2019s look at each of these in turn, and at how the researchers responded to these concerns in their revised paper.\n  The researchers originally reported that the lab tests they ran to try to validate their test kits prior to use had a 0.5 percent false positive rate. This may not seem like much. But in their actual survey, just 1.5 percent of tests came back positive. (Their higher final prevalence estimate was made by adjusting for demographic factors in their sample.) This would suggest that a third of their positive results may have been erroneous. But 0.5 percent is just a \u201cpoint estimate\u201d of their false positive rate, based on how many errors they observed in the limited number of validation tests they performed, and the actual false positive rate could be higher or lower.\n  Critics  argued that it\u2019s statistically plausible that the false positive rate could have been even higher than the number of positive results the researchers found. This would mean that the positive results they found would be consistent with there being zero true positive cases. Of course, no one believed that there were literally no true positive cases of coronavirus in Santa Clara County. But when the false positive rate is statistically compatible with the number of positive results detected, this casts doubt on the quality of the evidence provided by the test.\n  In their updated paper, however, the authors ran a larger number of tests to validate the performance of their kits to provide a more precise estimate of the false positive rate; their point estimate for the false positive rate is still 0.5 percent, but with an upper bound of just 0.8 percent and a lower bound of 0.3 percent, which can give us greater confidence of the accuracy of their results.\n  The second area of concern is about sample bias in the volunteers that participated in the study. The subjects were recruited through a Facebook survey, and then drove to testing sites. It is plausible that many of those who decided to volunteer for a free coronavirus test were people who had some suspicion that they had already had the illness without being tested. In the updated draft of the paper, the authors report that 3 percent of their subjects had experienced cough and fever within the past two weeks, while 20 percent had symptoms within the past two months, and that those who reported symptoms were more likely to receive positive antibody tests than those who did not.\n  The authors speculate that \u201cthe proportion of participants with cough + fever may actually be lower than what is typical in California, and, if so, the bias in the estimation of prevalence may be even in the opposite direction.\u201d But they give no indication of what is the typical proportion of the Californian population who report symptoms of fever and cough. Their source for the claim is the  CDC\u2019s map of the historical levels of influenza-like illness across the country, but that map only reports relative levels, from \u201cminimal\u201d to \u201cvery high,\u201d rather than the numeric prevalence of the illness. And the underlying data for that map from the  California Department of Health is based on flu hospitalization rates rather than the total number of people with flu-like symptoms. That being said, it is not clear how much of an effect this sample bias may have had on their estimates.\n  In their updated paper, the Stanford researchers have addressed some of the more important criticisms of their initial estimates of the prevalence of Covid-19 in Santa Clara. However, their finding about the total infection fatality rate remains difficult to square with the observed death rates in New York.\n  New York Sanity Check  According to the  New York City Department of Health, as of two days ago, there have been 13,938 confirmed Covid-19 deaths, with an additional 5,359 probable deaths. The city\u2019s population is about  8.6 million, meaning that if we only include confirmed deaths then 0.16 percent of the entire city has already died from the virus (or 0.22 percent if we include probable deaths). If the infection fatality rate for the virus were really just 0.17 percent, as the Santa Clara study estimated, that would imply that  virtually the entire city has already been infected. This is hardly plausible, both because herd immunity would likely stop transmission before everyone in a region is infected, and because antibody tests in the city in fact show much lower rates (on which more below).\n  If we include probable deaths, and assumed that every single New York City resident has indeed been infected, then the fatality rate could not be as low as 0.17 percent. (This is not to mention that Covid-19 deaths are most likely undercounted. In New York City alone, between March 11 and May 2,  an additional 4,300 people have died over and above expected levels.)\n  The Stanford researchers acknowledge this wrinkle in their finding in the updated version of their paper by noting that the fatality rate may be \u201csubstantially higher in places where the hospitals are overwhelmed\u201d or \u201cwhere infections are concentrated among vulnerable individuals.\u201d This points to the limits of ascertaining infection fatality rates from regions with a low prevalence of the disease. It also suggests that decisions about relaxing efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus should not be based on serological tests only from areas that did not see a large outbreak, since relaxation of mitigation efforts could lead to larger outbreaks with not only higher total numbers of deaths, but also higher death rates for those infected.\n  If we want to get a better sense of the fatality rate for the virus, we should look instead to hard hit regions like New York. The state has been conducting a large serosurvey of its own. The survey is ongoing and details have not yet been published. But according to an  announcement from Governor Cuomo on April 27, at which point 7,500 people had been tested, nearly 25 percent of New York City, and nearly 15 percent statewide were found to have antibodies against the virus.\n  To select samples, the state set up testing sites in public areas like supermarkets, which might mitigate the self-selection bias in the Facebook-survey method used by the Stanford researchers. On the other hand, people who are walking around in public may be a higher risk group than those who are scrupulously self-isolating.\n  Details about the accuracy of the test are also limited: one  document indicates that the specificity of the test ranges between 93 and 100 percent, which means that as many as 7 percent of the positive results could be errors.  But because the actual prevalence of the disease is so much higher in New York than in Santa Clara, such false positives don\u2019t make as much of a difference to the validity of the results. Because there are so few people with antibodies in Santa Clara (roughly between 1 and 5 percent), most of the positive findings in a test with a relatively low false positive rate might well be errors. But in New York, which clearly has had many more infections, we can expect that false positives won\u2019t come close to outnumbering accurate positive findings.\n  The prevalence estimates from the survey in New York suggest that there have been about 10 times as many infections as regular diagnostic testing has found. This wouldn\u2019t be terribly unrealistic, given the shortages of tests in the state, a third of which  have come back positive. These estimates would put the infection fatality rate at 0.69 percent for the state or 0.66 percent for New York City. This would be far better than the fatality rate for confirmed cases (roughly 6 percent for the state), but would still be high enough to be very worrying: If we were to allow, say, half the country to be infected, then that fatality rate would result in over a million deaths.\n  Beyond Fatality Rates  While estimates of the infection fatality rate of Covid-19 obviously hold a grim fascination, they are not the most important thing we can garner from antibody studies. As the discrepancies between the fatality rate estimates in the Santa Clara and New York studies show, surveys in different regions at different stages of their outbreaks may lead to very different results. More importantly, there is not much we can do with information about the infection fatality rate.\n  What difference does a fraction of a percentage point in the rate make to the actions we need to take to control the pandemic today? Do we open up malls at a 0.5 percent fatality rate, and wait until a study comes along that shows a 0.3 percent rate before we open hair salons? These estimates don\u2019t tell us anything about how to make malls and hair salons safe to visit again, they merely tell us that we might not have to worry about doing so. They are tools for managing perceptions, not for managing the crisis itself.\n  One potentially useful application of antibody tests could be in identifying people who have been exposed to the virus and are now immune, who can then work in higher-risk settings. Such \u201c immunity passports\u201d are controversial, not least because we still do not know with certainty whether, or for how long, the presence of particular antibodies against the virus will confer immunity. And of course the idea of issuing immunity passports raises a host of ethical and social issues \u2014 from discrimination against those lacking immunity to the perverse incentive they may create for people to seek out infection to acquire immunity. But as antibody testing improves we will need to decide whether as a society we want to use the tests to issue immunity passports, and how we might do so in a way that does more good than harm.\n  Another more immediate use of antibody testing could be finding recovered patients to serve as donors of antibody-rich blood serum, so-called \u201cconvalescent plasma\u201d or \u201cconvalescent serum,\u201d which some  scientists have argued could be used to treat the disease or to confer short-term immunity to the virus for high-risk workers. Data from clinical trials of the treatment  will be available soon, but  early  reports from its use in severely ill patients are promising, and the idea has a century-old track record of safety and efficacy for treating infectious diseases. However, finding recovered patients who are eligible and available to donate can be a logistical challenge, and each donor can provide only enough serum for  treating 2 or 3 patients, so its usefulness is limited by the number of prospective donors we can identify.\n  As of this writing, we know of only about  195,000 recovered patients in the United States \u2014 about one for every six currently ill patients \u2014 so finding large numbers of recovered patients through antibody testing could allow for this treatment to become more widely available for those who need it the most. The simple tests used in these surveys may not be enough to determine if people have sufficient levels of antibody in their blood to serve as donors, but it could at least help identify prospective donors who could receive follow-up tests to determine their eligibility. As long as there are millions of unidentified people who have recovered from Covid-19, we should not allow a shortage of donors to hold back the availability of convalescent plasma therapy.\n  The findings from antibody studies remain uncertain and we will need more of them and more and better conventional testing to get a clearer sense of the true prevalence of the coronavirus epidemic in the United States. While we wait for such research, we should prepare to take advantage of the knowledge we might gain from it while continuing to build up our capacity to control the disease\u2019s spread. Because whatever we learn from these studies, the cost of letting the disease spread unchecked would be unacceptably high.", "posttime": "2020-05-09 11:10:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u75c5\u6bd2,rate,\u53ef\u80fd", "title": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e89\u8bba\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u7684\u81f4\u6b7b\u7387\u662f\u6beb\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u7684\uff1f", "title_en": "Why fighting about Covid-19\u2019s fatality rate is pointless", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/not-as-deadly-as-we-thought", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u75c5\u6bd2", "rate", "\u53ef\u80fd"]}]
