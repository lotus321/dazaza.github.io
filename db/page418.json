"note_en": "I get that people are getting a bit of cabin fever and perhaps that&#39;s impacting people&#39;s outlook on the world, but a recent piece by David Rotman in the MIT Tech Review is truly bizarre. The title gets you straight to the premise:  Covid-19 has blown apart the myth of Silicon Valley innovation. Of course, even the paragraph that explains the thesis seems almost like a modern updating of the famous  &#34;what have the Romans ever done for us?&#34; scene from Monty Python&#39;s  Life of Brian:  ...\n Silicon Valley and big tech in general have been lame in responding to the crisis. Sure, they have given us Zoom to keep the fortunate among us working and Netflix to keep us sane; Amazon is a savior these days for those avoiding stores; iPads are in hot demand and Instacart is helping to keep many self-isolating people fed. But the pandemic has also revealed the limitations and impotence of the world \u2019s richest companies (and, we have been told, the most innovative place on earth) in the face of  ...\n Wait, what? That doesn&#39;t seem &#34;lame&#34; at all. That kinda seems central to keeping much of the world safe, sane, and connected. And the next paragraph seems equally ridiculous:\n Big tech doesn\u2019t build anything. It\u2019s not likely to give us vaccines or diagnostic tests. We don\u2019t even seem to know how to make a cotton swab. Those hoping the US could turn its dominant tech industry into a dynamo of innovation against the pandemic will be disappointed.\n Leaving aside the hilariously wrong &#34;big tech doesn&#39;t build anything,&#34; this paragraph reads like &#34;how dare pharmaceutical companies not build video conferencing software.&#34; Besides, tons of big tech companies are doing a lot (beyond the admitted list above) to help during the pandemic, including Google&#39;s and Apple&#39;s  efforts to help with contact tracing, and then, of course, there are plenty of examples of the big tech companies of Silicon Valley trying to do more to  ...\n   Basically, the entire premise of Rotman&#39;s article makes no sense at all, and he just keeps repeating it like if he says it enough, maybe people will believe him:\n The pandemic has made clear this festering problem: the US is no longer very good at coming up with new ideas and technologies relevant to our most basic needs.\n Except that we are -- as his own article makes clear. The fact that internet companies aren&#39;t magically creating vaccines isn&#39;t a condemnation of Silicon Valley innovation. I mean, at best, you could argue that it&#39;s a failure of big pharma innovation, but it seems a bit early to be saying that one way or another given that we&#39;re just a few months into this thing, and a bunch of innovations that are helping to rapidly create a vaccine, like genetic testing, have also developed  ...\n The only way Rotman supports his premise is to argue that software/internet companies are producing software/internet products, rather than manufacturing physical goods. But, again, that&#39;s like saying &#34;why doesn&#39;t Pfizer create videoconferencing software.&#34; It&#39;s not their business. And, perhaps Rotman should get out of Cambridge and come to Silicon Valley (well, post pandemic) to learn about how there&#39;a a  hardware renaissancehappening in Silicon Valley, in part thanks  ...\n The whole article reads like Rotman had a premise, and then wrote the article despite the near total lack of any actual evidence to support the premise. It&#39;s a bad look for MIT&#39;s Tech Review, but what good has MIT ever brought the world anyway?", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:45:26", "tags": "\u79d1\u6280,tech,companies", "title":

"note_en": "If the 1980s saw the advent of trickle-down economics, the 2020s are witnessing the dawn of flush-down economics. As the coronavirus crisis is making clear, Americans are becoming more dependent on freebies subsidized by venture capitalists and investors. If you \u2019re using Zoom for free, if you have a free subscription to Disney+, or if you \u2019re getting \u201cfree \u201ddelivery from DoorDash, then you are the beneficiary of flush-down economics. What was once the quaint over-spending by so-called unicorns,  ...\n So far, flush-down economics has been a barely noticeable lifestyle boost. It has manifested, for example, in random discounted rides from Lyft and Uber; it has meant an under-enforcement of account-sharing by streaming services like Netflix or Spotify. When retrospectives of the 2010s arrive, they \u2019ll inevitably play scenes of scooters clogging up city sidewalks. Pangs of nostalgia will greet Americans as they reminisce of the simpler, pre-coronavirus days when our biggest concern was Silicon Valley  ...\n The origin of this cash glut comes from the 2008 Recession when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero in a move to stimulate the economy. At that point, the government was effectively giving away money, which led to the most significant injection of cash into corporate America in history. By November of last year, as cited by the Washington Post, corporate debt had swelled to nearly  ten trillion dollars.\n What was meant to be a temporary move has now become business as usual. While the Fed had resumed raising rates in December 2015, they slashed them back to zero in March of this year, when American deaths from the virus surpassed 100.\n The theory of zero interest rates is that easy access to money will encourage companies to invest and thus grow the economy. In practice, we end up with an awkward flurry of so-called unicorns \u2014 companies with billion-dollar valuations \u2014 as well as already grown-up tech companies like Amazon and Netflix, who are out-spending each other in a vain attempt at monopoly.\n  What kinds of freebies can we expect? Delivery services are currently having their moment during the crisis, so investment will likely continue to inflate the GrubHubs and DoorDashes of the world. For example, in the first month that I used DoorDash, I was offered a month of free delivery. When that ended, I went back to DoorDash and signed up for a free trial of their DashPass, which also has free delivery. When my DoorDash freebies end, I will switch to GrubHub and run the cycle all over again.  ...\n It\u2019s not just the delivery space that will see a happy marriage between subsidy and crisis. Teletherapy and telemedicine are booming as everyone shelters-at-home. Enable My Child, for example, has seen a  surge in demand for online pediatric therapyduring the Pandemic. They currently charge $80/hr., which is a discount from brick-and-mortar rates, and which can be explained by the $1.2 million they raised in 2017. We can expect fundraising rounds of $10 \u201350 million for companies like theirs  ...\n Virtual learning was supposed to become the Next Big Thing a few years ago, around the time when Kahn Academy blew up. But maybe that was too early. Students who had attempted to enroll in virtual classrooms over the past decade have occasionally encountered signs saying, \u201cthis classroom is full, \u201dwhich is odd for Internet businesses. Suddenly, post-COVID, the same classrooms can now fit 40,000 students. The next two years will likely determine who will be the e-learning juggernaut, so we  ...\n Innovative brokerage apps like Robin Hood may go beyond zero commissions and offer cash-back on the first hundred trades for new users. Already, they offer new users a free,  single share of a randomly chosen stock. Given they raised nearly a billion in venture capital, they can afford to subsidize user on-boarding. The promise of owning a platform is so tantalizing to venture capitalists that they \u2019ll flush billions down the drain to train consumers on novel ways of spending their time and  ...\n  So far, most of the bounty has concentrated in creative class hot spots. The notion of the creative class is an awkward one, promulgated by urban futurist Richard Florida, who predicted that cities like Austin and Portland would foster artisanal farmer \u2019s markets and local breweries in an attempt to attract new kinds of \u201cknowledge \u201dworkers. What he couldn \u2019t predict was how coveted this demographic would become to unicorns and wannabe unicorns. For example, one summer in the mid-2010s, Lyft  ...\n  What impact do startups have on jobs? Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow at the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard, believes startups create jobs, saying that, \u201cFrom 1977 to 2005, existing companies were net job destroyers, losing 1 million net jobs per year. In contrast, new businesses in their first year added an average of 3 million jobs annually.\u201d However, this statistic, like many labor statistics,  can\u2019t convincingly say that startupslike Uber and Lyft create jobs. If anything,  ...\n Whether there has been an overall increase in jobs or not is debatable, but at the very least, the  kindsof jobs Americans are getting has changed forever. By racing to spend billions, companies like Amazon and Uber have demanded workers fast, with no strings attached, which has led to the on-demand cottage industry. Amazon warehouse workers, for example, are often older adults who spend most of the year living in mobile homes but pick up a few shifts during the holiday season. Conveniently  ...\n Another impact on the labor market, albeit a smaller one, is in creating zero-skill jobs for recent grads. Even though these tech-enabled startups are supposed to scale their operations in the cloud, they still invariably need bodies in the office. These disposable kids \u2014and they \u2019re usually in their low-to-mid 20s \u2014are meant to be hired quickly, with the least amount of risk. The service associates (i.e., receptionists) at WeWork, all seem to have college degrees, which gives them a  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:45:20", "tags": "\u6765\u5230,flush,\u7f8e\u56fd,jobs",

"note_en": "A month ago  I wrote about changes in Internet traffic caused by the COVID-19 emergency. At the time I wrote:\n Cloudflare is watching carefully as Internet traffic patterns around the world alter as people alter their daily lives through home-working, cordon sanitaire, and social distancing. None of these traffic changes raise any concern for us. Cloudflare&#39;s network is well provisioned to handle significant spikes in traffic. We have not seen, and do not anticipate, any impact on our network&#39;s performance, reliability, or security globally.\n That holds true today; our network is performing as expected under increased load. Overall the Internet has shown that it was  built for this: designed to handle huge changes in traffic, outages, and a changing mix of use. As we are well into April I thought it was time for an update.\n  Here&#39;s a chart showing the relative change in Internet use as seen by Cloudflare since the beginning of the year. I&#39;ve calculated moving average of the trailing seven days for each country and use December 29, 2019 as the reference point.\n  On this chart the highest growth in Internet use has been in Portugal: it&#39;s currently running at about a 50% increase with Spain close behind followed by the UK. Italy flattened out at about a 40% increase in usage towards the end of March and France seems to be plateauing at a little over 30% up on the end of last year.\n It&#39;s interesting to see how steeply Internet use grew in the UK, Spain and Portugal (the red, yellow and blue lines rise very steeply), with Spain and Portugal almost in unison and the UK lagging by about two weeks.\n   Similar increases in utilization are seen here. The US, Canada, Australia and Brazil are all running at between 40% and 50% the level of use at the beginning of the year.\n  We measure the TCP RTT (round trip time) between our servers and visitors to Internet properties that are Cloudflare customers. This gives us a measure of the speed of the networks between us and end users, and if the RTT increases it is also a measure of congestion along the path.\n Looking at TCP RTT over the last 90 days can help identify changes in congestion or the network. Cloudflare connects widely to the Internet via peering (and through the use of transit) and we connect to the  largest number of Internet exchanges worldwide to ensure fast access for all users.\n Cloudflare is also present in 200 cities worldwide; thus the TCP RTT seen by Cloudflare gives a measure of the performance of end-user networks within a country. Here&#39;s a chart showing the median and 95th percentile TCP RTT in the UK in the last 90 days.\n  What&#39;s striking in this chart is that despite the massive increase in Internet use (the grey line), the TCP RTT hasn&#39;t changed significantly. From our vantage point UK networks are coping well.\n   The picture here is slightly different. Both median and 95th percentile TCP RTT increased as traffic increased. This indicates that networks aren&#39;t operating as smoothly in Italy. It&#39;s noticeable, though, that as traffic has plateaued the TCP RTT has improved somewhat (take a look at the 95th percentile) indicating that ISPs and other network providers in Italy have likely taken action to improve the situation.\n This doesn&#39;t mean that Italian Internet is in trouble, just that it&#39;s strained more than, say, the Internet in the UK.\n  The Internet has seen incredible, sudden growth in traffic but continues to operate well. What Cloudflare sees reflects what we&#39;ve heard anecdotally: some end-user networks are feeling the strain of the sudden change of load but are working and helping us all cope with the societal effects of COVID-19.\n It&#39;s hard to imagine another utility (say electricity, water or gas) coping with a sudden and continuous increase in demand of 50%.\n  Internet Performance", "posttime":

"note_en": "For months, Elon Musk has been spreading doubt, confusion, and outright misinformation about the deadliest pandemic of our time.\n Since the outbreak began, he\u2019s promoted studies that suggest doctors are  inflating case numbers for financial reasons, or that  the vast majority of fatalities in Italy are due to other causes. He promoted  a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine, which was debunked so quickly that both Twitter and Google Docs refused to host it. In another instance, he  compared the outbreak to  the common cold. On March 6th, he  said simply \u201cthe coronavirus panic is dumb.\u201d  On March 14th, he said  ...\n  Musk has not entirely dismissed the dangers of the outbreak,  recommending that people stay home while displaying symptoms and that the elderly self-isolate. But those measures are far weaker than the prevailing public health guidance, and the overall picture is clear. In every discussion, Musk has taken the side doubting the threat posed by the novel coronavirus and applauded the lifting of restrictions.\n Most recently, Musk\u2019s vigorous skepticism has led him to promote medical misinformation. On Sunday,  he shared a briefing by two Bakersfield doctors who argued that all distancing restrictions should be lifted immediately, claiming that the ongoing outbreak is no worse than a common case of influenza. The claims were quickly and emphatically condemned by a  rangeof medical groups, and YouTube has since removed the video for violating its community guidelines. But Musk has not deleted his tweet,  ...\n Earlier today, Musk tweeted \u201cFree America Now,\u201d an echo of previous tweets from President Trump calling for an end to the various distancing measures. Neither Tesla nor SpaceX responded to inquiries into Musk\u2019s views on the issue.\n Musk\u2019s exceptional success has been built on counterintuitive bets, so when he stakes out an opposing view, people listen. He has legions of fans across the world ready to take his word over anyone else\u2019s. As the world struggles through a grueling and uncertain period of social distancing, those fans now have reason to flout distancing orders and push for premature reopenings, which would almost certainly make the outbreak worse.\n This skepticism has also directly impacted Musk\u2019s stewardship of Tesla. The company\u2019s Fremont factory is subject to an ongoing public health closure from Alameda County, but Tesla  has defied that order twice:first, keeping the factory open for five days after the order was issued, then calling certain employees back to the factory last week. (The company eventually backed down on the second case.) Thus far, the company has avoided any serious repercussions for skirting the public health rules,  ...\n Musk has a combative relationship with his critics \u2014both in the press and in the business world. He \u2019s behaved recklessly in the past and gotten away relatively clean, whether it was his abortive bid to take Tesla private or bizarre feud with a rescue worker in Thailand. But there is more at stake this time, and Musk \u2019s bizarre Twitter habits are more troubling. We desperately need clear-headed guidance from as many corners as possible.

carmaker&#39;s value after tweeting its share price was too high.\n It also knocked $3bn off Mr Musk&#39;s own stake in Tesla as investors promptly bailed out of the company.\n &#34;Tesla stock price too high imo,&#34; he said, one of several tweets that included a vow to sell his possessions.\n In other tweets, he said his girlfriend was mad at him, while another simply read: &#34;Rage, rage against the dying of the light of consciousness.&#34;\n In 2018, a tweet about Tesla&#39;s future on the New York stock market led to regulators fining the company $20m and Mr Musk agreeing to have all further posts on the platform pre-screened by lawyers.\n   On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported it had asked the billionaire if he was joking about the share price tweet and whether it had been vetted, receiving the reply &#34;No&#34;.\n Tesla&#39;s share price has surged this year, putting the electric carmaker&#39;s value at close to $100bn, a mark that would trigger a bonus payment of hundreds of millions of dollars to the entrepreneur.\n   &#34;We view these Musk comments as tongue in cheek and it&#39;s Elon being Elon. It&#39;s certainly a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot button issue and [Wall] Street clearly is frustrated,&#34; Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives told Reuters news agency.\n In 2018, Mr Musk tweeted that he may have secured funding to possibly remove Tesla from the stock market and take it private, which again led to swings in the share price. The Securities and Exchange Commission judged it a market-moving comment, fined him and forced Tesla to put in place checks to ensure it did not happen again.\n But last month, a federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit by shareholders over the going-private tweet, including a claim that Mr Musk intended to defraud them.\n   Earlier this week he tweeted to his 33.4 million followers some strong criticism of US stay-at-home restrictions because of the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019 he found himself in court last year after tweeting that a British diver was a &#34;pedo guy&#34;.\n Mr Musk said the promise to sell his possessions included his house, formerly owned by actor and producer Gene Wilder, and bought in 2013.\n &#34;One stipulation on sale,&#34; he tweeted, &#34;I own Gene Wilder&#39;s old house. It cannot be torn down or lose any of its soul.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:44:58", "tags": "\u57c3\u9686\u00b7\u9a6c\u65af\u514b,\u7279\u65af\u62c9,\u9a6c\u65af\u514b,musk", "title":

final beta version of iOS 13 \u2014 previously numbered \u201c13.4.5.\u201d Today, the company is changing up the beta cycle with the release of iOS 13.5, a revised version that includes the  coronavirus exposure notification system it co-developed with Google.\n Prior to now, features in the new iOS point release were relatively trivial, including an updated music link sharing feature for social networks, and bug fixes. But the addition of the exposure notification tool is significant. It will enable users of both iPhones and Android phones to optionally cooperate in sharing anonymized location data, flagging potential COVID-19 contacts. If a user is diagnosed with the virus, an anonymous notification can be passed on to people who were within Bluetooth  ...\n  Apple and Google have worked aggressively to build trust in their contact tracing solution,  adding more privacy-focused features into the system last week. But it remains unclear  whether a critical mass of users will actually adopt the feature,and whether it will practically deliver positive results. The United States and some EU countries have backed the initiative, accepting the tech companies \u2019approach to user privacy and decentralizing data, while the United Kingdom has signaled that  ...\n   VB Transform 2020 Online - July 15-17, 2020: Join leading AI executives at VentureBeat&#39;s AI event of the year.

Authorized apps will be able to provide notifications if you \u2019ve  ...\n A smaller feature is designed to speed up iOS 13.5\u2019s authentication of users wearing face masks to protect against the virus. iPhones with Face ID will now quickly display the passcode entry screen when a mask is detected, rather than delaying for a full scan attempt.\n Described as \u201cbeta 3\u201d as it\u2019s carrying forward the release cycle from iOS 13.4.5, iOS 13.5 is available now for download from Apple\u2019s developer site, as well as an over-the-air update for iPhones running the prior beta OS. The prior  iOS 13.4 beta cycle took 1.5 months from start to finish, and the final version of iOS  ...\n Apple\u2019s software development tool Xcode 11.5 has also been released with developer API-level support for the feature, and although its iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS operating systems aren\u2019t expected to add contact tracing, they\u2019ve all been bumped to the\u00a0.5 suffix as well.\n Update at 10:30 a.m. Pacific:A private Google Play services update beta is also being released today, enabling some Android Studio developers to begin testing the exposure notification feature. Android devices will not require a full system update; the new feature will be enabled on phones running Android 6.0 or later.  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:44:54", "tags":

"note_en": "The more researchers know about how the coronavirus attaches, invades and hijacks human cells, the more effective the search for drugs to fight it. That was the idea my colleagues and I hoped to be true when we began building a map of the coronavirus two months ago. The map shows all of the coronavirus proteins and all of the proteins found in the human body that those viral proteins could interact with.\n In theory, any intersection on the map between viral and human proteins is a  place where drugs could fight the coronavirus. But instead of trying to develop new drugs to work on these points of interaction, we turned to the more than 2,000 unique drugs already approved by the FDA for human use. We believed that somewhere on this long list would be a few drugs or compounds that interact with the very same human proteins as the coronavirus.\n  Our multidisciplinary team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco,  called the QCRG, identified 69 existing drugs and compounds with  potential to treat COVID-19. A month ago, we began shipping boxes of these drugs off to  Institut Pasteur in Paris and  Mount Sinai in New York to see if they do in fact fight the coronavirus.\n In the last four weeks, we have tested 47 of these drugs and compounds in the lab against live coronavirus. I\u2019m happy to report we\u2019ve identified some strong treatment leads and identified two separate mechanisms for how these drugs affect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings were  published on April 30 in the journal Nature.\n   The map we developed and the FDA drug catalog we screened it against showed that there were potential interactions between the virus, human cells and existing drugs or compounds. But we didn\u2019t know whether the drugs we identified would make a person more resistant to the virus, more susceptible or do anything at all.\n To find those answers we needed three things: the drugs, live virus and cells in which to test them. It would be optimal to test the drugs in infected human cells. However, scientists don\u2019t yet know which human cells work best for studying the coronavirus in the laboratory. Instead we used African green monkey cells, which are  frequently used in place of human cellsto test antiviral drugs. They can be readily infected with the coronavirus and respond to drugs very closely to the way human  ...\n After infecting these monkey cells with live virus, our partners in Paris and New York added the drugs we identified to half and kept the other half as controls. They then measured the amount of virus in the samples and the number of cells that were alive. If the samples with drugs had a lower virus count and more cells alive compared to the control, that would suggest the drugs disrupt viral replication. The teams were also looking to see how toxic the drugs were to the cells.\n  After sorting through the results of hundreds of experiments using 47 of the predicted drugs, it seems our interaction predictions were correct. Some of the drugs do in fact work to fight the coronavirus, while others make cells more susceptible to infection.\n It is incredibly important to remember that these are preliminary findings and have not been tested in people. No one should go out and buy these drugs.\n But the results are interesting for two reasons. Not only did we find individual drugs that look promising to fight the coronavirus or may make people more susceptible to it; we know, at a cellular level, why this is happening.\n We identified two groups of drugs that affect the virus and they do it two different ways, one of which has never been described.\n  At a basic level, viruses spread by entering a cell, hijacking some of the cell\u2019s machinery and using it to make more copies of the virus. These new viruses then go on to infect other cells. One step of this process involves the cell making new viral proteins out of viral RNA. This is called translation.\n When going through the map, we noticed that several viral proteins interacted with human proteins involved in translation and a number of drugs interacted with these proteins. After testing them, we found two compounds that disrupt the translation of the virus.\n The two compounds are called  ternatin-4 and  zotatifin. Both of these are currently used to treat multiple myeloma and seem to fight COVID-19 by binding to and inhibiting proteins in the cell that are needed for translation.\n Plitidepsin is a similar molecule to ternatin-4 and is currently undergoing a  clinical trial to treat COVID-19. The second drug,  zotatifin, hits a different protein involved in translation. We are working with the CEO of the company that produces it to get it into clinical trials as soon as possible.\n    Cell receptors are found both inside of and on the surface of all cells. They act  like specialized switches. When a specific molecule binds to a specific receptor, this tells a cell to do a specific task. Viruses often use receptors to  infect cells.\n Our original map identified two promising  MV cell receptors for drug treatments, SigmaR1 and SigmaR2. Testing confirmed our suspicions.\n We identified seven drugs or molecules that interact with these receptors. Two antipsychotics,  haloperidol and  melperone, which are used to treat schizophrenia, showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Two potent antihistamines,  clemastine and  cloperastine, also displayed antiviral activity, as did the  compound PB28 and the  female hormone progesterone.\n Remember, all these interactions have so far only been observed in monkey cells in petri dishes.\n At this time we do not know exactly how the viral proteins manipulate the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. We think the virus uses these receptors to help make copies of itself, so decreasing their activity likely inhibits replication and reduces infection.\n Interestingly, a seventh compound \u2013 an ingredient commonly found in  cough suppressants, called dextromethorphan \u2013 does the opposite: Its presence helps the virus. When our partners tested infected cells with this compound, the virus was able to replicate more easily, and more cells died.\n  This is potentially a very important finding, but, and I cannot stress this enough, more tests are needed to determine if cough syrup with this ingredient should be avoided by someone who has COVID-19.\n All these findings, while exciting, need to undergo clinical trials before the FDA or anyone else should conclude whether to take or stop taking any of these drugs in response to COVID-19. Neither people nor policymakers nor media outlets should  panic and jump to conclusions.\n Another interesting thing to note is that hydroxychloroquine \u2013 the controversial drug that has shown  mixed results in treating COVID-19 \u2013 also binds to the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. But based on our experiments in both labs, we do not think hydroxychloroquine binds to them efficiently.\n Researchers have long known that hydroxychloroquine easily binds to receptors in the heart and  can cause damage. Because of these differences in binding tendencies, we don\u2019t think hydroxychloroquine is a reliable treatment.  Ongoing clinical trials should soon clarify these unknowns.\n  Our idea was that by better understanding how the coronavirus and human bodies interact, we could find treatments among the thousands of drugs and compounds that already exist.\n Our idea worked. We not only found multiple drugs that might fight SARS-CoV-2, we learned how and why.\n But that is not the only thing to be excited about. These same proteins that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect and replicate in human cells and that are targeted by these drugs are also hijacked by  related coronaviruses SARS-1 and MERS. So if any of these drugs do work, they will likely be effective against  COVID-22, COVID-24 or any future iterations of COVID that may emerge.\n  The next step is to test these drugs in human trials. We have already started this process and through these trials researchers will examine important factors such as dosage, toxicity and potential beneficial or harmful interactions within the context of COVID-19.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:44:28", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u6cbb\u7597,treat", "title":

"note_en": "Note: The 2020 lines in the charts are provisional data through April 11. The end of the first week of each month is labeled.\n Total deaths in seven states that have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic are nearly 50 percent higher than normal for the five weeks from March 8 through April 11, according to  new death statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is 9,000 more deaths than were reported as of April 11 in official  counts of deaths from the coronavirus.\n The new data is partial and most likely undercounts the recent death toll significantly. But it still illustrates how the coronavirus is causing a surge in deaths in the places it has struck, probably killing more people than the reported statistics capture. These increases belie arguments that the virus is only killing people who would have died anyway from other causes. Instead, the virus has brought a pattern of deaths unlike anything seen in recent years.\n If you look at the provisional deaths from all causes, death counts in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, Maryland and Colorado have spiked far above their normal levels for the period. In New York City, the home of the biggest outbreak, the number of deaths over this period is more than three times the normal number. (Recent data suggests it could have reached  six times higher than normal.)\n  In New Jersey, deaths have been 172 percent of the normal number so far \u2014 more than 5,000 additional deaths, compared with an average count from the past five years. In Michigan, the partial death count is 121 percent of the count in a normal year, the equivalent of nearly 2,000 more deaths.\n These numbers are preliminary because death certificates take time to be processed and collected, and complete death tallies from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can take up to eight weeks to become final. The speed of that data reporting varies considerably by state. In Connecticut, for example, where reported coronavirus deaths are high, the C.D.C. statistics include zero reported deaths from any cause since Feb. 1, because of reporting lags.\n We compared these provisional death counts with the average number of deaths each week over the past five years. Public health researchers use the term \u201cexcess deaths\u201d to describe a gap between recent trends and a typical level of deaths.\n It\u2019s difficult to know whether the differences between excess deaths and the official counts of coronavirus deaths reflect an undercounting of coronavirus deaths or a surge in deaths from other causes. It\u2019s likely a mix of both.\n  There is evidence, in  New York and other places, that the official coronavirus counts are probably too low. Tests for the illness can be hard to get, and not all who die now are being tested, particularly if they die outside a hospital. New York City  recently revised its own statistics for the number of coronavirus-related fatalities, saying thousands of additional deaths were probably because of Covid-19, even though no tests had been conducted.\n There is also increasing evidence that stresses on the health care system and fears about catching the disease have caused some Americans to die from ailments that are typically treatable. A recent  draft paper found that hospital admissions for a major type of  heart attack fell by 38 percent in nine major U.S. hospitals in March. In a normal year, cardiovascular disease is the country\u2019s leading cause of death.\n Some causes of death may actually be going down. There appear to be  fewer road fatalities in California, as more U.S. residents stay at home, for example. It is possible that those reductions could cancel out coronavirus deaths in places where the virus is not yet widespread. But, in many states, any such reductions have been clearly outweighed by increases in deaths directly and indirectly related to the virus.\n  Demographers often use measures of total deaths, sometimes called all-cause mortality, to evaluate the effects of natural disasters, where it can be difficult to trace particular causes.\n In Puerto Rico in 2017, only  64 deaths were initially attributed to Hurricane Maria. But an analysis of the additional deaths showed the way that the disaster had, directly and indirectly, led to nearly  3,000 deaths over six months. The total included the immediate deaths from mudslides and drownings, but also sepsis, diabetes and suicides that came later as the power failure stretched on for months.\n Coronavirus is clearly killing more U.S. residents directly than any hurricane has, but it is also changing lives in ways that may also contribute indirectly to increased deaths \u2014 by overloading the health care system and discouraging people from seeking care.\n Measures of total deaths are also commonly used in countries without detailed accounting of causes of death. Right now, they are the most useful tool, several epidemiologists said, for measuring the impact of coronavirus in the United States, too.\n \u201cIt gives you an overall sense of how big things are,\u201d said Samuel Clark, a professor of sociology at Ohio State University, whose work is in demography and epidemiology. \u201cFor now, you can basically attribute the excess mortality to Covid-19. But you also grab all the things that are not Covid at all, but are probably created by the situation.\u201d\n  Around the world, the coronavirus is bringing large waves of mortality. In Spain, deaths over the last month are 66 percent higher than normal, according to  New York Times reporting. In Ecuador, they are  more than 80 percent higher than normal. In Paris, more than twice as many people are dying every day as normal \u2014 far more than during a typical bad flu season.\n Eventually, we will get more clarity about all of the reasons that people died this year. While no mortality statistics are ever perfect, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses detailed death certificates to code the causes of death for everyone who dies each year in the United States. But that process typically takes more than a year to complete.\n For now, total deaths are our best glimpse into the ways the coronavirus is affecting the normal patterns of survival.\n Sources:  Centers for Disease Control and P revention (total death numbers);  New York Times database of reports from state and local health agencies and hospitals (coronavirus death numbers); New York City health department (coronavirus deaths for New York City) | Notes: Coronavirus deaths for New York City include both confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19.

To be sure, there have been many talented Swedes deserving of international recognition: August Strindberg, Ingmar Bergman, ABBA, Robyn, Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, the founders of Spotify and Skype, and \u2014of course \u2014Alfred Nobel, just to name a few. Sweden \u2019s generous social welfare system, meanwhile, is often held up by envious American progressives as a model to emulate.  ...\n      With its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, though, Sweden\u2019s upright image has been tarnished. Over the past few weeks, the world has watched as Sweden\u2019s public health agency has largely ignored international scientific consensus on the most efficient and lifesaving response to COVID-19: social distancing. Sweden is the only nation in the group of  more economically developed countriestaking an almost entirely laissez-faire approach to the pandemic. As a native Swede who has been based  ...\n        First, it continues to be very difficult to get tested for COVID-19\u2014both for active infection and for antibodies. The Swedish public health agency Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten has  restrictedtesting priority to hospitalized patients and people who work in health or elderly care \u201cwith suspected COVID-19. \u201dThe agency says that patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms should not be prioritized for testing until they are hospitalized, and it is not prioritizing testing of potentially asymptomatic  ...\n          Just as the U.S. and most of Europe were tightening restrictions, Swedish bar owners were  allowed to open their outside patios  earlier than usual. With some minor exceptions, Swedish bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, clubs, and stores remain open to this day. Sweden\u2019s per capita death rate is now among the highest in the world, above the United States and nearly six times as high as some of our Scandinavian neighbors. Total  deaths from COVID-19 in Swedenare nearing 2,500, more  ...\n  For the most part, Sweden\u2019s citizens\u2014many of whom are passionate supporters of progressive human rights, immigration policies, feminism, and equality culture, and of the country\u2019s famed teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg\u2014have gone along with policies leading to large-scale death.\n        Swedes have done the least in Europe to change their movements according to social distancing,  anonymized mobility data from Google has shown. When I flew into Sweden earlier this month from Los Angeles (a necessary trip\u2014taken while dressed in mask, gloves, and a  Beastie Boys\u2019 \u201cIntergalactic\u201d\u2013type faux hazmat suit), it was like arriving in an alternate universe. No screening of any kind took place. There were no pamphlets about COVID-19 precautions. It was like COVID-19  ...\n  What I quickly noticed during the ride to my Stockholm apartment was how things seemed exactly normal for this time of year. Spring, when the Swede wakes up from his winter depression and goes outside to manically face the sun with closed eyes, was the same as it ever was. No one I could see was minding social distance. Caf\u00e9s were full to the brim, and people were picnicking in parks, on the same blanket. And within the first few hours back in Stockholm, I saw more  ...\n    After spending the past decade as a cultural journalist and TV producer in San Francisco and Los Angeles, I have temporarily moved back to Sweden because I want to be close to my 71-year-old mother during this difficult time (all internationally recommended safety precautions  more than taken). To witness the differences between my home country and my adopted country has been confusing and infuriating.\n        There are a number of explanations for Sweden\u2019s unique approach, but they revolve\u2014I think\u2014around a culture of conformity and the self-image of exceptionalism. Prior to my return, the phrase \u201cWe\u2019re only following recommendations\u201d had been regurgitated to me for two months by Swedish friends. Susan Sontag  once described the Swedish capacity for conformity: \u201cWhenever possible, situations and words are taken at face value. \u201dOften, this has meant listening to  ...\n          State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has been one of the loudest and most trusted voices among the country\u2019s pandemic response team. He has taken an almost lobotomized detachment in discussing the tragic costs of his response plan and refused to take responsibility for the worst outcomes of that plan, blaming elder care facilities for the deaths that have been the inevitable result of the government\u2019s approach.\n  \u201cI think to great parts we have been able to achieve what we set out to achieve,\u201d Tegnell recently told the BBC. \u201cWhat has not worked out very well is our death toll, and that\u2019s very much\u2014I mean, it\u2019s partly due to the strategy, but not really very much. It\u2019s mainly due to that our homes for elderly have not been able to keep the disease out.\u201d\n      Another prominent public voice has been Johan Giesecke, previously at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, currently an adviser to the Swedish public health agency. Giesecke \u2019s hot takes about the Swedish model border on the absurd, with his interviews sprinkled with quotes like \u201cI \u2019ve got a gut feeling about this \u201dand \u201cEvery other country is wrong. \u201dSwedes in general don \u2019t seem troubled by this nonsense; both Tegnell and Giesecke  ...\n  There have been some voices of reason outside of the official government response. Swedish virologist Lena Einhorn \u2014a staunch critic of Tegnell and Giesecke \u2014explained to the BBC why she wanted the country to start bending the curve \u2014to give the health care system time to develop therapeutics and possibly a vaccine. Joacim Rockl\u00f6v, professor in epidemiology at Ume\u00e5 University, and Anders Jansson, a doctor at Danderyd Hospital, have also been  ...\n        Many Swedish pundits have aggressively defended Sweden \u2019s COVID-19 model. A destructive culture of bullying against any journalist \u2014and even scientists! \u2014critical of Sweden \u2019s official response has developed, where editorial writers standing on self-proclaimed platforms of empathetic ideologies have been the most disdainful. Blinded by a sense of invincibility, writers have trashed Sweden \u2019s experts and any critical debate in a pandemic  ...\n    What I haven\u2019t seen much of is rational discussion about why there is such unwavering faith that Sweden\u2019s tiny public health agency could be superior to the collected knowledge about COVID-19 in every other economically developed country. One of the few journalists to ask the critical questions on an ongoing basis has been German TV correspondent Christian Stichler, who in a recent Swedish TV debate said there is a missing  streitkultur  ...\n    There have also sadly been few news stories about the dead and their families, or stories about all the Swedish health care workers who have risked their lives under the ghastly conditions our authorities have left them with. For a country as small as Sweden, that alone should be a national trauma.\n    A handful of writers have provided a few non-trolling critical voices. For instance, Peter Wolodarski, the editor in chief of Sweden\u2019s biggest newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, has not bowed to the opinions of many of his own colleagues.\n  The politics of COVID-19 have felt similarly jumbled. I have seen more correlation between the rhetoric of the Swedish left and Fox News than between the Swedish left and progressive movements internationally. It has been the Swedish left that has fiercely praised the Swedish COVID-19 response with overtones of nationalism. That protests over the lockdowns have popped up across America over the past few weeks is of course not  ...\n    Where have Sweden\u2019s government and Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven been in all of this? L\u00f6fven held one somber, prerecorded five-minute address to the nation last month. It wasn\u2019t exactly impassioned, and it offered very little in the way of an actual plan to stop the spread of the virus.\n      This has all been shattering for an at least temporarily repatriated expat. During my decade in California, Sweden has functioned as a mental support cushion of safety and reason, especially after the still-hard-to-fathom election of the star of  The Apprenticeas president of the United States. I \u2019ve held this faith despite Sweden having its own very visible issues with the far-right: The nationalist far-right-wing Sweden  ...\n    One explanation for Sweden \u2019s unique COVID-19 response has been the high trust Swedes have had in their government, historically. That trust has started to slip in recent years, with a divergence between those supporting the rising far-right and those more committed to Sweden \u2019s historical values. L\u00f6fven was barely able to maintain his position as prime minister after our last election in 2018, and he did so by abandoning  ...\n      The Sweden of my youth, meanwhile, was still steered by the idea of  folkhemmet( \u201cthe people \u2019s home \u201d), developed mainly in the 1930s and 1940s. It offered a safe midway point between socialism and capitalism that attracted many human rights leaders, while avoiding communism \u2019s brutal suppression of individual liberty or the destructive and reckless impoverishment of those deemed \u201closers \u201din cutthroat American  ...\n  \u201cThe people\u2019s home,\u201d though, is also unfortunately very much connected to the guiding Swedish principle of  lagom\u2014just the right amount. What  lagom has come to mean in Sweden during COVID-19 is what it usually means: that no one should stick out (paradoxically this is exactly what Sweden is doing internationally). And  lagomis in turn tied to a culture of conflict avoidance that can be found in quotidian Swedish  ...\n        Many Swedes  do reflect critically over Sweden\u2019s COVID-19 response. And increasingly so. But this period seems likely to become a historical note as shameful as when Sweden let the Germans march through Norway.\n  Sweden\u2019s peculiar cultural attributes, the idea of  lagom, unbounded trust in state experts, and an internalized sense of exceptionalism have mainly served Sweden well. But in a global crisis, they become a liability. It is still possible that Sweden \u2019s COVID-19 response could be exonerated \u2014say, herd immunity does take effect and Sweden \u2019s death rate is lower than neighboring countries \u2019at some point down  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:44:05", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u745e\u5178,sweden", "title": "\u6211\u521a\u56de\u5230\u745e\u5178\u7684\u5bb6\u3002\u6211\u88ab\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u53cd\u5e94\u5413\u574f\u4e86", "title_en": "I Just Came Home to Sweden.

However little has been done to estimate the number of suicides due to the lockdowns.\n Earlier covid-19 death models may have erred too far on the side of caution. On March 16th, the Imperial College published a paper estimating the US deaths due to covid-19 to be 2.2M. [1] This study and others have triggered a series of lockdowns across the nation. As of today, April 29th, CDC forecasts \u201conly\u201d 72k deaths due to covid-19. [2] As 47k people die from committing suicide every year in the US [3], the rise of number of suicides due to covid-19 lockdowns should become a major concern.\n Covid-19 lockdowns can and will trigger more suicides for various reasons but we will focus on the two main ones: - Unemployment due to the covid-19 recession - Isolation due to the covid-19 lockdowns\n During the Great Depression, suicide rates increased by 22.8%. [4] Indeed, being unemployed has been found to increase the odds of committing suicide by 246% to 263% varying on gender and age. [5] Covid-19 job losses are expected to reach 47M people. [6] This alone will translate to an additional 9.6k to 10.7k suicides just in 2020. [10]\n Moreover social isolation is as deadly as unemployment.

"note_en": "LONDON \u2014 Tucked in a trendy co-working complex in West London, just past the food court and the payment processing start-up, is perhaps the most technologically backward-looking record company in the world.\n The Electric Recording Co., which has been releasing music since 2012, specializes in meticulous recreations of classical and jazz albums from the 1950s and \u201960s. Its catalog includes reissues of landmark recordings by Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk, as well as lesser-known artists favored by collectors, like the violinist  Johanna Martzy.\n But what really sets Electric Recording apart is its method \u2014 a philosophy of production more akin to the making of small-batch gourmet chocolate than most shrink-wrapped vinyl.\n Its albums, assembled by hand and released in editions of 300 or fewer \u2014at a cost of $400 to $600 for each LP \u2014are made with restored vintage equipment down to glowing vacuum-tube amplifiers, and mono tape systems that have not been used in more than half a century. The goal is to ensure a faithful restoration of what the label \u2019s founder, Pete Hutchison, sees as a lost golden age of record-making. Even its record jackets, printed one by one on letterpress machines, show a fanatical devotion to  ...\n \u201cIt started as wanting to recreate the original but not make it a sort of pastiche,\u201d Hutchison said in a recent interview. \u201cAnd in order not to create a pastiche, we had to do everything as they had done it.\u201d\n Electric Recording\u2019s attention to detail, and Hutchison\u2019s delicate engineering style in mastering old records, have given the label a revered status among collectors \u2014 yet also drawn subtle ridicule among rivals who view its approach as needlessly expensive and too precious by half.\n   Hutchison, 53, whose sharp features and foot-long beard make him look like a wayward wizard from \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d dismissed such critiques as examples of the audiophile world\u2019s catty tribalism. Even the word \u201caudiophile,\u201d he feels, is more often an empty marketing gimmick than a reliable sign of quality.\n \u201cAudiophiles listen with their ears, not with their hearts,\u201d Hutchison said. He added: \u201cThat\u2019s not our game, really.\u201d\n  \u201cThe game is trying to do something that is anti-generic, if you like,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing with these old records is essentially taking the technology from the time and remaking it as it was done then, rather than compromising it.\u201d\n To a large degree, the vinyl resurgence of the last decade has been fueled by reissues. But no reissue label has gone to the same extremes as Electric Recording.\n In 2009, Hutchison bought the two hulking, gunmetal-gray machines he uses to master records \u2014 a Lyrec tape deck and lathe, with Ortofon amplifiers, both from 1965 \u2014 and spent more than $150,000 restoring them over three years. He has invested thousands more on improvements like replacing their copper wiring with mined silver, which Hutchison said gives the audio signal a greater level of purity.\n The machines allow Hutchison to exclude any trace of technology that has crept into the recording process since a time when the Beatles were in moptops. That means not only anything digital or computerized, but also transistors, a mainstay of audio circuitry for decades; instead, the machines\u2019 amplifiers are powered by vacuum tubes (or valves, as British engineers call them).\n  \u201cWe\u2019re all about valves here,\u201d Hutchison said on a tour of the label\u2019s studio.\n Mastering a vinyl record involves \u201ccutting\u201d grooves into a lacquer disc, a dark art in which tiny adjustments can have a big effect. Unusually among engineers, Hutchison tends to master records at low volumes \u2014 sometimes even quieter than the originals \u2014 to bring out more of the natural feel of the instruments.\n He demonstrated his technique during a recent mastering session for \u201cMal/2,\u201d a 1957 album by the jazz pianist Mal Waldron that features an appearance by Coltrane. He tested several mastering levels for the song \u201c One by One\u201d \u2014 which has lots of staccato trumpet notes, played by Idrees Sulieman \u2014 before settling on one that preserved the excitement of the original tape but avoided what Hutchison called a \u201chonk\u201d when the horns reached a climax.\n \u201cWhat you want to hear is the clarity, the harmonics, the textures,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is to put it on and feel like you\u2019ve got to turn it down.\u201d\n These judgments are often subjective. But to test Hutchison\u2019s approach, I visited the New Jersey home of Michael Fremer, a contributing editor at Stereophile and a  longtime champion of vinyl. We listened to a handful of Electric Recording releases, comparing them to pressings of the same material by other companies, on Fremer\u2019s state-of-the-art test system (the speakers alone cost $100,000).\n  I am often skeptical of claims of vinyl\u2019s superiority, but when listening to one of Electric Recording\u2019s albums of Bach\u2019s solo violin pieces played by Martzy, I was stunned by their clearness and beauty. Compared to the other pressings, Electric Recording\u2019s version had vivid, visceral details, yielding a persuasive illusion of a human being standing before me drawing a bow across a violin.\n \u201cIt\u2019s magical what they\u2019re doing, recreating these old records,\u201d Fremer said as he swapped out more Electric Recording discs.\n Hutchison is a surprising candidate to carry the torch for sepia-toned classical fidelity. In the 1990s, he was  a player in the British techno scene with his label Peacefrog; the label\u2019s success in the early 2000s with the minimalist folk of Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez helped finance the obsession that became Electric Recording.\n Hutchison\u2019s conversion happened after he inherited the classical records owned by his father, who died in 1998. A longtime collector of rock and jazz, Hutchison was entranced by the sound of the decades-old originals, and found newer reissues unsatisfying. He learned that Peacefrog\u2019s distributor, EMI, owned the rights to many of his new favorites. Was it possible to recreate things exactly as they had been done the first time around?\n After restoring the machines, Electric Recording put its first three albums on sale in late 2012 \u2014 Martzy\u2019s solo Bach sets, originally issued in the mid-1950s.\n Hutchison decided that true fidelity applied to packaging as well as recording. Letterpress printing drove up his manufacturing costs, and some of the label\u2019s projects have seemed to push the boundaries of absurdity.\n In making \u201c Mozart \u00e0 Paris,\u201d for example, a near-perfect simulacrum of a deluxe 1956 box set, Hutchison spent months scouring London\u2019s haberdashers to find the right strand of silk for a decorative cord. The seven-disc set is Electric Recording\u2019s most expensive title, at about $3,400 \u2014 and one of the few in its catalog that has not sold out.\n  Hutchison defends such efforts as part of the label\u2019s devotion to authenticity. But it comes at a cost. Its manufacturing methods, and the quality-control attention paid to each record, bring no economies of scale. So Electric Recording would gain no reduction in expenses if it made more, thus negating the question Hutchison is most frequently asked: Why not press more records and sell them more cheaply?\n \u201cWe probably make the most expensive records in the world,\u201d Hutchison said, \u201cand make the least profit.\u201d\n Electric Recording\u2019s prices have drawn head-scratching through the cliquey world of high-end vinyl producers. Chad Kassem, whose company  Acoustic Sounds, in Salina, Kan., is one of the world\u2019s biggest vinyl empires, said he admired Hutchison\u2019s work.\n \u201cI tip my hat to any company that goes the extra mile to make things as best as possible,\u201d Kassem said.\n But he said he was proud of Acoustic Sounds\u2019s work, which like Electric Recording cuts its masters from original tapes and goes to great lengths to capture original design details \u2014 and sells most of its records for about $35. I asked Kassem what is the difference between a $35 reissue and a $500 one.\n Yet the market has embraced Electric Recording. Even amid the coronavirus pandemic, Hutchison said, its records have been selling as fast as ever, although the company has had some production hiccups. The only manufacturer of a fabric that Hutchison chose for a Mozart set in the works, by the pianist Lili Kraus, has been locked down in Italy.\n The next frontier for Electric Recording is rock. Hutchison recently got permission to reissue \u201c Forever Changes,\u201d the classic 1967 psychedelic album by the California band Love, and said that the original tape had a more unvarnished sound than most fans had heard. He expects that to be released in July, and \u201cMal/2\u201d is due in August.\n But Hutchison seemed most proud of the label\u2019s work on classical records that seemed to come from a distant era. He pulled out a 10-inch mini-album of Bach by the French pianist Yvonne Lef\u00e9bure, originally released in 1955. Electric Recording painstakingly recreated its dowel spine, its cotton sleeve, its leather cover embossed in gold leaf.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a nice artifact,\u201d Hutchison said, looking at it lovingly. \u201cIt\u2019s a great record as well.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:43:51", "tags": "\u5531\u7247,albums,hutchison", "title": "\u7535\u5b50\u5531\u7247\u516c\u53f8\u6309\u7167\u51e0\u5341\u5e74\u524d\u7684\u5236\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u526a\u8f91\u4e13\u8f91", "title_en": "The Electric Recording Co. cuts albums the way they were made decades ago", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/arts/music/electric-recording-co-vinyl.html", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u5531\u7247", "albums", "hutchison"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000018, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u770b\u6765AMD Zen3CPU\u7ec8\u4e8e\u8981\u652f\u6301PCID\u4e86\uff01\u81f3\u5c11\u6839\u636eAMD\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u53c2\u8003\u624b\u518c\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4fdd\u62a4\u5bc6\u94a5\u4e5f\u5c06\u9762\u4e16\u3002AMD\u5df2\u7ecf\u51fa\u7248\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u53c2\u8003\u624b\u518c\u7684\u65b0\u4fee\u8ba2\u7248\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b0\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u7528\u4e8ePCID\u548cPKEY\u3002\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u4e0e\u8fdb\u7a0b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u4e00\u6837\u7684PCID\u7ec8\u4e8e\u5728AMD CPU\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u652f\u6301\u3002PCID\u81ea2010\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u7531\u82f1\u7279\u5c14CPU\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u800c\u81ea2018\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u8c08\u8bbaPCID\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e.", "note_en": "It looks like AMD Zen 3 CPUs will finally be supporting PCID!

generate new C# source files that can be added to a compilation. This is done via a new kind of component that we\u2019re calling a Source Generator.\n To get started with Source Generators, you\u2019ll need to install the latest  .NET 5 preview and the latest  Visual Studio preview.\n  Unless you\u2019ve been closely following every prototype and proposal related to the C# language and compiler, then there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re asking, \u201cWhat is a Source Generator\u201d right now. A Source Generator is a piece of code that runs during compilation and can inspect your program to produce additional files that are compiled together with the rest of your code.\n A Source Generator is a new kind of component that C# developers can write that lets you do two major things:\n Retrieve a  Compilation object that represents all user code that is being compiled. This object can be inspected and you can write code that works with the syntax and semantic models for the code being compiled, just like with analyzers today.\n Generate C# source files that can be added to a  Compilation object during the course of compilation. In other words, you can provide additional source code as input to a compilation while the code is being compiled.\n When combined, these two things are what make Source Generators so useful. You can inspect user code with all of the rich metadata that the compiler builds up during compilation, then emit C# code back into the same compilation that is based on the data you\u2019ve analyzed! If you\u2019re familiar with Roslyn Analyzers, you can think of Source Generators as analyzers that can emit C# source code.\n   A Source Generator is a .NET Standard 2.0 assembly that is loaded by the compiler along with any  analyzers. It is usable in environments where .NET Standard components can be loaded and run.\n Now that you know what a Source Generator is, let\u2019s go through some of the scenarios they can improve.\n  The most important aspect of a Source Generator isn\u2019t what it is, but what it can enable.\n Today, there are three general approaches to inspecting user code and generating information or code based on that analysis used by technologies today: runtime reflection, IL weaving, and juggling MSBuild tasks. Source Generators can be an improvement over each approach.\n Runtime reflection is a powerful technology that was added to .NET a long time ago. There are countless scenarios for using it. A very common scenario is to perform some analysis of user code when an app starts up and use that data to generate things.\n For example, ASP.NET Core uses reflection when your web service first runs to discover constructs you \u2019ve defined so that it can \u201cwire up \u201dthings like controllers and razor pages. Although this enables you to write straightforward code with powerful abstractions, it comes with a performance penalty at runtime: when your web service or app first starts up, it cannot accept any requests until all the runtime reflection code that discovers information about your code is finished running!  ...\n With a Source Generator, the controller discovery phase of startup could instead happen at compile time by analyzing your source code and emitting the code it needs to \u201cwire up\u201d your app. This could result in some faster startup times, since an action happening at runtime today could get pushed into compile time.\n Source Generators can improve performance in ways that aren \u2019t limited to reflection at runtime to discover types as well. Some scenarios involve calling the MSBuild C# task (called CSC) multiple times so they can inspect data from a compilation. As you might imagine, calling the compiler more than once affects the total time it takes to build your app! We \u2019re investigating how Source Generators can be used to obviate the need for juggling MSBuild tasks like this, since Source generators  ...\n Another capability Source Generators can offer is obviating the use of some  \u201cstringly-typed\u201d APIs, such as how ASP.NET Core routing between controllers and razor pages work.  With a Source Generator, routing  can be strongly typed with the necessary strings being generated as a compile-time detail. This  would reduce the amount of times a mistyped string literal leads to a request not hitting the correct controller.\n As we flesh out the API and experience writing Source Generators more, we anticipate more scenarios to become evident. We\u2019re also planning on working with partner teams to help them adopt Source Generators if it improves their core scenarios.\n  Another characteristic of Source Generators is that they can help remove major barriers to linker-based and AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation optimizations. Many frameworks and libraries make heavy use of reflection or reflection-emit, such as  System.Text.Json,  System.Text.RegularExpressions, and frameworks like ASP.NET Core and WPF that discover and/or emit types from user code at runtime.\n We\u2019ve also identified that many of the top  NuGet packages people make heavy use of reflection to discover types at runtime. Incorporating these packages is essential for most .NET apps, so the \u201clinkability\u201d and ability for your code to make use of AOT compiler optimizations is greatly affected. We\u2019re looking forward to working with our wonderful OSS community to see how these packages could use source generators and improve the overall .NET ecosystem.\n  All the previous examples of source generators mentioned earlier are pretty complex. Let\u2019s go through a very basic one to show some of the key pieces you\u2019ll need to write your own Source Generator.\n The goal is to let users who have installed this Source Generator always have access to a friendly \u201cHello World\u201d message and all syntax trees available during compilation. They could invoke it like this:\n  Over time, we\u2019ll make getting started a lot easier in tools with templates. For now, here\u2019s how to do it manually:\n   The key pieces of this is that the project can generate a NuGet package and it depends on the bits that enable Source Generators.\n 2. Modify or create a C# file that specifies your own Source Generator like so:\n     4. Add the source generator from a project as an analyzer and add  preview to the LangVersion\u00a0to the project file like this:\n  If you\u2019ve written Roslyn Analyzers before, the local development experience should be similar.\n When you write your code in Visual Studio, you\u2019ll see that the Source Generator runs and the generated source file is added to your project. You can now access it as if you had created it yourself:\n  Note: you will currently need to restart Visual Studio to see IntelliSense and get rid of errors with the early tooling experience\n There are many more things you can do with Source Generators than just something simple like this:\n  The  Source Generators Cookbook goes over some of these examples with some recommended approaches to solving them.\n Additionally, we have a  set of samples available on GitHub that you can try on your own.\n As mentioned earlier, we\u2019re working on making the experience authoring and using Source Generators better in tooling, such as adding templates, allowing for seamless IntelliSense and navigation, debugging, and improving responsiveness and performance in Visual Studio when generating source files.\n  As mentioned earlier in this post, this is the first preview of Source Generators. The intention of releasing this first preview is to let library authors try out the feature and give us feedback on what \u2019s missing and what needs to change. From preview to preview, there may be changes in the API and characteristics of source generators. We intend on shipping Source Generators as GA with C# 9, and sometime later this year we intend on stabilizing the API and features  ...\n  If you own a .NET library written in C#, now is a great time to evaluate Source Generators and see if they\u2019re a good fit. There\u2019s a good chance that if your library makes heavy use of reflection, you\u2019ll benefit in some way.\n   Give us your feedback and let us know what you need! We\u2019d love to learn more about how you think Source Generators could improve your code, and what you feel is missing or needs changing.\n  This first preview is is exactly that: a first preview. There is a basic editing experience in Visual Studio, but it is not what we would consider \u201c1.0 quality \u201dright now. We may explore a few different designs over time before we commit to a particular one. One of the biggest areas of focus between now and the .NET 5 release will be improving the editing experience for Source Generators. Additionally, we expect to modify the API to accommodate feedback from partner  ...\n Additionally, we\u2019ll ensure a good experience for how Source Generators are distributed. We\u2019re currently designing them to be very similar to Analyzers that can be shipped alongside a package. They currently use the Analyzer infrastructure to handle configuration in editor tooling.\n  Below is a list of questions we anticipate some people might have. We\u2019ll update this list with more questions as they come.\n  Source Generators are a form of metaprogramming, so it \u2019s natural to compare them to similar features in other languages like macros. The key difference is that Source Generators don \u2019t allow you _rewrite_ user code. We view this limitation as a significant benefit, since it keeps user code predictable with respect to what it actually does at runtime. We recognize that rewriting user code is a very powerful feature, but we \u2019re unlikely to enable Source Generators  ...\n  If you\u2019re an F# programmer (or familiar with the language), then you might have heard of  Type Providers. Source Generators were inspired in part by Type Providers, but there are several differences that make them distinct. The main difference is that Type Providers are a part of the F# language proper and emit types, properties, and methods in-memory based on an external source. Source Generators are a compiler feature that analyzes C# source code, optionally  ...\n  No! Reflection is an incredibly useful tool to use. Reflection does present some performance and \u201clinkability\u201d challenges that can be solvable with Source Generators in some scenarios. We recommend carefully evaluating if Source Generators fit your scenario.\n  Source Generators are similar to analyzers, since both are compiler features that let you plug into a compilation. The key difference is that analyzers ultimately emit diagnostics that can be used to associate with a code fix. Source Generators ultimately emit C# source code that is added to a compilation. There are several other differences discussed in the  design document.\n  No. As mentioned earlier, Source Generators do not allow you to rewrite user source code. We do not intend on allowing them to this. They can only augment a compilation by adding C# source files to it.\n  We intend on shipping Source Generators with C# 9. However, in the event that they aren\u2019t ready in time, we\u2019ll keep them in preview and ensure that users need to opt in to use them.\n  Technically, yes. Source Generators are .NET Standard 2.0 components, and like any project you can change the TFM. However, they only support being loaded into consuming projects as .NET Standard 2.0 components today.\n  Source Generators are currently a C# only feature. Because this is the first preview, there are many things that can change between now and the released version. We do not intend on adding Source Generators to Visual Basic at this time. If you\u2019re an F# developer and want to see this feature added, please search the suggestions or file a new one in the  F# language suggestion repository.\n  This depends on how libraries are authored. Since VB and F# currently don \u2019t support Source Generators, library authors should avoid designing their features such that they require a Source Generator. Ideally, features have fallbacks to runtime reflection and/or reflection emit. This is something that library authors will need to careful consider before adopting Source Generators. We expect most library authors will use Source Generators to augment \u2013rather  ...\n Why do I not get IntelliSense for generated code? Why does Visual Studio say there\u2019s an error even though it builds?\n You will need to restart Visual Studio after building the source generator to make errors go away and IntelliSense appear for generated source code. After you do that, things will work. Currently, Visual Studio integration is very early on. This current behavior will change in the future so that you don\u2019t need to restart Visual Studio.\n  Eventually, we\u2019ll support navigation and debugging of generated source in Visual Studio. It is not yet supported in this early preview stage.\n  Source Generators can be shipped as NuGet packages, just like Analyzers today. In fact, they use the same \u201cplumbing\u201d as Analyzers. If you\u2019ve ever shipped an Analyzer, then you can easily ship a Source Generator.\n  Eventually, yes. But this is still the first preview of the technology, and a lot of things may need to change to accommodate various scenarios. There is currently no timeline for when Microsoft-authored Source Generators are available.\n  Although Source Generators are not technically a C# language feature, they are in preview.

What the f---. Excuse me. Outrage. Outrage.&#34;\n Back  on March 6, as the US first began reporting cases within its borders, the billionaire first said panic about the coronavirus &#34;is dumb.&#34; Known US cases now top 1 million. On Tuesday, he ratcheted up his complaints on Twitter, urging leaders to &#34;FREE AMERICA NOW&#34; and praising Texas&#39; plan to relax rules starting Friday.\n   &#34;It will cause great harm, not just to Tesla but to many companies,&#34; Musk said on the call. &#34;And while Tesla will weather the storm, there are many companies that will not. Everything people have worked for their whole life is being destroyed in real time.&#34;\n Musk even went so far as to call it undemocratic for state governments to order shutdowns of businesses deemed nonessential.\n &#34;If somebody wants to stay in their house, that&#39;s great and they should be able to,&#34; he said. &#34;But to say they cannot leave their house and that they will be arrested if they do, that&#39;s fascist. That is not democratic \u2014 this is not freedom.
