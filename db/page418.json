"note_en": "Between 2012 and 2018, 28.3 million mail-in ballots remain unaccounted for, according to data from the federal Election Assistance Commission. The missing ballots amount to nearly one in five of all absentee ballots and ballots mailed to voters residing in states that do elections exclusively by mail.\n States and local authorities simply have no idea what happened to these ballots since they were mailed \u2013 and the figure of 28 million missing ballots is likely even higher because some areas in the country, notably Chicago, did not respond to the federal agency\u2019s survey questions. This figure does not include ballots that were spoiled, undeliverable, or came back for any reason.\n  Although there is no evidence that the millions of missing ballots were used fraudulently, the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which  compiled the public data provided from the Election Assistance Commission, says that the sheer volume of them raises serious doubts about election security.\n These questions are particularly relevant as the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing states across the country to rapidly expand vote-by-mail operations in an election year. Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden have proposed the\u00a0 Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act of 2020, a bill that would allow every eligible voter the opportunity to vote by mail, regardless of state laws governing mail-in ballots.\n A significant increase in mail-in voting this fall could greatly incentivize \u201cballot harvesting,\u201d where third parties collect mail-in ballots on behalf of voters and deliver them to election officials. There\u2019s long been a consensus that such a practice incentivizes fraud, and ballot harvesting is illegal in most of the country. Public debate over the issue has intensified in recent years after a  GOP operative in North Carolina was indicted for crimes related to ballot harvesting in 2018.\n  That same election cycle  California legalized ballot harvesting, and observers say the practice played a key role in ousting several Republican congressmen in Orange County in 2018, a longstanding GOP stronghold in a state that has become very liberal in recent decades.\n The fact that millions of unused mail-in ballots are floating around in every election cycle \u201cis not a secret type data here \u2013it&#39;s sitting there on the Internet, and you&#39;re paying for the server cost, \u201dnotes Logan Churchwell, a spokesman for PILF. \u201cSo what do people that really focus on the election process do about that? They go into ballot harvesting. If there&#39;s so many ballots out there in the wind unaccounted for by election officials, surely some manpower could be dedicated  ...\n To illustrate the risk, Churchwell notes that in 2016 Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by garnering over 2.8 million more votes than Donald Trump. But nearly 6 million unaccounted mail-in ballots were never counted in 2016, more than twice her margin in the popular vote. The potential to affect elections by chasing down unused mail-in ballots and make sure they get counted \u2013 using methods that may or may not be legal \u2013 is great.\n There\u2019s little doubt that as the number of mail-in ballots increases, so does fraud. A 2012  report in The New York Times noted that voter fraud involving mail-in ballots \u201cis vastly more prevalent than the in-person voting fraud that has attracted far more attention, election administrators say. In Florida, absentee-ballot scandals seem to arrive like clockwork around election time.\u201d According to  a Wall Street Journal reporton voter exploitation in Hispanic communities in Texas, mail-in ballots  ...\n  Concerns about fraud in mail-in ballots were serious enough that a 2008  report produced by the CalTech/MIT Voting Technology Project recommended that states \u201crestrict or abolish on-demand absentee voting in favor of in-person early voting.\u201d\n \u201cThe convenience that on-demand absentees produces is bought at a significant cost to the real and perceived integrity of the voting process,\u201d the report added. \u201cOn the face of it, early voting can provide nearly equal convenience with significantly greater controls against fraud and coercion.\u201d Similarly,  another academic studydone in 2008 from Reed College flagged various concerns related to absentee voting and conceded there is a \u201cgreat deal of literature on turnout \u201dbut when it comes  ...\n Despite these concerns, five states \u2013 Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Utah, and Hawaii \u2013 now do all elections exclusively by mail. Supporters point to smooth elections in these states as proof that it works. But PILF obtained voter data from Oregon, the first state to adopt voting by mail exclusively, for the 2012 and 2018 elections and checked it against census data. Of the 7 million ballots the state sent out in those two elections, some 871,000 ballots are totally unaccounted for.\n Losing only one of eight ballots, as opposed to the national average of one in five, may be the result of Oregon having a more accurate listing of voters\u2019 addresses than many other states, but that\u2019s still a very high percentage of missing ballots, and Oregon would not reveal its data for the 2014 and 2016 elections for reasons the state would not disclose.\n Regardless, U.S. Census data confirms that 11% of Americans move every year, and voters on the lower end of the economic scale are especially transient. Without implementing some extensive, and likely problematic, government surveillance program, there \u2019s no way for election administrators to reliably get ballots to tens of millions of Americans every election cycle without a large percentage of ballots going to the wrong address. This problem is compounded by states that mail ballots  ...\n The inherent problems of mail-in voting are being widely ignored, however. Use of mail-in ballots more than doubled from 24.9 million in 2004 to 57.2 million in 2016, and around 40% of U.S. votes are now done by mail. Along with this dramatic increase there have been virtually no new safeguards, scrutiny, or additional research on the risks of vote by mail. If the current pandemic is going to force the issue during a presidential election, proponents of voting by mail may have to address  ...\n \u201cI really think the only reason vote-by-mail problems are not getting more attention on a regular basis, is that it&#39;s kind of an embarrassing problem and people just aren\u2019t paying attention,\u201d says Churchwell. \u201cThese numbers of missing ballots demonstrate large voter list maintenance failures and security gaps within the broader mail voting process.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:41", "tags":

Jeff Bezos testify after Democratic leaders said they suspected  Amazon of lying to Congress.\n    Seven bipartisan members of the committee said in a  letter to Bezos that a recent Wall Street Journal report on Amazon&#39;s use of third-party seller data appears to show that Amazon may have misled Congress in previous statements.\n &#34;If the reporting in the Wall Street Journal article is accurate, then statements Amazon made to the Committee about the company&#39;s business practices appear to be misleading, and possibly criminally false or perjurious,&#34; they wrote.\n Amazon&#39;s stock fell 7.6% Friday, a day after the company reported earnings. The company has pledged to invest its expected $4 billion Q2 profit into coronavirus-related efforts.\n The Journal investigation\u00a0found Amazon employees used  nonaggregated or easily identifiable data from third-party sellers to figure out which products to make on its own. The report was based on interviews with more than 20 former Amazon employees and documents reviewed by the Journal.\n  The report appeared to contradict testimony by Amazon&#39;s associate general counsel Nate Sutton at a July hearing before the House Antitrust Subcommittee, which is investigating Amazon and three of its peers on antitrust grounds.\n At the hearing, Sutton said Amazon does not use individual seller data to determine its strategy, a tactic that would likely be considered anti-competitive. Advocates for strong antitrust enforcement, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have argued that companies should not be able to own and compete on a marketplace because it could encourage unfair practices.\n Bezos is the only CEO of the big four tech firms \u2014 Amazon,  Apple,  Google and  Facebook \u2014 who has never before testified in front of Congress. The company has faced scrutiny over the past year as lawmakers and regulators assess issues of privacy and dominance among tech companies. In addition to the House Antitrust Subcommittee investigation, Amazon also faces a probe by the Federal Trade Commission, according to Bloomberg.\n House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., who is one of the seven signatories of the letter, said last week the report shows that Amazon  &#34;may have lied to Congress&#34;in its previous testimony to the subcommittee. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who also signed the letter, previously said that if true, the Journal&#39;s report &#34;raises deep concerns about Amazon&#39;s apparent lack of candor before the Committee regarding an issue that is central  ...\n Friday&#39;s letter said it was important for Bezos to testify as CEO and would &#34;reserve the right to resort to compulsory process if necessary.&#34;\n The letter was also signed by the top Republican on the subcommittee, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, subcommittee Vice Chairman Joe Neguse D-Colo., and Reps. Pramila Jayapal D-Wash., Ken Buck, R-Colo., and Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n The top Republican on the full committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is not listed as one of the signatories. Jordan was  newcomer to the antitrust probe after replacing Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., in the position as Collins pursues a Senate bid. A Republican spokesperson for the Judiciary Committee said in a statement, &#34;Of course our Members have questions for Amazon and want to get answers for the American people. But we wonder what Judiciary Democrats&#39; true motivations are. Earlier  ...\n Collins and Sensenbrenner  threatened in February to &#34;not participate in an investigation with pre-conceived conclusions that America&#39;s large tech companies are inherently bad, cannot be allowed to exist in society, and must be broken up.&#34; The comment came after a video from a fundraising event showed Nadler talking about &#34;changing the distribution of power&#34; and &#34;breaking up all the large companies,&#34; though not specifically referring to the tech industry.\n An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the letter. A spokesperson previously told CNBC,\u00a0&#34;It&#39;s\u00a0simply incorrect to suggest that Amazon was intentionally misleading in our testimony.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:38", "tags":

"note_en": "Skip to content     Our analysis of data from major ISPs found that the average customer who rents equipment for their internet service could save upwards of  $150 per year by purchasing their own router.\n In contrast, a top-rated router can be as cheap as $70 as a one-time expense.\n Purchasing personal equipment will save consumers  $750 over the lifetime of a router and thousands more over a lifetime of internet usage.\n It \u2019s something that most people don \u2019t think about, but when they sign up for residential internet service, there are often several hidden costs that can drastically increase their monthly bill. One of the most expensive additions is paying to rent equipment directly from the ISP like a router and modem. While most people might not notice a $10-$15 addition on the cable bill each month, over the lifetime of a service plan, those costs can add up to hundreds or even thousands of  ...\n To get a specific number, we pulled data from all major ISPs to average out how much customers are paying to rent equipment directly from their cable company. For internet service, for example, the average customer is paying between $12-$15 per month to rent equipment like a router and modem.\n Over the lifetime of a cable contract, this could end up being thousands of dollars. In other words, you could end up making costly payments for a piece of equipment that costs less than $100 that will last years.\n By researching major e-commerce platforms, consumers can easily find a high-quality router for $50-$70, depending on their needs. This one-time expense will pay for itself in under six months, and will rarely need a replacement or upgrade. Even more expensive, top-of-the-line routers will pay for themselves within a year or two.\n There might be an argument that many consumers feel intimidated by managing their own equipment, as things like set up and maintenance can feel technically demanding for the average person. While most ISPs won\u2019t provide service on the equipment you\u2019re not renting from them, it\u2019s rare for a router to need much more maintenance than the occasional reset. Once the initial setup is complete, it would be unusual to need much more technical support.\n We spoke with several cable customers about their experience setting up their own router, and they found it to be far less complicated than they had imagined.\n \u201cIt took maybe 15 minutes and I\u2019m not a technical person. I followed the instructions in the box and had my own router working with no issues at all,\u201d one respondent said when asked about their experience.\n It can be important to upgrade equipment every so often, but it\u2019s not an annual requirement or even every two to three-year commitment. While the demand for faster downloads for things like movies and TV streaming services or online games has never been higher, most routers will be up to the task for years to come. And while technology and security changes may cause the need for an update after five years or so, major brands will continue to support their products.\n If you are looking for a simple way to trim expenses from your monthly budget, consider purchasing your own router instead of renting it directly from your ISP.\n Sign up for our email newsletter, Magnified, where we uncover surprising truths, go behind the scenes of our reviews, and arm you with great dinner party conversation.\n I would like to subscribe to Reviews.com newsletter.

As such it seemed only appropriate to take a look back over the past decade at not only the history of OSHUG, but some of the history and the future of open hardware also.\n    Let\u2019s begin a little earlier and around 12-13 years ago. My own introduction to open source hardware \u2014 note that I will also use  open hardware interchangeably and to mean the same thing \u2014 came in 2007/2008 via two different routes. The first of these being a fellow co-founder of Glasgow hackerspace, the  Electron Club, who was excited at the artistic possibilities presented by the new Arduino platform. The second was a  BT Osmosoftcolleague who spotted the recently announced Bug Labs hardware  ...\n   Bug Labsare still around today and it appears their focus shifted from hardware to services. Of course, the Arduino story is well known and for many years it served as the open hardware poster child. What followed next, at least in the most visible sense, was a burgeoning ecosystem of relatively simple board designs \u2014such as breakout modules for surface mount devices, along with Arduino compatibles and add-ons. There was a growing movement and this was focused mostly around microcontrollers  ...\n   At this point it would be remiss not to mention two notable exceptions. The first of these being  Openmoko, which set out to create a family of mobile phones with an open hardware specification \u2014 schematics and mechanical CAD files were provided \u2014 and open source O/S. Also another consumer electronics product, the  Chumby, an embedded computer with a touch screen and WiFi.\n In addition to which,  Elphel had been quietly producing open hardware and free software powered video cameras for some time. Notably also there was OpenSPARC from Sun and the grassroots open silicon community, OpenCores, together with its flagship project, OpenRISC. These and other early open silicon efforts are covered in more detail in Gareth\u2019s article,  Digital FOSSils.\n    The nascent open hardware movement had started to gather momentum and in December 2009,  Nesta, the UK based charity and innovation foundation, hosted a  one day event dedicated to the topic. This served as a pivotal moment for many of those of us who attended and one outcome of this being the formation of the  Open Source Hardware User Group.\n   OSHUG was co-founded in early 2010 by Paul Downey, Alan Wood and myself. Inspired by the Nesta event and also encouraged by UK semiconductor company,  XMOS, which had decided to publish its development board designs as open hardware.\n Fortunately, Paul and I both worked for BT\u2019s open source innovation unit, Osmosoft, where community events were part of its remit. So on Thursday 29 th April 2010 we hosted the  first ever OSHUG meeting. For this we were honoured to have Professor David May \u2014 architect of the Transputer and then CTO of XMOS \u2014 present.\n   We decided from the outset that, although the focus would primarily be hardware with liberal licensed design artefacts, we would also encourage talks on related topics, such as embedded development, along with tools and techniques employed in hardware design and manufacture. A policy which has served OSHUG well and led to an ever interesting mix of topics.\n   Free and open source software is mainstream. Free and open hardware isn\u2019t.  OSHUG #2.\n The first few meetings really enabled the group to establish itself and this wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the support of BT Osmosoft. Themes explored included  licensing and  community, along with topics such as  software-defined radio and  FPGA development. For the sixth meeting we were hosted by  London Hackspace and for the  seventh the BBC, which featured talks on the BBC Computer Literacy project \u2014 which gave birth to the BBC Micro \u2014 and Domesday project.\n The eighth meeting was the last that was held at the Osmosoft offices (the security arrangements at the Westminster telephone exchange we occupied were\u2026 tricky).\n For the  ninth meeting we were kindly hosted by Skills Matter. This featured an introduction to FPGA programming from Omer Kilic, a talk on OpenCores and OpenRISC from Dr Jeremy Bennett, and Lawrence Wilkinson gave a talk on emulating an IBM System/360 mainframe in FPGA.\n   For the next few years, the now much missed,  Centre for Creative Collaboration in Kings Cross became our home.\n We also had an  outing to the University of Kent, courtesy of Omer Kilic, and in October 2011 we held our first ever  Open Source Hardware Camp (OSHCamp). This featured 3D printing and IoT workshops, along with an exploration of collaboration in open source hardware.\n   The 29 th meeting was the first hosted by the  BCS and in partnership with its  Open Source Specialist Group (OSSG). At this we had a talk on the RepRap 3D printer, from its creator, Dr Adrian Bowyer. For the next meeting we were hosted by Erlang Solutions, before returning to BCS London, which then became our new home and continues to be up until the present day.\n    Early 2011 I relocated to the north of England and then travelled to London for OSHUG events. However, I also managed to persuade the group that we should host the next OSHCamp in Hebden Bridge \u2014 after an initial response of, \u201cWhere?!\u201d This turned out to provide a perfect setting for a weekend of talks and workshops in more relaxed environs, with plenty of opportunity to socialise.\n   Over the years and now that we \u2019re up to 80 events in total, OSHUG has seen talks on an incredibly diverse range of topics related to open hardware; FPGAs, chip design and verification, wireless, education, music, security, privacy, performance, tools, compilers, EMC, design for manufacture, automotive \u2014and more. Not to mention also hands-on workshops covering a wide variety of topics, including software-defined radio, machine learning and Internet of Things, for example.  ...\n   Regular evening meetings continue to be hosted by BCS and held in partnership with OSSG. A special thanks to Professor Cornelia Boldyreff and Dr Jeremy Bennett for their support.\n OSHCamp takes place annually \u2014 although perhaps not  this year\u2026 \u2014 and in addition to being hosted in Hebden Bridge, was held in Lincoln in 2018, with thanks to Sarah Markall for making this happen. A special thanks also to Alan Wood, Ken Boak, Omer Kilic and Paul Tanner, who together with Jeremy Bennett have compered and presented at many OSHUG meetings.\n   Having been convener and main event organiser for the first 6 or so years, regular monthly events are now organised by Sevan Janiyan and Andy Bennett, who do an excellent job with programming. I continue as the main organiser for OSHCamp and look forward to its return in 2021.\n Next I\u2019d like to take a look at wider advances in open hardware, the present day, and the future.\n    Go back ten years and most activity was focused around PCB designs, with the majority being relatively simple. Collaboration was a hot topic, but wasn \u2019t easy and remains far more difficult than with software; different design tools and minimal interoperability continuing to present a challenge, in addition to which the processes involved just aren \u2019t the same as with software. Hence designs are typically completed by one person or a close knit team and published when  ...\n   While collaborative PCB design hasn\u2019t taken off, we have seen increasingly advanced open source hardware designs, such as the  Novena laptop and  LimeSDR familyof software-defined radios, along with ever more capable FPGA development boards. That these may not be developed in a collaborative manner \u2014as is often (but not always!) the case with open source software \u2014is not an issue. Rather instead it \u2019s just a simple fact of the development process and factors involved.  ...\n   As we saw at OSHUG meetings and in the wider community, open hardware is by no means limited to electronics and PCB design. For example, the RepRap 3D printer and  Global Village Construction Set involve significant elements of mechanical design. However, such projects are comparatively small in number and mech design has similar challenges to PCB design.\n Over the past ten years we\u2019ve seen the proliferation of hacker/maker spaces and the Raspberry Pi \u2014 even though not open hardware itself \u2014 has had significant impact in terms of getting more involved people hands-on with electronics; the community continues to grow and mature. In addition to which, there have been numerous advances in open hardware licensing and improvements in FOSS tooling.\n   Sun made a remarkably bold move with OpenSPARC and open sourcing the T1 core in 2006. However, an FPGA board capable of hosting the design would have set you back quite a bit and it had few users outside of academia. There was also the OpenCores community and, as noted in Digital FOSSils, OpenRISC found its way into a Samsung digital TV SoC, amongst other uses.\n Although, generally speaking, FPGAs and digital design were seen as complex and/or difficult. In part because the skills required are less common than software development, with many in the early open hardware community being \u201ccrossover software developers\u201d, self-taught and/or enthusiasts. This is something that  Chip Hackset out to address, with the first event hosted in London in 2013, a second in Cambridge in 2014, and then a much larger event in Hebden Bridge  ...\n   Meanwhile FPGA development boards have continued to become cheaper and more powerful, with a constantly growing enthusiast community, in part as a result of this and perhaps also while looking for the next challenge.\n Of course, open hardware is now also gaining serious traction in the semiconductor industry, which is something that I\u2019ll come to later. Meanwhile there have also been groundbreaking advances in tooling \u2014 which is a topic for another day.\n    At the time of writing, over 12,000 LimeSDR boards have been shipped to developers and while this figure is much lower than it would be for, say, Arduino, it is impressive for an advanced design of its specialist nature. The open hardware design has also enabled derivative designs, such as one that has been  integrated into a cubesat. Furthermore, its impact in industry is now being seen as the LimeSDR platform is at the heart of the  CrowdCell developed  via the  ...\n   The Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation has been hosting packed out conferences for a number of years now, with delegates and speakers from across industry and academia. The foundation also participates in Google Summer of Code, hosts  LibreCores, is home to a number a projects and workgroups, and produces a  monthly newsletter with a steadily growing readership.\n The advent of the  RISC-V open ISA clearly acted as a catalyst and has generated a groundswell in interest in open silicon, with other ISAs also now starting to follow suit, such as  OpenPOWER.\n   Although gathering pace in more recent years, RISC-V can trace its history back to 2010 and what we \u2019re seeing now is the result of the multi-year efforts of the founders, contributors, sponsors and, of course, the RISC-V Foundation and its membership. While at the same time being able to take advantage of the earlier work of the OpenCores community, whether utilising an i2c core or some other simpler IP, or just benefiting from an established community and  ...\n   More recently the  CHIPS Alliance was set up under the auspices of the Linux Foundation and has workgroups focusing on the Chisel HDL, RISC-V Rocket chip generator, cores, tools and interconnects. We also have the  OpenHW Group driving collaborative development of open source cores, related IP, tools and software. This boasts an impressive membership and has 32-bit microcontroller and 64-bit Linux capable core designs, with more to come.\n To say I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of open silicon would be a serious understatement. I\u2019ve purposely not mentioned companies and, where possible, specific projects, since these are both topics that I couldn\u2019t do justice here and will save for future posts. Similarly with tools, where there have also been major advances and it would be better to cover these separately.\n   The  ULXS3 FPGA board from Zagreb Makerspace is supported by a FOSS toolchain and capable of booting Linux via a RISC-V soft core.\n I believe that we will continue to see more and increasingly advanced board designs, both from industry and the wider open hardware community. The benefits are clear in terms of education, technology transfer, establishing plarforms and expediting innovation, for example. Not to mention enthusiast and professional engineers alike continuing to up their \u201cspare time\u201d game.\n Meanwhile the wider community continues to grow and whether identifying as being part of the open hardware movement, a maker, an electronics hobbyist or a Raspberry Pi enthusiast, this all contributes to more people getting hands-on with electronics.\n Ten years ago it would have been impossible to predict the size of the opportunity that would be presented by free and open source silicon (FOSSi). Since digital designs generally start out with a text based hardware description that might look like, or even be based upon, a programming language, in hindsight this may now seem blatantly obvious. After all, it means that a lot of the tooling and processes from software development can be reused.\n However, the semiconductor industry was seen as being particularly conservative, making use of eye-wateringly expensive tooling under strict NDA, with fabrication costs of millions of dollars. As with so many things, this was true in part and with some measure of misunderstanding. This aside, the benefits of open silicon are now becoming abundantly clear and certainly in terms of processor and SoC design at least, where the environment has changed in  ...\n  In closing I should note that many important developments and projects will have been omitted. This post is already  much longer than originally intended and there is plenty more to be covered via future posts. This is also partially a view through the lens of the Open Source Hardware User Group, with the original idea being to mark ten years since the first meeting.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:32",

"note_en": "Troubleshooting damaged systems is an essential skill of every SysAdmin, SRE, or DevOps engineer. Every one of us runs into OS-related issues from time to time and it\u2019s better to be prepared when things go terribly wrong.\n It\u2019s especially beneficial to be able to identify and act on the issue quickly to prevent any significant damage. To help with that in this article, we will go over a few common problems that you might encounter as well as ways to gather information, troubleshoot, and solve these issues.\n Note: This article uses  RHEL 8/ CentOS. But, the examples/concepts below can be applied to any Linux distribution.\n  What if you lose the  root password and you don&#39;t have access to a privileged user? If you still have access to the machine, then there is a way to solve this inconvenient situation.\n First, start by rebooting the machine. When the machine starts, hit any key to access the boot menu:\n  In the boot menu, hit  e to edit boot options. Using the arrows, move to the line starting with  linux and append  rd.break. This  breaks the boot process early on.\n Optionally, you can also append  enforcing=0, to pause SELinux enforcing. Next, hit  CTRL+X to let the machine boot.\n  After a few seconds of booting, you should get the shell. At this point, you have access to the system in read-only mode.\n So, to change anything in the system \u2014 like the  root password \u2014 we need to make the filesystem  read-write. We can do that by running  mount -o remount,rw /sysroot.\n The next thing we need to do is enter the root jail using  chroot /sysroot \u2014 this changes the root of the filesystem to  /sysroot instead of  /. This is required so that any further commands we run will be in regards to the  /sysroot directory. Now we can change the  root password using  passwd.\n If you added  enforcing=0 to boot options, you can now hit  CTRL+D (or type  exit) and let the system fully boot. If not, run  touch /.autorelabel to trigger the SELinux system relabel.\n This is needed because changing the password results in  /etc/password having an incorrect SELinux security context. Therefore, we need to relabel the whole filesystem during the next boot (this can take some time, depending on the size of the filesystem).\n  As an alternative solution, you could also access Linux\u2019  debug-shell. This can be done, again, by accessing GRUB during boot and appending  systemd.debug-shell instead of  rd.break.\n When you let the system boot with this option, you will end up in a normal shell session, which isn\u2019t very helpful. If you, however, try to access terminal 9 using  CTRL+ALT+F9, you will open  debug-shell with full  root permissions.\n Here, you can change the password normally. At this point, you can switch back to a normal shell (  CTRL+ALT+F1) and log in.\n You shouldn\u2019t forget to stop the  debug-shell though, as it is a huge vulnerability to the system. You can do that by running  systemctl stop debug-shell.service (you can still switch back to  debug-shell but it will be unresponsive; killed-off).\n  But, even though these are basic tasks, it\u2019s easy to make a mistake that may render your system unbootable. Let\u2019s see how you can solve problems related to unmountable filesystems.\n As with previous solutions, we start by rebooting the machine, accessing the boot menu and editing it, this time appending  systemd.unit=emergency.target. This tells your system to boot into an emergency target instead of the default one (multi-user or graphical).\n When the system boots and we get the shell, we login as root and we again remount the filesystem using  mount -o remount,rw /. Now we can try mounting all filesystems by running  mount -a.\n If there is a problem with mounting a specific filesystem, you might see an error message like  mount: /wrong-mount: mount point does not exist. or  mount /wrong-mount: special device /dev/sdb1 does not exist.. These kinds of issues need to be fixed inside  /etc/fstab:\n  After fixing the issue in  /etc/fstab, run  systemctl daemon-reload, so that  systemd picks up the changes. Now, run  mount -a again. If the issue was indeed fixed, you should see no error (no news, is good news). You can now exit using  CTRL+D and let the system boot normally.\n Aside from a mistyped device or mount point name, you might also encounter issues with VDO (Virtual Data Optimizer) or Stratis, which require extra mount arguments.\n  Another common and easily fixable mistake might be a missing quote when using  UUID=&#34;... to specify the device (use  /etc/fstab syntax highlighting, it can save you a lot of problems).\n  This one is not a life and death kind of a situation, but it can cause a lot of problems, so it\u2019s beneficial to be able to identify it quickly when it happens.\n It\u2019s important to realize that most of the time, SELinux is doing its job correctly. But it might just happen that you are trying to achieve something SELinux doesn\u2019t expect.\n Some of the problems you might encounter may include issues with incorrect file context, for example, after moving a file from one place to another. Sometimes the issue might be with overly restrictive policies (SELinux booleans) or blocked service ports.\n One can troubleshoot all of these problems by first temporarily changing SELinux to non-enforcing mode using  setenforce 0 and retrying the action that wasn\u2019t working previously.\n If the problem was fixed by switching SELinux to non-enforcing mode, then we know that the problem was caused by an SELinux violation.\n Now, if we turn SELinux back on using  setenforce 1, we can try to analyze and fix the violation.\n First, install  setroubleshoot-server using  yum -y install setroubleshoot-server. This troubleshooting server will listen to  /var/log/audit/audit.log and send summary messages to  /var/log/messages.\n Next, to analyze these messages, run  grep sealert /var/log/messages which should give you messages like this:\n  As an example here, I configured  httpd to run on port  8012 which is blocked because of SELinux service\u2019s allowed ports. If we were not aware of this, then it would be quite hard to find the root cause of this issue.\n The output above can help with that. We can see a description of the SELinux violation as well as a command that can help us troubleshoot further, so let\u2019s try it out:\n  This produces a full report of what caused the violation. Including a suggested (not necessarily the most appropriate) fix.\n If you have some experience with SELinux, you might realize that the most appropriate way to fix this issue is to add the relevant port to the SELinux service ( http_port_t). This can be done by running  semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8012.\n This pattern of replicating the violation, looking for  sealert messages in  var/log/messages and viewing the report, and analyzing the report can be applied to any SELinux violation/problem, not just the one example above.\n Alternatively, you can also search directly in  /var/log/audit/audit.log using  ausearch. The specific command you would want to run:  ausearch -m AVC -ts recent. This shows all recent denials.\n The output should look something like this (same information, but a little less user friendly):\n  By default, logs stored in  /run/log/journal are not persisted across system reboots. That might become a problem if you need to debug logs on a crashing system.\n   By uncommenting and changing  Storage to  persistent, we tell  systemd to store all logs in  var/log/journal. Aside from this change, we also need to run  systemctl reload systemd-journald to make sure that the change takes effect.\n Even though this change will persist logs on your system, it won\u2019t keep all of them forever. By default,  journald is configured to not exceed 10% of the filesystem or leave the system with less than 15% of free space.\n Now, to actually inspect the previously-stored logs. First, switch to  root user. Run  journalctl --list-boots. This will give you a list like this:\n  Based on the dates and times, choose from which boot you want to see logs. For example, to view logs from the boot with id  -2 with log level  err or higher:\n  If the logs above are not enough to troubleshoot your issues, then there are other log files to check:\n  Alternatively, if you can\u2019t boot your machine normally, then you can access  emergency.target as shown above, a view logs there in the same way.\n  There is a lot more that can go wrong with a Linux machine than what I have shown in the sections above. These examples/approaches, however, can be applied to a variety of other problems that you might encounter.\n Also, not all of them are life-and-death kind of situations, but it\u2019s always preferable to be able to solve them rather quickly, especially if this problematic machine is a production system.\n Solving most of the issues depends on getting the right information and being able to restore previous configurations, therefore, it\u2019s crucial to always store logs and to backup critical files on your system before modifying them", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:30", "tags":

"note_en": "Know the architecture just as well as anyone else \u2014 and stay current with the tech stack.\n Schedule 1-1s with your direct reports on a weekly basis. Schedule skip-levels on a monthly basis.\n Be customer-focused. Understand how your products are used in the wild. For example, join sales and support calls.\n Set aggressive but achievable goals. Work backwards by focusing on the outcomes you want to achieve.\n     Ensure every report is aware of the top priorities of the team, organization and company.\n  No task is beneath a manager. Get your hands dirty even if it&#39;s not coding:\n  Never skip one on ones. It&#39;s the best platform for receiving and giving feedback. Most teammates value it and usually when they don&#39;t it&#39;s because they haven&#39;t seen one conducted well.\n   Questions to help frame each topic. &#34;On a scale of 1-10 how would you rate:...&#34;\n Additional questions to ask on a less frequent basis: Organization awareness: What do you see as your top 3 priorities this quarter? The team\u2019s? The org&#39;s?\n  See  getting more from your one on ones for more thoughts on effective one on ones.\n  Default to open questions: ask questions starting with  what,  how,  who instead of closed-ended ones like  do,  have,  is to invite conversation and give ownership over a problem. &#34;Why do you think this is the right approach?&#34; is better than &#34;Is this a good idea?&#34;.\n Summarize what the person is saying so you&#39;re both on the same page and are pinpointing the problem. &#34;It sounds like there are two issues, x and y. Which should we focus on first?&#34;\n  Be specific even if it&#39;s positive feedback. &#34;I like the initiative you took to reduce the service&#39;s memory footprint. It shows ownership.&#34;\n Focus on data and not behavior: &#34;I noticed you didn&#39;t address any of the comments made in your last three PRs&#34;\n Talk about why this matters and who it&#39;s affecting: &#34;I mention it because the ticket I assigned you is critical to this quarter&#39;s roadmap&#34;\n   Highlight positive patterns (remember to be specific). &#34;I like it when you take initiative in cleaning up code because it shows ownership.&#34;\n &#34;It&#39;s great to see you teach X about Y so that they&#39;re as proficient as you. That&#39;s a trait of a senior engineer.&#34;\n  How is your team moving the needle? Are you focusing on the right things? How do you know the features you&#39;re building will benefit the customer?\n  What are the company&#39;s top priorities this year? Where should the company be three years from now?\n   If you were to get promoted, who from your team would take your place? What skills or experience does this person need to acquire?\n  Determine if the decision is  reversible vs. irreversible. Irreversible decisions cannot be changed without significant rework. These decisions should takelonger and be documented and discussed. Examples: architecture changes, language decision, data models.\n Whenever there is disagreement, focus on the intended outcome of the decision and make sure the teamis aware of your reasoning. &#34;While database X is better, I want us to standardize on one stack so that it&#39;s easier to maintain.&#34;\n If someone disagrees with a reversible decision, set a date to revisit that decision with the team.Ideally you also have metrics to define the success of that decision. &#34;I understand your concerns. Let&#39;s revisit this in a month and see where we stand.&#34;\n If someone disagrees with an irreversible decision, give them the opportunity to present their case.Regardless, everyone should be aware the decision is ultimately yours and the team needsto  disagree and commit wholly to the decision made.\n Document your decisions so that you can refer to why they were made and the tradeoffs your team faced.\n   Picking up a p2 bug that&#39;s annoying but never seems to become top priority?  \u2705\n    Avoid  shitty brainstorm sessions. Don\u2019t defer decisions to meetings. Make decisions on the spot, communicate it over long-form writing, and use the meeting to discuss it.\n  Always end a meeting with actions, owners and timing, so it&#39;s clear what next steps are.\n For staff meetings, go around the table and ask reports what their biggest concerns are. Many managers want to attend executive staff meetings, as it makes them feel needed and puts them in the know. I made use of this desire by setting a price of admission to the meeting: you had to fess up to at least one thing that was &#39;on fire.&#39;&#34; - Horowitz\n  The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones. They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability. \u2013 Randall E. Stross\n   Owner. Takes ownership of a problem even when it&#39;s not 100% their responsibility; understands the why. &#34;Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside of your area of responsibility. Why was it important? What was the outcome?&#34;\n &#34;Tell me about a time when you made a hard decision to sacrifice short term gain for a longer term goal.&#34;\n Handles ambiguity &#34;Can you tell me about a time when you had to solve an ambitious problem? Why was the problem important?&#34;\n &#34;Can you tell me about a time when you had to make a decision without complete information? What was the situation? What risks did you take? Why did you make the decision you made?&#34;\n  Communicator. Can articulate ideas at different levels. &#34;You mentioned X in your resume. Explain it to me as if I&#39;ve never come across it?&#34;\n  Deep diver. Digs a level deeper to understand what&#39;s happening under the hood. &#34;Tell me about a time you were trying to understand a problem on your team and you had to go down several layers to figure it out.&#34;\n Simplifier. Simplifies problems instead of just hacks at things and adds tech debt. Does the person have a build vs. buy mentality.\n  Short tenure at companies. If a candidate typically stays at companies for less than a year, ask them why. There might be perfectly valid reasons or it might indicate a pattern that the person is difficult to work with.\n Menu of technologies. Resumes that just list technologies used instead of problems solved may indicate person may not be thinking big picture. Also a typical trait of junior engineers.\n Long resumes. More than 2 pages may indicate the person has difficulty distilling what&#39;s important. That being said, there can be culture reasons for long resumes. For example, in some European countries, resumes are encouraged to be long.\n  Having a good onboarding process is crucial to the success of your team and new team members. It ensures team members are contributing as early as possible and are assimilated into your processes and culture.\n An onboarding process is successful if your new team member can contribute a bug fix on their first day of joining.\n      The Pendulum or the Ladder: On the challenges of being a manager who wants to stay technical.\n  What You Do Is Who You Are: Why company culture matters and how to establish one.\n    LifeLabs Learning. Great workshop for new and experienced managers. I learned a lot from it on feedback, coaching and 1-1s.\n How Software Engineers Can Help Interview Their Future Managers: A list of questions for engineers to ask interviewing managers.\n The Feedback Fallacy: focus on replaying positive performance so team members know how to repeat excellence.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:28", "tags": "\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f,playbook,\u51b3\u7b56,team",

"note_en": "We spoke to Rob Pike, the co-author of the Go programming language, about a career spanning four decades, the evolution of Go over the last ten years, and into the future.\n  Evrone: Unlike many developers today, you started your career decades ago at Bell Labs. What\u2019s been the biggest change in the way we develop software that you can think of, given your rare perspective?\n Rob: The scale is much bigger today. Not just of the computers and the network, but the programs themselves. All of Unix version 6 (circa 1975) fits comfortably on a single RK05 disk pack, which has just over 2MB of storage, with lots of room left over for user software. And that was a fine computing environment, or at least seemed like one at the time. Although I can, of course, explain much of the growth, it is astonishing and perhaps not all of it is justified.\n  Evrone: Given the &#34;resistance to change&#34; and &#34;promise of compatibility&#34; ideas, how do you see the next 10 years for the Go programming language and its ecosystem? What is the best future you envision for your technology?\n Rob: Although it&#39;s far from certain, after over a decade of work it looks like a design for parametric polymorphism, what is colloquially but misleadingly called generics, is coming in the next year or two. It was a very hard problem to find a design that works within the existing language and feels as if it belongs, but Ian Taylor invested a phenomenal amount of energy into the problem and it looks like the answer is now in reach.\n How that affects the libraries, the ecosystem, and the community will be fascinating to watch.\n  Evrone: With &#34;gradual typing&#34; being introduced into &#34;dynamically typed&#34; languages and &#34;type inference&#34; into &#34;statically typed&#34;, the line between two is now blurred. What is your opinion on a type system for a modern programming language?\n Rob: I am a big fan of static typing because of the stability and safety it brings.\n I am a big fan of dynamic typing because of the fun and lightweight feel it brings. (As a side note, the big push for integrated unit testing can be credited to languages like Python, which drove testing to demonstrate correctness that the typing system failed to provide.)\n I am not a fan of type-driven programming, type hierarchies and classes and inheritance. Although many hugely successful projects have been built that way, I feel the approach pushes important decisions too early into the design phase, before experience can influence it. In other words, I prefer composition to inheritance.\n However, I say to those who are comfortable using inheritance to structure their programs: pay no attention and please continue to use what works for you.\n  Evrone: Sometimes people use technologies in strange ways. For example, to generate efficient Go code from the high-level Python or Ruby code (yes, we saw that happening!) Over the years, what is the strangest, most creative or amusing Go usage have you seen? What surprised you the most?\n Rob: The biggest surprise was when we learned that Go was being used to write malware. You can&#39;t control who will use your work or what they will do with it.\n  Evrone: You created a number of text editors. What do you think about the Visual Studio code? With technologies like LSP, the line between &#34;text editor&#34; and IDE is blurred now. Do you think software developers need full-featured IDEs like GoLand or using VSCode is fine?\n Rob: I am from a different time, before IDEs, but there was talk early in the project about whether Go needed an IDE to succeed. No one on the team had the right skill set, though, so we did not try to create one. However, we did create core libraries for parsing and printing Go code, which soon enabled high-quality plugins for all manner of editor and IDE, and that was a serendipitous success.\n More recently, we&#39;ve been working hard on an LSP server for Go called gopls, which can be used by any editor or IDE that supports that protocol to improve the experience working with the language.\n Perhaps because of our comfort working with simpler styles of editor, we made sure that one could work comfortably in Go without heavy lifting from the programming environment. An IDE can certainly help, though: most of those I see working in Go today use one, or at least an editor with custom Go support, and get much value from it.\n The question of what style of editor to use is a matter of taste, colored by the culture of the language you work in.\n  Evrone: Software developers tend to label things, such as Dart being a &#34;frontend language&#34;, and C being a &#34;system low-level language&#34;, and so on. How would you term the Go programming language now, given its feature set and usage?\n Rob: Go is a general-purpose programming language. Write whatever you want in it and don&#39;t worry about pinning the language, or any other technology for that matter, to a single problem domain.\n   Rob: The Go experience has taught me that people love to opine about languages, perhaps more than almost any other element of our field. And I have certainly done so myself. But I am tired of the negativity that often results, so now I try to avoid judging things for others.\n There has been a real renaissance in language design over the last 10 years or so, after a period where very few new languages were arriving and succeeding. It&#39;s great to see this and the innovation it brings.\n  Evrone: How does being a Google employee help you develop and guide the Go language? How important is it to be able to ask &#34;tell us how you use our language&#34; on Twitter and get responses from the biggest companies all over the world? Is it just a nice addition or an essential part of language development? How does Google help you?\n Rob: Google has been very generous in its support for the Go project, for which I am very grateful. And of course the language was created because we thought Google needed it; what became called &#34;cloud computing&#34; needed a language with good support for concurrency and easy deployment, among other things. But Google has not directed the project in any significant way. It supports us and lets us do what we think is best.\n Regarding other companies and other users, input from the community is a vital part of understanding how the project, by which I mean the language, compiler, tools, runtime, library, environment \u2014 all of it \u2014 advances.\n  Evrone: After 10 years of Go development and observing how it is used, what can you name the biggest design success and, opposite, biggest design failure for the language? It&#39;s strongest and weakest points, respectively?\n  The technical one is first-class support for concurrent computation. Go is only a decade or so old, but when it was being developed, &#34;threading&#34; and concurrency were not widely appreciated in the programming community. In fact a major reason for creating Go was the difficulty of doing concurrent computation in C++ at the time. It became clear shortly after launch that the concurrency support was a major attraction, one that compensated for what some felt were  ...\n As John Graham-Cumming of Cloudflare says, &#34; I came for the easy concurrency, I stayed for the easy composition&#34;.\n  The political success was the firm  promisemade about compatibility for Go version 1. Once we, and the community, had used Go for a few years, we had a long list of things we wanted to fix, but change is disruptive. So we did a careful program of updates, with the &#34;go fix&#34; command to pull the community along, and once that was done, not only did we stop, we promised to stay stopped. That stability \u2014Go programs written in 2012 will still compile and run perfectly  ...\n  Evrone: What does your work-life balance look like? There are lots of talks about &#34;burn-outs&#34; right now, and the epidemic situation does not help at all. Any hints from your 40-year journey for new generations of developers?\n Rob: The best way to avoid burnout is to do something you truly enjoy in an environment that supports you. I&#39;ve been very lucky in that regard through my whole career, but I realize not everyone is as fortunate. If you&#39;re feeling stressed by work, you should feel free to take a break or change direction, especially in our current situation.\n  Evrone: In hindsight, the popularity of many technologies is credited to so-called &#34;killer apps&#34; that made them popular. Can you name such a &#34;killer app(s)&#34; for the Go programming language and what do you think about such a &#34;killer app&#34; idea as a whole?\n Rob: A few years ago, Danny Berkholz called Go &#34; the emerging language of cloud infrastructure,&#34; and that is no accident. Go was designed by people working at Google to make it easier to write Google-relevant software, in particular network-resident servers. That&#39;s what we call &#34;cloud&#34; today. (Some of the motivation for the design is in my Splash keynote from 2012,  Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering.)\n So although it was gratifying and important to see Docker, Kubernetes, and many other components of  cloud computing written in Go, it&#39;s perhaps not too surprising. Go has indeed become the language of cloud infrastructure.\n  Evrone: What competition do you see for the Go programming language right now and in what area? What is your opinion about Rust with its &#34;no-garbage-collection&#34; ideas and compile-time guarantees?\n Rob: Rust is an intriguing language and I watch its development with interest. Beyond that, I offer no opinion, as I said above.\n  Evrone: Go has just reached 70k stars on GitHub! How do you see different social activities like GitHub, Reddit, Twitter, offline and online conferences, webinars etc influence the language? Are they important for the language&#39;s success or they just reflect it?\n Rob: The people we have met through conferences and social media have been a critical part of the development of Go and all its elements. Many, many contributors have affected the development in positive ways, including the original port to Windows and a number of non-x86 architectures, development of tools and libraries, thoughtful discussions of technical proposals, and much more.\n And it goes the other way, as the Go team reaches out to the community to start discussions, pose questions, and ask for help and guidance.\n One thing that I think is important is to engage with the community as one voice, to speak as a team rather than as individuals. A consistent message is more easily understood.\n  Evrone: How being the author of one of the popular programming languages has changed your life?\n Rob: A correction: I am a co-author, not the author. Ken Thompson and Robert Griesemer started the project with me, and many others contributed massively. So please don&#39;t single me out as &#34;the author&#34;.\n To answer your question, Go has certainly raised my public profile and introduced me to a new and vibrant community but beyond that it hasn&#39;t had much effect. I&#39;ve had a long career with other successes (and innumerable failures).\n  Evrone: Imagine that you have an opportunity to travel back in time and give only one piece of advice to your younger self, at around the time you\u2019ve started to design the Go language spec. What advice would you give to yourself and your colleagues?\n Rob: That&#39;s easy: Ignore the haters. Just listen to the voices that understand and share your goals; they&#39;re the ones to care about. Not everyone agrees with what you&#39;re doing, and that&#39;s OK. But those who engage in advancing what you&#39;re trying to do can be a fantastic source of ideas, energy, and inspiration.\n   At Evrone we pride ourselves on using the best tool for the job, whether that\u2019s  Ruby on Rails,  Python,  Elixir, or, of course,  Go. We strive to stay at the forefront of a range of technologies to be able to provide the best and most appropriate solutions to meet our clients\u2019 needs, and we\u2019re very happy to do all we can to help bring developer communities together.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:21", "tags": "\u7f57\u4f2f,pike,language", "title": "\u7f57\u4f2f\u00b7\u6d3e\u514b\u91c7\u8bbf", "title_en": "Rob Pike

"note_en": "Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve started to see computers take to the street, and lucky for us, it\u2019s been mostly to help us get deliveries or transport us around. These robots are a combination of sensors, compute units, and some form of connectivity. They have personalities, and if you look closely, two cute eyes on  Postmates\u2019 Servethat provide it with stereo vision to navigate the streets. While \u2018Serve \u2019is fully equipped to navigate the streets, even the smartest robots need help from a  ...\n Many of us have taken accessing computers remotely for granted, despite the fact that our production servers are running behind NAT. This has been made possible by SREs who set up public endpoints and bastion hosts, and configure identity-based authentication as we\u2019ve covered in a previous post called   How to SSH properly. But what if your computer is on the move? What happens if you have thousands of them in thousands of cities? How do you provide access for system-level debugging? Which technical  ...\n   We are lucky to have a range of connectivity options available to IoT devices, from high speed LTE connections to new  LoRaWANnetworks. Once connected to a network, the next step is to get access to the device. This post will focus on using SSH by following best practices. Earlier, we \u2019ve outlined how to configure the local ssh-agent to connect to a Bastion Host. This method works well, but unless you start off with a very good naming convention, it becomes much harder to find that one robot  ...\n We \u2019ve taken the best practices of accessing systems and rolled them into our open source project, Teleport. Teleport was designed as a drop-in replacement for OpenSSH, but with a focus on fleets of servers (clusters) where individual nodes such as self-driving trucks (or regular AWS instances) can be located anywhere in the world. The certificate authority and the audit log are deployed in secure networks with only the proxy available to the public internet. Let \u2019s dive a bit deeper into it.  ...\n  While the technical details of delivery robots are often kept under wraps, we know other people have gone to great lengths to be able to  SSH into lamp posts with David\u2019s Awesome  Shadowing Project. The same approach could be applied to self-driving robots using a reverse SSH tunnel, but this method only scales so far, and it requires more than 50 steps to set up.\n A reverse SSH tunnel is an SSH connection initiated by the host (self-driving vehicle) to the proxy. This connection is maintained for as long as the host is online, and if an engineer or an Ansible script wants to connect to the vehicle, they connect to the proxy, which in turn proxies the connection through the tunnel to the host who initiated it.\n We had many  long standing requests to support reverse tunnels, and with OSS Teleport 4.0, we\u2019ve made setting up and managing these reverse tunnels simpler. This can be set up on the node in a couple of quick steps.\n On the robot/lamp post/self-driving truck, the Teleport daemon will be installed and will then dial back to a central Teleport Cluster.\n  Extra configuration options can be set up to add labels and extra supporting metadata to help the operator.\n After connecting to the proxy, the \u2018node\u2019 - in our case a single Raspberry Pi - will show in the Teleport web UI and you can see it by using the CLI client as well:\n \u279c ~ tsh lsNode Name Address Labels--------------------- --------------- --------------------------------------------------Truck-1821 \u27f5 Tunnel arch=Linux, hostname=postmate-serve-342145 uptime=up 0 minutes, \ud83d\udccd=SF \ud83d\udcf6=5G\n I\u2019m now able to SSH into the node using it\u2019s node name.\n   You can ssh into truck-1821 using it\u2019s nodename, meaning you no longer have to worry about IP addresses or having to setup Dynamic DNS at its location.\n Labels can provide both system and location data. This makes managing a large fleet of devices much easier.\n  Moving up in scale, we\u2019ve started to see more computers move to the edge, and some have speculated that this could be the  end of cloud computing. For context, a self driving truck generates 10 gigabytes of data per mile. Some self-driving companies have published how they manage and set up network infrastructure. Cruise has a  great blog for anyone interested in the topic.\n As these systems become more complex, having more compute and extra redundancy running a container-orchestration system makes sense to scale the workloads associated with many gigabytes of data every mile. Yet for operators, these systems can be increasingly difficult to update, debug, and access. Providing access opens Pandora \u2019s box of issues. If robots or humans can access machines, there needs to be an audit trail, approval workflows, and full visibility into what \u2019s been run  ...\n These problems can be easy to solve on a small scale, but become increasingly difficult with 100+ Clusters. Combining a large cluster with hundreds of employees can create extra operational complexity. We have had many users facing the same problem and by using external identity providers combined with a flexible Role Based Access Control (RBAC), They get access quickly and securely.\n In this quick example we\u2019ll show how a fictional company has deployed multiple kubernetes clusters into trucks, yet still require a centralized command and control over the cluster.\n  Teleport provides users two options for connecting to a Kubernetes cluster, it can be run as a proxy outside the cluster or deployed inside a cluster. We recommend deploying inside a cluster, then registering the cluster back to a central root cluster using t rusted clusters.\n All of these features are available in the OSS version of Teleport, using Github as an SSO provider. We\u2019ve more information on our  Kubernetes integration here.\n   No matter where you run a computer, be it a small home lab, a small robot or many thousands of self-driving trucks, these patterns can be used to get secure access quickly. The use of reverse tunnels to access infrastructure can be very powerful when you don\u2019t have full control over the network.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:19", "tags":

"note_en": "Plants are intelligent beings with profound wisdom to impart \u2014if only we know how to listen. And Monica Gagliano knows how to listen. The evolutionary ecologist has done groundbreaking experiments suggesting plants have the capacity to learn, remember, and make choices. That \u2019s not all. Gagliano, a senior research fellow at the University of Sydney in Australia, talks to plants. And they talk back. Plants summon her with instructions on how to live and work. Some of Gagliano \u2019s conversations happened  ...\n Along with forest scientists like  Suzanne Simard and  Peter Wohlleben, Gagliano raises profound scientific and philosophical questions about the nature of intelligence and the possibility of \u201cvegetal consciousness. \u201dBut what \u2019s unusual about Gagliano is her willingness to talk about her experiences with shamans and traditional healers, along with her use of psychedelics. For someone who \u2019d already received fierce pushback from other scientists, it was hardly a safe career move to reveal her personal  ...\n Gagliano considers her explorations in non-Western ways of seeing the world to be part of her scientific work. \u201cThose are important doors that you need to open and you either walk through or you don \u2019t, \u201dshe told me. \u201cI simply decided to walk through. \u201dSometimes, she said, certain plants have given her precise directions on how to conduct her experiments, even telling her which plant to study. But it hasn \u2019t been easy. \u201cLike Alice, [I] found myself tumbling down a rather strange rabbit hole,  ...\n Shortly before the COVID-19 lockdown, I talked with Gagliano at Dartmouth College, where she was a visiting scholar. We spoke about her experiments, the new field of plant intelligence, and her own experiences of talking with plants.\n   You are best known for an experiment with  Mimosa pudica, commonly known as the \u201csensitive plant,\u201d which instantly closes its leaves when it\u2019s touched. Can you describe your experiment?\n I built a little contraption that allowed me to drop the plants from a height of maybe 15 centimeters. So it\u2019s not too high. When they fall, they land in a softly padded base. This plant closes its leaves when disturbed, especially if the disturbance is a potential predator. When the leaves are closed, big, spiny, pointy things stick out, so they might deter a predator. In fact, they not only close the leaf, but literally droop, like, \u201cLook, I\u2019m dead. No juice for you here.\u201d\n  Exactly. It makes no sense for a plant or animal to repeat a behavior that is actually useless, so we learn pretty quick that whatever is useless, you don\u2019t do anymore. You\u2019re wasting a lot of energy trying to do something that doesn\u2019t actually help. So, can the plant\u2014in this case,  Mimosa\u2014learn not to close the leaves when the potential predator is not real and there are no bad consequences afterward?\n  The test is for a specific type of learning that is called habituation. I decided they would be dropped continuously for 60 times. Then there was a big pause to let them rest and I did it again. But the plants were already re-opening their leaves after the first three to six drops. So within a few minutes, they knew exactly what was going on \u2014like, \u201cOh my god, this is really annoying but it doesn \u2019t mean anything, so I \u2019m just not going to bother closing. Because when my leaves are open,  ...\n  You say these plants \u201cunderstand\u201d and \u201clearn\u201d that there\u2019s no longer a threat. And you\u2019re suggesting they \u201cremember.\u201d You\u2019re not using these words metaphorically. You mean this literally?\n Yes, that \u2019s what they \u2019re doing. This is definitely memory. It \u2019s the same kind of experiment we do with a bee or a mouse. So using the words \u201cmemory \u201dand \u201clearning \u201dfeels totally appropriate. I know that some of my colleagues accuse me of anthropomorphizing, but there is nothing anthropomorphic about this. These are terms that refer to certain processes. Memory and learning are not two separate processes. You can \u2019t learn unless you remember. So if a plant is ticking all the boxes and  ...\n Do you think these plants are actually making decisions about whether or not to close their leaves?\n This experiment with  Mimosawasn \u2019t designed to test that specific question. But later, I did experiments with other plants, with peas in particular, and yes, there is no doubt the plants make choices in real decision-making. This was tested in the context of a maze, where the test is actually to make a choice between left and right. The choice is based on what you might gain if you choose one side or the other. I did one study with peas that showed the plants can choose the right arm  ...\n  Oh, yeah, of course. And I\u2019m not talking about electrical signals. We have also discovered that plants emit their own sounds. The acoustic signal comes out of the plant.\n  We call them clicks, but this is where language might fail because we are trying to describe something we \u2019re not familiar enough with to create the language that really describes the picture. We worked out that, yes, plants not only produce their own sound, which is amazing, but they are listening to sounds. We are surrounded by sound, so there are studies, like my own study, of plants moving toward certain frequencies and then responding to sounds of potential predators chewing on  ...\n  You are describing a surprising level of sophistication in these plants. Do you have a working definition of \u201cintelligence?\u201d\n That\u2019s one of those touchy subjects. I use the Latin etymology of the word and \u201c intelligere\u201d literally means something like \u201cchoosing between.\u201d So intelligence really underscores decision-making, learning, memory, choice. As you can imagine, all those words are also loaded. They belong in the cognitive realm. That\u2019s why I define all of this work as \u201ccognitive ecology.\u201d\n Do you see parallels between this kind of intelligence in plants and the collective intelligence that we associate with social insects in ant colonies or beehives?\n That kind of intelligence might be referred to as \u201cdistributed intelligence\u201d or \u201ccollective intelligence.\u201d We are testing those questions right now. Plants don\u2019t have neurons. They don\u2019t have a brain, which is often what we assume is the base for all of these behaviors. But like slime molds and other basal animals that don\u2019t have neural systems, they seem to be doing the same things. So the short answer is yes.\n What you\u2019re saying is very controversial among scientists. The common criticism of your views is that an organism needs a brain or at least a nervous system to be able to learn or remember. Are you saying neurons are not required for intelligence?\n Science is full of assumptions and presuppositions that we don \u2019t question. But who said the brain and the neurons are essential for any form of intelligence or learning or cognition? Who decided that? And when I say neurons and brains are not required, it \u2019s not to say they \u2019re not important. For those organisms like ourselves and many animals who do have neurons and brains, it \u2019s amazing. But if we look at the base of the animal kingdom, sponges don \u2019t have neurons. They look  ...\n   You know, they just say plants do not learn and do not remember. Then you do this study and stumble on something that actually shows you otherwise. It \u2019s the job of science to be humble enough to realize that we actually make mistakes in our thinking, but we can correct that. Science grows by correcting and modifying and adjusting what we once thought was the fact. I went and asked, can plants do Pavlovian learning? This is a higher kind of learning, which Pavlov did with his  ...\n There\u2019s an emerging field of what\u2019s called \u201cvegetal consciousness.\u201d Do you think plants have minds?\n What is the mind?  [Laughs] You see, language is very inadequate at the moment in describing this field. I could ask you the same question in referring to humans. Do you think humans have a mind? And I could answer again, what is the mind? Of course, I have written a paper with the title \u201cThe Mind of Plants\u201d and there is a book coming called  The Mind of Plants. In this context, language is used to capture aspects of how plants can change their mind, and also whether they have  ...\n Let me ask the question a different way. Do you think plants have emotional lives? Can they feel pain or joy?\n It\u2019s the same question. Where do feelings arise from, and what are feelings? These are yes or no questions, usually. But to me, they are yes  and no. It depends on what you mean by \u201cfeeling\u201d and \u201cjoy.\u201d It also depends on where you are expecting the plant to feel those things, if they do, and how you recognize them in a human way. I mean, plants might have more joy than we do. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t know because we\u2019re not plants.\n We have only talked about this from the scientific perspective, which is the Western view of the world. But I \u2019ve also had a close relationship with plants from a very different perspective, the indigenous world view. Why is that less valuable? And when you actually do explore those perspectives, they require your experience. You can \u2019t just understand them by thinking about them. My own personal experience tells me that plants definitely feel many things. I don \u2019t know  ...\n  You\u2019ve studied with shamans in indigenous cultures and you\u2019ve taken ayahuasca and other psychoactive plants. Why did you seek out those experiences?\n I didn \u2019t. They sought me. So I just followed. They just arrived in my life. You know, those are important doors that you need to open and you either walk through or you don \u2019t. I simply decided to walk through. I had this weird series of three dreams while I was in Australia doing my normal life. By the time the third dream came, it was very clear that the people that I was dreaming of were real people. They were waiting somewhere in this reality, in this world. And  ...\n  The first time I went, I found this place that was in my dream. It was just exactly the same as what I saw in my dream. It was the same man I saw in my dream, grinning in the same way as he was in my dream. So I just worked with him, trying to learn as much as I could about myself with his support.\n This was a local shaman whom you identify as Don M. And there was a particular plant substance, a hallucinogen, that you took.\n I did what they call a \u201cdieta, \u201dwhich is basically a quiet, intense time in isolation that you do on your own in a little hut. You are just relating with the plant that the elder is deciding on. So for me, the plant that I worked with wasn \u2019t by itself a psychedelic in the normal way of thinking about it. But of course, all plants are psychedelic. Even your food is psychedelic because it changes your brain chemistry and your neurobiology all the time you eat. Sugars,  ...\n  When you \u2019re trying to describe this to people haven \u2019t had the experience, it probably doesn \u2019t make much sense because this kind of knowledge requires your participation. I don \u2019t hear someone talking to me as if from the outside, talking to me in words and sound. But even that is not correct because inside my head it does sound exactly like a conversation. Not only that, but I know it \u2019s not me. There is no way that I would know about some of the information that  ...\n Early this summer I met a friend for breakfast at a restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. While waiting for him to arrive I spent some time staring at a lot next door\u2014a vacant lot, as the spaces are called, but also...  READ MORE\n Are you saying these plants had specific information to tell you about your life and your work?\n Yeah, I mean, some of the plants tell me exactly how wrong I was in thinking about my experiments and how I should be doing them to get them to work. And I \u2019m like, \u201cReally? \u201dI \u2019m scribbling down without really understanding. Then I go in the lab and try what they say. And even then, there is a part of me that doesn \u2019t really believe it. For one experiment, the one on the Pavlovian pea, I was trying to address that question the year before with a different plant.  ...\n Do you think you are really encountering the consciousness of that plant? Maybe your imagination has opened up to see the world in new ways, but it\u2019s all just a projection of your own mind. How do you know you are actually encountering another intelligence?\n If you had this experience of connecting with plants the way I have described \u2014and there are plenty of people who have \u2014the experience is so clear that you know that it \u2019s not you; it \u2019s someone else talking. If you haven \u2019t had that experience, then I can totally see it \u2019s like, \u201cNo way, it must be your mind that makes it up. \u201dBut all I can say is that I have had exchanges with plants who have shared things about topics and asked me to do things that I have  ...\n  I\u2019m not a medical scientist, but I\u2019ve been given information by plants about their medical properties. And these are very specific bits of information. I wrote them in my diary. I would later check and I did find them in the medical literature: \u201cThis plant is for this and we know this.\u201d I just didn\u2019t know. So maybe I\u2019m tapping into the collective consciousness.\n What do you do with these kinds of personal experiences? You are a scientist who\u2019s been trained to observe and study and measure the physical world. But this is an entirely different kind of reality. Can you reconcile these two different realities?\n I think there are some presuppositions that a scientist should just explore the consensus reality that most of us experience in more or less the same way. But I don \u2019t really have a conflict because I find this is just part of experimenting and exploring. If anything, I found that it has enriched and expanded the science I do. This is a work in progress, obviously, but I think I \u2019m getting better at it. And in the writing of my book, which for a scientist  ...\n  Steve Paulson is the executive producer of Wisconsin Public Radio\u2019s nationally syndicated show \u201cTo the Best of Our Knowledge.\u201d He\u2019s the author of Atoms and Eden: Conversations on Religion and Science.

The decision came in response to two patents \u2014 one for a food container and the other for a flashing light \u2014 that were created by an AI system called DABUS.\n Among  the USPTO\u2019s arguments is the fact that US patent law repeatedly refers to inventors using humanlike terms such as \u201cwhoever\u201d and pronouns like \u201chimself\u201d and \u201cherself.\u201d The group behind the applications had argued that the law\u2019s references to an inventor as an \u201cindividual\u201d could be applied to a machine, but the USPTO said this interpretation was too broad. \u201cUnder current law, only natural persons may be named as an inventor in a patent application,\u201d the agency concluded.\n \u201cUnder current law, only natural persons may be named as an inventor in a patent application.\u201d\n The patents were submitted last year by the  Artificial Inventor Project. Along with the patents submitted to the USPTO, the team also submitted documents to the UK\u2019s Intellectual Property Office (IPO) and the European Patent Office (EPO). The  IPO and  EPO have already ruled that DABUS, which was created by AI researcher Stephen Thaler, cannot be listed as an inventor based on similar legal interpretations. The  USPTO asked the public for opinions on the topic last November.\n The Artificial Inventor Project is not arguing that an AI should own a patent, just that it should be listed as an inventor,   MIT Technology Review notes. It argues that this might be necessary when hundreds or even thousands of employees have contributed code to a system, like IBM \u2019s Watson supercomputer, before the computer itself then goes on to solve a problem. If no human was involved closely enough with an invention to claim credit for it, then the group fears it may be impossible to patent  ...\n The project also argues that allowing AI to be listed as an inventor would incentive innovation since the value these machines are adding would be more clearly recognized. \u201cIf you make a point of recognizing how valuable a machine has been in the creative process, that machine will inevitably become more valuable,\u201d the Artificial Inventor Project\u2019s Ryan Abbott  told the  Financial Times last year.\n Unless the law changes in the future, however, artificial intelligence is likely to continue to be seen as an inventing tool, rather than an inventor.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:09", "tags":

"note_en": "Git branches are a powerful tool to organize ongoing work as part of a team and ensure that software delivery stays effective. If you use git today, there are high chances that you&#39;re either using the famed git-flow or the more recent GitHub flow. Both these workflows depend extensively on using branches effectively \u2014 and naming a new branch is something many developers struggle with.\n There are so many conventions and formats that are recommended, but at times following these conventions becomes painful in itself. Herein we outline a simple git branch naming convention that\u2019s easy to follow, and takes care of most common use-cases.\n   Most conventions recommend leading the branch name with prefixes like  hotfix-,  feature-,  chore-, or some other variant of the categorization of tasks. Practically, if you are using an issue tracker, you \u2019re tagging the category of the task in the issue tracker anyway \u2014in addition to much more additional context. Using these categorical prefixes, this, seems redundant at least and requires additional decision-making when naming branches at worst. Leading with the issue tracker ID is convenient,  ...\n The issues created in the issue tracker, in most cases, are used for tracking the team\u2019s progress. It becomes easy to correlate the relevant working branch with each task \u2014 especially when each developer is working on many issues at the same time.\n Searching and filtering is much easier in the issue tracker. Once you know your issue number, it becomes easy to find the branch using auto complete in the local git tree.\n \u279c super-secret-project git: (master ) git checkout 72&lt;TAB&gt;722-add-billing-module -- Apply suggestions from code review720-submodules-rc 722-add-billing-module 723-fix-highlighting 728-fix-homepage-css\n  While using the issue tracker ID itself is sufficient to identify a unique branch in a project in most cases, there could be chances that some more nuance is needed. For example, there could be multiple branches needed to work on one issue, possibly by different people.\n Use a short, actionable descriptor of the task after the issue ID. This makes the branch name recognizable, distinct, and easy to search for in case you don\u2019t have the issue ID handy. Make sure that the descriptor is concise, but descriptive enough to give you an idea of what\u2019s going on in the branch.\n  This is a little opinionated, but hyphens make for good separators in branch names. You could use an underscore,  _, too. The key is to be consistent, though.\n  And that\u2019s it \u2014 just these three rules to keep in mind. No complex naming schemes or rules to follow make it easy for everyone in the team to stay on the same page. Naming things can be difficult at times, and it\u2019s helpful to have simple heuristics. In a world where almost everyone is using some sort of issue tracking anyway, this approach makes git branch naming as easy as possible.\n DeepSource helps you automatically find and fix issues in your code during code reviews, such as bug risks, anti-patterns, performance issues, and security flaws.

"note_en": "The move to innovate at speed and scale is stressing software quality and exposing the limitations of testing.\n  Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 testing in all its forms is inseparable from the software delivery supply chain. Tests and static analysis are essential to software development pipelines, and this holds true for both traditional and cloud-native applications.\n  We are in the midst of  unprecedented times, and in an era of disruption where long-established financial institutions are facing competition from 7 year old startups. Companies are under pressure to move fast to remain viable, even those that have been around for over 100 years, and they need to move twice as fast to defend their position and remain competitive.\n Over a decade ago, when Test-Driven Development (TDD) was introduced, it promised to improve productivity and quality. Even for teams that don\u2019t follow it religiously, but treat it more as a north star. Since then, release cycles shortened, CI/CD is no longer a buzzword, and new companies that develop pipeline automation products \u2013  I\u2019m looking at you GitLab \u2013 are mature enough to IPO.\n To reiterate this point, testing is perhaps more relevant than ever, but when moving fast is table stakes, relying on traditional tests alone for preventing errors is no longer enough. Even though tests are irreplaceable, critical errors still reach production, while customers are waiting on the seamless experience they were promised (right before their  application breaks).\n The bottom line?   Testing is no longer enough. And in this post, we\u2019ll outline how we got here and what the experts have to say on that.\n  In the context of digital business, standing still is the equivalent of losing. Lewis Carroll said it best in \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d which became the basis for what\u2019s called the  \u201cRed Queen Hypothesis:\n  Apart from being a nice anecdote from a great book, the Red Queen Hypothesis originates from an evolutionary concept, proposing that organisms must constantly adapt in order to survive, while pitted against other organisms in a constantly changing environment.\n The same idea can be applied to a business setting, demonstrating why every company is rushing to automate their CI/CD workflows. The second-order effect here is how it applies to testing. When you\u2019re releasing code faster and faster, increasing your development velocity, how can you prevent errors from being promoted? And how can you fix them fast if they do occur?\n The safety measures for a road car going 70mph are very different from those of a F1 car going over 200mph, so as you automate your CI/CD workflows, testing needs to evolve as well.\n  According to Google Cloud\u2019s DevOps Research &amp; Analysis (DORA)  State of DevOps report, change failure rates (i.e. the percentage of changes in production that result in degraded service and require remediation)\u00a0  can go up to 60% of all new code releases.\u00a0 For elite performers, the failure rate can be kept under 15%, but since this addresses only known errors and is based on self-reporting of engineers (not customers), the actual rates might even be higher.\n The difference between low performers and elite performers is quite high, giving the elite an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d in their ability to innovate and move fast. This explains the results we\u2019ve seen from big tech companies like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Google, although even they are not free from errors.\n A key driver behind this is the ability to release smaller changes at a higher frequency \u2013 but that\u2019s not the only difference. While all companies test in one form or another, how they do it and what they look for varies greatly.\n During a recent live panel, we discussed this issue with the co-hosts of  DevOps Paradox,  Darin Pope, a DevOps Consultant that\u2019s known for making the complex simple, and  Viktor Fracic, a Principal Software Delivery Strategist, Developer Advocate and a published author. Together with  Eric Mizell, OverOps VP of Solution Engineering.\n An on-demand recording of that conversation, including takeaways for balancing speed and quality with Continuous Reliability,  is available here.\n Below are three key takeaways from that conversation that illustrate why traditional testing is not sufficient:\n  Viktor Fracic: \u201cCode coverage means nothing. I don\u2019t understand why people are still obsessed with code coverage. It\u2019s not really about how many tests you have, but the quality of those tests. I\u2019ve seen companies that have close to 100% code coverage but have meaningless tests that don\u2019t prove anything.\n \u201cThose types of metrics to me are very misleading. It\u2019s easy to have 95% test code coverage, but having tests that really matter, having them drive your design, and detect things that are hard to detect, that\u2019s what\u2019s hard. Code coverage doesn\u2019t serve much of a purpose if the tests themselves are not really well done.\u201d\n  Darin Pope: \u201cThis is day-to-day life for most people, I would rather have an error happen in production and go-to-market fast, than build something for 5 years to get it out the door when all market opportunity is lost. I\u2019d rather see people move fast and be comfortable with failing.\u201d\n Viktor Fracic:\u201cIf you do develop for five years and then put it in production, it \u2019s still going to fail. Until you put it in production you don \u2019t really know how it will behave with real users. We \u2019re just trying to get as close to being stable before we put it in production, but once it \u2019s there then we can figure out what \u2019s going on and react quickly to solve problems. But the whole idea that you will be testing, testing, testing and then you say, yes now it \u2019s going to work  ...\n Eric Mizell:\u201cI don \u2019t want to drop in production and fail miserably. But I do want to be able to have the people and processes in place to fix it, because you want to adopt a move fast/fix fast mindset. I want to get it out there fast, because I need to move quicker in today \u2019s world. In a cloud world a new company can spend a day and they could compete with me with something I \u2019ve been working on for five years. I need to figure out how to move fast and continue to move forward  ...\n  Viktor Fracic: \u201cI would say that this was true a long time ago. It\u2019s just that now we are admitting it. And everybody knows that we never deploy stable code in production that never fails or doesn\u2019t have any problems. Every single company in the world 20 years ago was receiving notifications from their users, this or that doesn\u2019t work, and then you need to fix it. We knew all of this, now we\u2019re just admitting the reality.\u201d\n Eric Mizell: \u201cI\u2019ve actually heard a company say that they try to do risk assessment on how risky it is to lose customers and revenue versus getting the software out there. They need new features. It\u2019s a balance. I don\u2019t think anyone has the perfect balance there but you see it happening a ton and it goes back to the notion of I want to be able to move fast/fix fast. How do I come back from a failure is the true challenge.\u201d\n  As developers, we are great at writing code, but inherently limited in the ability to foresee where it will break down later. The task of detecting software issues, either early in testing or later in prod, and gathering information on them should be automated if we ever want to achieve the move fast/fix fast vision.\n That\u2019s the mission we\u2019re tackling here at  OverOps, so if you\u2019re running mission-critical Java or .NET applications, send me a note at alex [at] overops.com, and I\u2019d be happy to chat!\n The on-demand recording of this panel, including takeaways for balancing speed and quality with Continuous Reliability, is available  here.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:56", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,\u4eca\u5929,longer,\u6d4b\u8bd5,testing", "title": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0d\u518d\u8db3\u591f", "title_en": "Why Testing Is No Longer Sufficient for Today\u2019s Software Delivery Pipelines", "transed": 0, "url": "https://blog.overops.com/why-testing-is-no-longer-sufficient-for-todays-software-delivery-pipelines/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "\u4eca\u5929", "longer", "\u6d4b\u8bd5", "testing"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "33f0b4c5652196e1d12aadca9fead569.jpg", "infoid": 1000218, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6458\u8981\u4e00\u65e6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u4e86\u89e3\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u76f4\u90fd\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5462\uff1f\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e86\u89e3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u4ed6\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u662f\u5426\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf918\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5806\u6808\u6ea2\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5047\u8bbe\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6f5c\u5728\u5730\u5e72\u6270\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u95e8\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u4ece\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u6765\u770b..\u3002\n\u4fc4\u52d2\u5188\u5dde\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u76f8\u53d8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u751f\uff0c\u4fc4\u52d2\u5188\u5dde\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u3002\n\u5bc6\u6b47\u6839\u5927\u5b66\u3001\u52a0\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u5723\u5df4\u5df4\u62c9\u5206\u6821\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bc6\u6b47\u6839\u5927\u5b66\u3001\u5bc6\u6b47\u6839\u5927\u5b66", "note_en": "Abstract Once a programmer knows one language, they can leverage concepts and knowledge already learned, and easily pick up another programming language.
