The Consumer Technology Association has announced that it intends to give exhibitors a way to showcase their products \u201cboth physically in Las Vegas and digitally.\u201d\n The stakes are high for CES. It\u2019s one of the largest conventions held each year in Las Vegas, responsible for bringing a huge number of visitors to the city, with around 175,000 attendees last year. The Las Vegas Convention Center, the primary venue where the event is held, is scheduled to complete a $980 million expansion just in time for next year\u2019s show. And while consumers may know CES as the event where new TVs, cars, and other gadgets are announced, it also remains an important venue for meetings between retailers, manufacturers, and all the companies in between.\n  The CTA is promising new health policies for the show. The group intends to \u201cregularly clean and sanitize spaces\u201d and offer \u201csanitization stations.\u201d It also plans to widen aisles and seats to increase distancing, limit \u201ctouch points\u201d by using tech like mobile payments, and provide on-site health services. The CTA says it\u2019ll look into doing temperature scans and that it plans to issue \u201cbest practices,\u201d like wearing a mask \u2014 though it doesn\u2019t say if they\u2019ll be required.\n Plans to hold CES in-person were posted to the convention\u2019s website on May 7th, though  The Verge only noticed them today. The plans don\u2019t appear to have been covered widely before now.\n Other companies have begun to cancel large conferences happening around the end of 2020 out of concern that the pandemic will still pose a threat.  Blizzard canceled November\u2019s BlizzCon, and Microsoft announced that  it\u2019ll only hold digital events until July 2021.\n At this point, there\u2019s no telling whether it\u2019ll be safe to hold a large-scale event in January. And even if health officials believe it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s another question entirely whether people will feel safe enough to attend. CES packs tens of thousands of people into densely filled convention halls and encourages them to touch new products, exchange business cards, and schedule smaller meetings. Even if the pandemic is over, people may not be ready for that.\n Correction June 3rd, 2:40PM ET:  The CTA announced it would hold CES in-person on May 7th, not today, as this story initially stated.

"note_en": "A group of Amazon employees are suing the company, alleging it mandated unsafe working conditions in one of its fulfillment centers that led to the spread of COVID-19 and deaths resulting from the disease.\n &#34;This case is about Amazon&#39;s failures to comply with New York law and state and federal public health guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic at the JFK8 facility,&#34; the complaint ( PDF) reads, alleging, &#34;the company has relied on purposeful miscommunication with workers, sloppy contact tracing, and the culture of workplace fear it has instilled at JFK to ensure it can maintain productivity while reducing costs, even if that means workers come to work sick and cannot engage in proper hygiene, sanitizing, or social distancing while at work in order to stay healthy.&#34;\n At least one worker at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island has died of COVID-19 so far, and several others have fallen ill. As recently as this past weekend, employees at the facility were receiving additional newly confirmed cases at the facility. One of the plaintiffs in the suit alleges that after she contracted the novel coronavirus at work in the warehouse, &#34;she awoke to find her cousin with whom she lived dead in their bathroom&#34; after he developed COVID-19 symptoms. She requested paid quarantine leave from the company under the terms of New York law, the suit says, but Amazon failed to pay her.\n Aside from that back pay, however, the plaintiffs do not seek any financial damages for past harm, according to the complaint. &#34;All they seek is an order requiring Amazon to comply with public health guidance to prevent more harm in the future.&#34;\n A former Amazon employee, Christian Smalls, spoke out about the unsafe conditions at JFK8 back in March and organized an employee walkout in protest. Amazon  promptly fired him. A few days later, reporters at Vice Motherboard obtained  an internal memo about Smalls&#39; firing, in which Amazon senior leadership determined to make Smalls the face of the entire organization movement and disparage him while doing so.\n &#34;If possible, make him the face of the entire union/organizing movement,&#34; the company&#39;s general counsel, David Zapolsky, wrote in the memo. &#34;He\u2019s not smart, or articulate, and to the extent the press wants to focus on us versus him, we will be in a much stronger PR position than simply explaining for the umpteenth time how we\u2019re trying to protect workers.&#34;\n Amazon  also fired several other employees who spoke out about working conditions in the company&#39;s warehouses amid the COVID-19 crisis.\n The Office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James in late April  began an investigation into the health and safety practices at Amazon&#39;s New York warehouses. &#34;The information so far available to us raises concerns that Amazon&#39;s health and safety measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are so inadequate that they may violate several provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act,&#34; James&#39; staff wrote in an April 22 letter.\n &#34;Many workers are fearful about speaking out about their concerns following the termination of Mr. Smalls&#39; employment,&#34; the letter added. &#34;This is a particularly dangerous message to send during a pandemic, when chilling worker speech about health and safety practices could literally be a matter of life and death.&#34;\n An Amazon spokesperson in a statement to Ars stressed that the company follows the guidance of applicable health authorities, including the CDC and WHO in addition to state regulators. &#34;We are saddened by the tragic impact COVID-19 has had on communities across the globe, including on some Amazon team members and their family and friends,&#34; the spokesperson said, adding that

"note_en": "Right now, there is a pain deeply etched in the soul of our nation and in the hearts of millions. To\u00a0stand together, we must stand up for one another, and recognize the fear, hurt, and outrage rightly provoked by the senseless killing of George Floyd and a much longer history of\u00a0racism.\n  That painful past is still present today \u2014 not only in the form of violence, but in the everyday experience of deeply rooted discrimination. We see it in our criminal justice system, in the disproportionate toll of disease on Black and Brown communities, in the inequalities in neighborhood services and the educations our children\u00a0receive.\n  While our laws have changed, the reality is that their protections are still not universally applied. We\u2019ve seen progress since the America I grew up in, but it is similarly true that communities of color continue to endure discrimination and\u00a0trauma.\n  I have heard from so many that you feel afraid \u2014 afraid in your communities, afraid in your daily lives, and, most cruelly of all, afraid in your own skin. We can have no society worth celebrating unless we can guarantee freedom from fear for every person who gives this country their love, labor, and\u00a0life.\n  At Apple, our mission has been and always will be to create technology that empowers people to change the world for the better. We\u2019ve always drawn strength from diversity, welcomed people from every walk of life to our stores around the world, and strived to build an Apple that is inclusive of\u00a0everyone.\n  But we must do more. We commit to continuing our work to bring critical resources and technology to underserved school systems. We commit to continuing to fight the forces of environmental injustice \u2014 like climate change \u2014 which disproportionately harm Black communities and other communities of color. We commit to looking inward and pushing progress forward on inclusion and diversity, so that every great idea can be heard. And we\u2019re donating to organizations including the Equal Justice Initiative, which challenge racial injustice and mass\u00a0incarceration.\n  To create change, we have to reexamine our own views and actions in light of a pain that is deeply felt but too often ignored. Issues of human dignity will not abide standing on the sidelines. To the Black community \u2014 we see you. You matter and your lives\u00a0matter.\n  This is a moment when many people may want nothing more than a return to normalcy, or to a status quo that is only comfortable if we avert our gaze from injustice. As difficult as it may be to admit, that desire is itself a sign of privilege. George Floyd\u2019s death is shocking and tragic proof that we must aim far higher than a \u201cnormal\u201d future, and build one that lives up to the highest ideals of equality and\u00a0justice.\n  In the words of Martin Luther King, \u201cEvery society has its protectors of status quo and its fraternities of the indifferent who are notorious for sleeping through revolutions. Today, our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of\u00a0change.\u201d\n  With every breath we take, we must commit to being that change, and to creating a better, more just world for\u00a0everyone.", "posttime": "2020-06-05 00:05:47", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Today\u2019s launch didn\u2019t include any human passengers, but it did fly that next big batch of Starlink broadband internet satellites, as mentioned. Those will join the other Starlink satellites in low Earth orbit, forming part of a network that will eventually serve to provide high-bandwidth, reliable internet connectivity, particularly in underserved areas where terrestrial networks either aren\u2019t present or don\u2019t offer high-speed connections.\n This launch included a test of a new system that  SpaceX   designed in order to hopefully improve an issue its satellites have had with nighttime visibility from Earth. The test Starlink satellite, one of the 60, has a visor system installed that it can deploy post-launch in order to block the sun from reflecting off of its communication antenna surfaces. If it works as designed, it should greatly reduce sunlight reflected off of the satellite back to Earth, and SpaceX will then look to make it a standard part of its Starlink satellite design going forward.\n  Part of this launch included landing the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket used for the launch, which has already flown previously four times and been recovered \u2013 that makes this a rocket that has now flown five missions, and today it touched down safely once again on SpaceX\u2019s drone landing barge in the ocean so it can potentially be used again.\n  SpaceX will also be attempting to recover the two fairing halves that form the protective nose cone used during launch at the top of the rocket to protect the payload being carried by the Falcon 9. We\u2019ll provide an update about how that attempt goes once SpaceX provides details.\n Tomorrow, June 4, actually marks the 10-year anniversary of the first flight of a Falcon 9 rocket \u2013 between this reusability record, and the much more historic first human spaceflight mission earlier this week, that\u2019s quite the decade.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 22:51:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "starlink,spacex,\u536b\u661f", "title": "SpaceX\u518d\u53d1\u5c0460\u9897Starlink\u536b\u661f", "title_en": "SpaceX launches 60 more Starlink satellites", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/spacex-launches-60-more-starlink-satellites-and-records-a-reusability-record-for-a-falcon-9-booster/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["starlink", "spacex", "\u536b\u661f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7675a24a9a44203f7a03d26799ea7822.jpeg", "infoid": 1005150, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u8981\u8f9e\u53bb\u5728Facebook\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u591a\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u7279\u6717\u666e\u603b\u7edf\u4e00\u76f4\u4eab\u53d7\u7740Facebook\u793e\u533a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u4f8b\u5916\uff1b\u4ed6\u4e00\u904d\u53c8\u4e00\u904d\u5730\u53d1\u5e16\u2026\u2026", "note_en": "I'm resigning from my job at Facebook.

"note_en": "A full autopsy report on George Floyd, the man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police last month, reveals that he was positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The 20-page report also indicates that Floyd had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system at the time of his death, although the drugs are not listed as the cause.\n  The  report released Wednesday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner&#39;s Office is dated May 25, the same day Floyd died. In video taken by bystanders, Floyd, 46, is shown repeatedly pleading that he cannot breathe as he is held down with a knee on his neck by former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin, with three other officers present. The incident has sparked nationwide \u2014 and even worldwide \u2014 protests.\n    The autopsy report concludes the cause of death was &#34;cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.&#34; That conclusion, death due to heart failure, differs from the one reached by an independent examiner hired by the Floyd family, which listed the cause of death as &#34;asphyxiation from sustained pressure.&#34;\n    The medical examiner&#39;s report does not mention asphyxiation. Preliminary results from that report were released publicly on Monday. According to prosecutors, who filed charging documents last week, the results &#34;revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.&#34;\n  The medical examiner&#39;s report also details blunt-force injuries to the skin of Floyd&#39;s head, face and upper lip, as well as the shoulders, hands and elbows and bruising of the wrists consistent with handcuffs.\n  Signed by Dr. Andrew M. Baker, it says Floyd had tested positive for the novel coronavirus on April 3. A post-mortem nasal swab confirmed that diagnosis. The report notes that because a positive result for coronavirus can persist for weeks after the disease has resolved, &#34;the result most likely reflects asymptomatic but persistent ... positivity from previous infection.&#34;\n  In addition to fentanyl and methamphetamine, the toxicology report from the autopsy showed that Floyd also had cannabinoids in his system when he died.\n  Floyd also had heart disease, hypertension and  sickle cell trait \u2014 a mostly asymptomatic form of the more serious sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder that primarily affects African Americans.\n  Also on Wednesday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison  announced upgraded charges of second-degree unintentional murder against Chauvin. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison.\n  &#34;To the Floyd family, to our beloved community, and everyone that is watching, I say: George Floyd mattered. He was loved. His life was important. His life had value. We will seek justice for him and for you and we will find it,&#34; Ellison said in announcing the new charges on television.\n  Three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time on Wednesday with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n A previous version of this story incorrectly said the charge of second-degree murder against Derek Chauvin carries a maximum penalty of 12.5 years in prison. In fact, that charge carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 21:59:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co is developing an electric van aimed at business users, joining a growing list of carmakers planning EVs for the same segment which includes customers such as Amazon.com Inc and United Parcel Service Inc, five people familiar with the plans told Reuters.\n  That multibillion-dollar strategy could enable GM, Ford Motor Co and at least two EV startups to build and deliver more electric vehicles at a time when consumer demand for battery-powered models is still a small fraction of overall industry sales, while targeting a potentially lucrative market segment that Tesla Inc has yet to address.\n GM\u2019s plan to develop an electric van has not previously been reported. The No. 1 U.S. automaker did not confirm the van, but has said it plans to introduce at least 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023, in a variety of body styles including sedans, trucks and crossovers.\n Suppliers familiar with such plans at GM and Ford told Reuters the Detroit automakers, which count trucks and commercial vehicles among their most profitable businesses, \u201cdon\u2019t want to leave the door open for Tesla\u201d as they did in consumer passenger cars.\n Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director of fleet maintenance and engineering, said the package delivery firm believes electric vans have the potential to disrupt the commercial market.\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to be similar to what the Model 3 has done for the consumer market,\u201d Phillippi said, referring to Tesla\u2019s small near-luxury electric sedan. \u201cNow all of a sudden, we\u2019re off to the races.\u201d\n The GM van \u2013 code-named BV1 \u2013 is due to start production in late 2021, the sources said. It is believed the BV1 van will share some components with GM\u2019s future electric pickups and SUVs, including the automaker\u2019s new Ultium advanced battery system. It is expected to be assembled alongside the electric trucks at GM\u2019s Detroit-Hamtramck plant.\n GM is considering whether to offer the electric van through its traditional truck brands - Chevrolet and GMC - or market it under a different brand such as Maven, the sources said. GM\u2019s first electric pickup truck, due in late 2021, will be sold by GMC dealers under the Hummer brand.\n In a statement, GM said it is \u201ccommitted to an all-electric future and is implementing a multi-segment, scalable EV strategy to get there. At this time, we do not have any announcements to make regarding electric commercial vehicles.\u201d\n The GM electric van project is aimed at an important segment of the emerging EV market \u2013 commercial delivery vehicles. For established players, this is a hugely profitable business segment driven by cost of ownership, not fancy tech or star power. It is also a segment in which Tesla and its high-profile CEO, Elon Musk, lack an entry to compete for sales and CO2 credits, which allow automakers to offset the sale of non-electric vehicles including high-margin pickups and SUVs.\n \u201cBuyers of commercial vans want reliability and not necessarily a flashy brand name,\u201d said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. \u201cThe reduced maintenance and fuel use of electric vehicles become very attractive to a business customer, where the current limitations of EVs make the price premium less attractive to individual consumers.\u201d\n In February, Ford said it would introduce an electric version of its Transit van for model year 2022. \u201cThe most critical bet we will be making over the next several years will be our commercial vehicles,\u201d Ford\u2019s chief operating officer, Jim Farley, told Reuters at the time.\n Ford also is an investor in Michigan-based startup Rivian, which is scheduled to begin building the first of 100,000 mid-size electric vans for Amazon next year.\n Amazon rival UPS has commissioned 10,000 mid-size electric vans from British startup Arrival, which is backed by Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor Co and its sister company Kia Motors Corp.\n  The combined value of the Amazon and UPS contracts with Rivian and Arrival is estimated at $4 billion or more.\n And more players in the segments will likely follow, including Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG (  VOWG_p.DE) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, said Samit Ghosh, chief executive of the Americas for consulting and engineering firm umlaut.\n \u201cThe delivery vans is a volume not to be underestimated,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not just call it a niche segment.\u201d", "posttime":

"note_en": "Cyber-attacks against anti-racism organisations shot up in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a leading provider of protection services says.\n Cloudflare, which blocks attacks designed to knock websites offline, says advocacy groups in general saw attacks increase 1,120-fold.\n   DDoS attacks - short for Distributed Denial of Service - are a relatively simple cyber-attack tool, in which the attacker tries to flood a website or other online service with so many fake &#34;users&#34; that it cannot cope.\n  The effect is that it gets knocked offline for people trying to access information or services.\n  Cloudflare says that after Mr Floyd&#39;s death and the ensuing violent clashes between police and protesters, it saw a noticeable jump in the amount of requests it blocked - an extra 19 billion (17%) from the corresponding weekend the previous month.\n  The problem was particularly acute for certain types of organisations. One single website belonging to an unnamed advocacy group dealt with 20,000 requests a second.\n Anti-racism groups which belong to Cloudflare&#39;s free programme for at-risk organisations saw a large surge in the past week, from near-zero to more than 120 million blocked requests.\n  Attacks on government and military websites were also up - by 1.8 and 3.8 times respectively.\n It follows  a sudden swell of interest in the &#34;hacktivist&#34; collective Anonymous, which has said it will support the protesters, and threatened to target the police in the city of Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed. The group has often used DDoS attacks in the past.\n  &#34;As we&#39;ve often seen in the past, real world protest and violence is usually accompanied by attacks on the internet,&#34;  Cloudflare said in a blog post written by its chief executive and chief technology officer.\n &#34;Unfortunately, if recent history is any guide, those who speak out against oppression will continue to face cyber-attacks that attempt to silence them.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-06-04 21:32:29", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f51\u7ad9,racism,\u7ec4\u7ec7", "title":

"note_en": "Three weeks ago, Elena*, a Krakow-based customer support agent for digital banking startup Revolut, dialled in to her weekly catch-up call with her team leader. She expected them to discuss an ongoing project. Instead, a few seconds into the call, she was told she was being fired.\n Elena was asked to pick between two documents: one said she was being terminated for underperformance, the other, a \u201cmutual agreement\u201d, offered her a small severance and stated she was choosing to leave the company of her own accord. She was shocked: two weeks earlier, she says her manager had assured her that her job was safe and that she was performing well. \u201cI thought maybe I should speak to another institution for legal advice because I am a foreigner,\u201d Elena says. \u201c[But] they said I had no additional time and that I have 30 minutes to make this decision.\u201d\n  Fearful for her career, Elena ended up choosing the mutual agreement. Elena is one of more than 50 employees in Poland and Portugal who it is claimed were pressured into leaving their jobs at Europe\u2019s fastest growing fintech startup since the coronavirus pandemic struck. Their numbers are not included in the recent  62 redundancies announced by Revolut \u2013 because they technically agreed to leave. Revolut says redundancies represented three per cent of its staff. \u201cIt was pretty stressful. In my friend\u2019s team two people were fired two hours before their shift [with no warning],\u201d says a former staff member who was dismissed in May.\n Current and former Revolut employees say staff were coerced into accepting terminations, even though the company had no legal grounds to fire them. Some say this happened after the company heavily pushed a voluntary scheme where staff were asked to sacrifice part of their salary in exchange for shares in the company.\n  Revolut confirmed that a small number of employees left the business for underperformance reasons, which are valid grounds for dismissal in Poland. These employees were advised of the reason for their exit orally and in writing in a meeting with their line manager and human resources manager.\n The Krakow office in Poland is at the heart of Revolut\u2019s operations: it is the company\u2019s biggest office, and employs more staff than its London headquarters. Alongside centres in Lithuania and Portugal, it is the main support and compliance hub for Revolut, where everything from customer complaints to compliance work are dealt with by almost 1,000 staff. To service clients in several different languages, Revolut hires people from around the world and gives them residency permits. Before Revolut staff started working from home in response to the pandemic, at the Krakow office you could find people from a list of countries as diverse as Italy, Chile and India, on starting average net salaries between 3,500 and 4,000 zlotys a month (\u00a3700 to \u00a3800).\n  Now, some of the employees allegedly pressured to leave have been left stranded in a foreign country without a job or health insurance in the middle of a pandemic. While the Polish government has expanded residency permits until the \u201cemergency period\u201d ends, people from outside the European Union risk losing their visas once this special provision is over.\n &#34;I had some interviews but employers do not sound very promising due to the current crisis and unwillingness to provide documents for residence permits,&#34; Elena says. \u201cThe most unexpected thing for me is that my health insurance will terminate during this Covid situation. I don\u2019t know what I would do if I get this virus.\u201d\n On April 14, a couple of weeks before Elena was fired, Revolut announced that it was trying to reduce potential redundancies through cost-cutting plans, despite having secured $500 million in new funding, pushing its valuation to $5.5 billion in February 2020. The company says these plans included a reduction in outsourcing costs and an \u201centirely voluntary\u201d salary sacrifice scheme, where any employee could exchange part of their wages for twice their value in Revolut share options. The shares in the scheme are valued at $121.4015 per share - the value of Revolut\u2019s last fundraising round.\n  According to a company presentation from May 11, over 60 per cent of staff opted into the scheme, which Revolut says will deliver around $900,000 in savings each month over the next 12 months. While some staff in Krakow and Porto say they were happy to participate, others say they felt pressured into opting into the scheme.\n  \u201cPeople are scared all the time that someone will fire them. I spoke with a few guys and they told me they gave away ten per cent at least because they were afraid that in the end they will look for the employees that didn\u2019t give the money back,\u201d says a source within the HR department. \u201cObviously they don\u2019t say we won\u2019t fire [if you participate in the scheme] but in the end the message was a bit like that. If you sacrifice money we\u2019ll stop firing people.\u201d\n In a message sent to the 495-strong customer support team on Slack shortly after the salary sacrifice scheme was announced, head of support Inna Grynova urged them to participate. \u201cSo far, almost 20 per cent of our employees globally have submitted their sacrifices. In Support we\u2019ve gathered only 44 submitions [sic] (out of 495 employees) which is a very small number,\u201d the message read.\n \u201cOur goal is to use SSS [salary sacrifice scheme] as an alternative to the need of employees redundancy and other cost cuts. So the success of SSS depends on all of us. If it won\u2019t be enough, unfortunately we would need to go for the other steps, which we\u2019ll try to avoid. The positive impact of SSS can be achieved only when we work together.\u201d\n Other managers and team leaders sent similar messages in the days prior to the closing of the scheme. Documents sent to staff say that as long as it is in line with local laws, employees can sacrifice as much as 100 per cent of their salary. But in at least one of Revolut\u2019s main jurisdictions this scheme could be illegal, according to Filipe Lamelas, labour lawyer and assistant researcher at Portugal\u2019s Collaborative Laboratory for Labour, Employment and Social Protection. \u201cAccording to Portuguese law, base salary cannot be reduced even by agreement.\u201d\n  A Revolut spokesperson admits that Portuguese law prohibits reductions in the \u201cbase salary\u201d, and the company is \u201cstill reviewing the best way to offer a scheme that offers an equivalent benefit to salary sacrifice in Portugal\u201d.\n There is no suggestion that salary sacrifice was undertaken in Portugal illegally. Those that opted into the scheme were not necessarily saving their own jobs or their colleagues\u2019. Decisions to fire staff had already been drawn up before these cost-cutting plans were announced, one source within the HR department claims. Days before the scheme was unveiled, a list with dozens of names of people that were to be fired was drawn up by heads of departments and senior HR executives, they say.\n In Poland, workers say they were told by their line managers and HR that they were underperforming and would be terminated if they didn\u2019t leave voluntarily. But in Portugal mutual agreements stated that dismissals were a result of a reduction of 40 per cent in the group\u2019s activity and a 30 per cent excess in staff numbers. By getting employees to voluntarily leave, Revolut has avoided launching a group redundancy consultation, that, among other things would give employees the right to severance payments and the chance to be offered alternative roles within the company. \u201c[Mutual agreement] is better for Revolut because they can\u2019t go to labour court [employment tribunal],\u201d says the source from the HR department. \u201cThe way they prepare the terminations are so bad that if someone would go to court Revolut would lose,\u201d the source claims.\n WIRED reviewed the testimony of employees and the documents given to them by Revolut with lawyers in Poland and Portugal who said the company could have acted unlawfully.\n Polish employment lawyer Grzegorz Ilnicki says the termination agreement given to Elena was not only missing key details required by law, but that forcing her to choose between that document and a \u201cmutual agreement\u201d could be illegal. \u201cThere are some verdicts in the Supreme Court in Poland that presenting these two documents to the same worker could be a criminal threat. The threat is that if you don\u2019t sign the mutual agreement we will terminate you because you are a bad worker,\u201d he says. A Revolut spokesperson says the company has respected local labour law requirements at all times.\n  In Portugal, the company asked employees to quickly sign mutual termination agreements without informing them that they had no legal obligation to do so. One employee says a colleague was blocked from accessing her email and other associated work accounts during a meeting with her manager and HR. Since she would only sign the mutual agreement if the terms were improved, the company was forced to reactivate her accounts the next day so she could continue working.This kind of activity could be considered harassment, according to Lamelas. Revolut says that all exits in Portugal were carried out legally.\n This wouldn\u2019t be the first time Revolut\u2019s practices have risked falling foul of employment law.  Last year it was revealed that the company was asking applicants for business development and PR roles to recruit customers for free in order to have a chance at getting a job. Andrius Biceika, the then head of business development and one of the executives that used this hiring practice, has since been promoted to interim chief people officer, the most senior HR role within the company, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n The company has also been criticised for an  almost religious adherence to key performance indicators (KPI) for every role, from HR, to recruitment and compliance.\n As coronavirus hit global travel, one of the key sectors that Revolut relies on \u2013 daily active people using the app \u2013 fell from 1.3 million on February 1 to 0.9 million on March 28, according to company documents seen by WIRED. This translated to less activity for many of the teams operating out of Krakow, Porto and Vilnius, including, but not limited to, the customer support team.\n Despite this drop in activity, the KPIs that were expected from employees were not dropped to match it. People that worked in the customer support department were still expected to do 60 chats a day to hit their target, even though at times no customers were online making requests to the support team. Some departments, like the compliance department\u2019s \u201cknow your customer\u201d team even had their KPIs increased, a former employee claims.\n  A Revolut spokesperson says its \u201cperformance management systems\u201d aim to support its employees in \u201cachieving their best at work and offer training and guidance\u201d. They add that employees \u201cmay leave the business if they are not making progress in their role\u201d.\n As lockdowns have started to ease in some European cities, activity amongst Revolut users has picked up again, returning to 1.1 million daily active people on May 9. That has meant that the workload has increased again for the customer support team, with a backlog of around 1,000 people regularly being left queuing for assistance, according to screenshots seen by WIRED.\n \u201cNow we are always with a backlog because a lot of people were fired,\u201d the Porto-based customer support agent says. \u201cI think they did things too quickly. And why? Because they don&#39;t care about people.\u201d\n            Get The Email from WIRED, your no-nonsense briefing on all the biggest stories in technology, business and science.

it&#39;s possible to predict an individual\u2019s patterns of thoughts and feelings by scanning their brain in an MRI machine as they perform some mental tasks.\n But a new analysis by some of the researchers who have done the most work in this area finds that those measurements are highly suspect when it comes to drawing conclusions about any individual person\u2019s brain.\n Watching the brain through a functional MRI machine (fMRI) is still great for finding the general brain structures involved in a given task across a group of people, said Ahmad Hariri, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University who led the reanalysis.\n \u201cScanning 50 people is going to accurately reveal what parts of the brain, on average, are more active during a mental task, like counting or remembering names,\u201d Hariri said\n Functional MRI measures blood flow as a proxy for brain activity. It shows where blood is being sent in the brain, presumably because neurons in that area are more active during a mental task.\n The problem is that the level of activity for any given person probably won\u2019t be the same twice, and a measure that changes every time it is collected cannot be applied to predict anyone\u2019s future mental health or behavior.\n Hariri and his colleagues reexamined 56 published papers based on fMRI data to gauge their reliability across 90 experiments. Hariri said the researchers recognized that \u201cthe correlation between one scan and a second is not even fair, it\u2019s poor.\u201d\n They also examined data from the brain-scanning Human Connectome Project -- \u201cOur field\u2019s Bible at the moment,\u201d Hariri called it -- and looked at test/retest results for 45 individuals. For six out of seven measures of brain function, the correlation between tests taken about four months apart with the same person was weak. The seventh measure studied, language processing, was only a fair correlation, not good or excellent.\n Finally they looked at data they collected through the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study in New Zealand, in which 20 individuals were put through task-based fMRI twice, two or three months apart. Again, they found poor correlation from one test to the next in an individual.\n The bottom line is that task-based fMRI in its current form can\u2019t tell you what an individual\u2019s brain activation will look like from one test to the next, Hariri said. The new analysis, appears June 3 in Psychological Science\n \u201cThis is more relevant to my work than just about anyone else\u2019s!\u201d Hariri said, his voice rising. \u201cThis is my fault. I\u2019m going to throw myself under the bus. This whole sub-branch of fMRI could go extinct if we can\u2019t address this critical limitation.\u201d\n Hariri has been using fMRI data as part of a long-term study of 1,300 undergraduate Duke students. By combining brain scans, genetic testing and psychological assessments, Hariri is searching for biomarkers of individual differences in the way people process thoughts and emotions, such as why one person comes away from a traumatic event with PTSD or depression and another does not.\n \u201cWe can\u2019t continue with the same old \u2018hot spot\u2019 research,\u201d Hariri said. \u201cWe could scan the same 1,300 undergrads again and we wouldn\u2019t see the same patterns for each of them.\u201d\n One possible solution to the reliability problem, using existing technology, would be to collect data for a full hour or longer in the scanner, not just five minutes. Hariri also said developing new tasks from the ground up with the explicit purpose of reliably measuring individual differences in brain activity is another strategy. In the meanwhile, Hariri and his team have shifted their focus to MRI measures of brain structure, which are highly reliable.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t known these issues of reliability, but this paper brings them together more sharply,\u201d said Russell Poldrack, the Albert Ray Lang Professor of Psychology at Stanford University, who had a 15-year-old fMRI paper among those that were reanalyzed.\n \u201cThis is a good wakeup call, and it\u2019s a marker of Ahmad\u2019s integrity that he\u2019s taking this on,\u201d said Poldrack, who was not involved in the meta-analysis but said he has had suspicions about fMRI reliability for a few years now.\n Connectivity mapping \u2013 seeing how areas of the brain are connected to address a task more than just what areas are active \u2013 is going to be the way forward, Poldrack predicted. Hariri agreed that identifying patterns of activity throughout the brain rather than in one or two areas may improve reliability.\n In the meantime, the sociology behind a dramatic debunking of a scientific tool is going to be interesting to watch, Hariri and Poldrack both said.\n \u201cThere\u2019s three things you can do,\u201d Poldrack said. \u201cYou can just up and quit, you can stick your head in the sand (and act as if nothing has changed), or you can dig in and try to solve the problems.\u201d\n This analysis was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation.

It highlighted how it can surface in atypical symptoms such as anger. I learned to recognise and work on my own anxiety. It also lead me to recognise anxiety in others. Soon I realised this does not only affect other people but also organisations and processes. Let me introduce you to anxiety driven development.\n   Fear and anxiety produce similar responses. Fear is based on a concrete threat. Whereas anxiety is fuzzier and more vague. Fear driven development is graspable which makes it easier to talk about it.\n As an engineer it could look like this: You\u2019re afraid of pushing your code because you could break the build. Or you shy away of touching a method because you fear shipping a bug.\n If you are a product manager you might try to squeeze that extra feature into a release because you fear that you won\u2019t be able to close a new customer otherwise.\n  But anxiety runs deeper than this. Anxiety becomes more of an underlying current. Here are the most common anxiety driven development patterns I have observed,\n  Your product is driven by the fear of losing. Losing market share, customers or ratings. You are driven to keep up with whatever the competition does. So you go out of your way to get every feature built that your competitors ship.\n As a product manager you might push a feature request to the top of the backlog with every release announcements of your competitors. You can even call that  agile because you\u2019re adapting to change quickly, right? Unfortunately what you\u2019re doing is destabilising your development flow and hinder the long term success of your product. You will always be at least one step behind, always trying to close the gap. This will choke all innovation because who has time to take additional risks when you\u2019re barely keeping pace?\n  Play to win instead. The treatment for this form of anxiety is to  develop a strong unique selling proposition (USP). If you can differentiate yourself from your competition you will not be reeled into the fruitless thought pattern of  playing not to lose. Do not try to differentiate yourself by price alone. This is a very weak USP, just waiting for the next competitor to undercut you, speeding up the race to the bottom. Also it creates almost  no customer loyality.\n  If you\u2019re anxious your business is falling behind but you can\u2019t quite pinpoint why you will act in a continued state of emergency. You will chase quick wins. This might calm the the anxiety for a moment but it won\u2019t last long. It\u2019s possible to make a team stay late or rally the whole company behind you for an initiative. Once. But the more often you cry wolf the less likely it is you get the desired response. If your body is being continuously flooded with stress hormones it will render it incapable of responding to stressful situations adequately. The same goes for your organisation.\n If you push your team every quarter to add a last minute feature for the opportunity of a featuring in a prominent partner store your team will anticipate this and instead already create buffers beforehand. The emergency response will create a fatigue which will appear in the form of demotivation, inflated estimates and non-commitment. All of this hurts the true output, fuelling your anxiety even more.\n  To break out of such a vicious circle  practice saying no. Take a step back and craft an inspiring, authentic vision. Let this vision influence an  actionable strategy. You can then break your strategy down into a  rolling wave plan with more details of the near future. This gives you clarity on the current work while not losing the bigger picture. Ultimately you will be less swayed to jump onto every potential  quick win.\n  Anxiety can make you feel out of control. What\u2019s a natural response to this? You try everything to regain control. But that perceived control can in truth be an overly bureaucratic process which slows down your product development, once again feeding your anxiety.\n How could that look like? You might be creating or working on tickets that resemble a full-blown requirements sheet, specified to the very last detail. At the same time every idea has to go through various stages of approval (until it\u2019s rejected). This is  extremely damaging for motivation.\n  To get out of such anxiety driven behaviours you need trust. Trust your own market research and strategy. And most of all trust your team. Empower the team to be the experts to achieve the product\u2019s vision and let them self organise.\n  Anxiety is widespread and on the rise,  not just during a pandemic.

This is the highest monthly average value ever recorded, and is up from 414.7 ppm in May of last year.\n    Carbon dioxide levels are now the  highest they\u2019ve been in human history, and  likely the highest in 3 million years. The last time there was this much CO2 in the atmosphere, global average surface temperatures were  significantly warmer than they are today, and sea levels were 50 to 80 feet higher.\n  The continuing rise in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere may sound surprising in light of recent findings that the coronavirus pandemic, and the associated lockdowns, had led to a  steep drop in global greenhouse gas emissions, peaking at a 17 percent decline in early April.\n    But the total amount of CO2 that winds up in the atmosphere is driven not only by human emission levels, but also through processes on the land surface (especially forests) and in the oceans that fluctuate on a yearly basis.\n  According to a Scripps news release announcing the findings, CO2 emissions reductions on the order of 20 to 30 percent would need to be sustained for six to 12 months in order for the increase in atmospheric CO2 to slow in a detectable way.\n  \u201cThe buildup of CO2 is a bit like trash in a landfill. As we keep emitting, it keeps piling up,\u201d said Ralph Keeling, who directs  Scripps\u2019 carbon dioxide monitoring program, and whose late father, Charles David Keeling, began measurements at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii in 1958.\n  \u201cThe crisis has slowed emissions, but not enough to show up perceptibly at Mauna Loa. What will matter much more is the trajectory we take coming out of this situation,\u201d he said.\n    In the 1960s, the annual growth rate was about 0.8 ppm per year. It doubled in the 1980s, and eventually climbed to 2.4 ppm per year during the last decade. Multiple lines of evidence show the cause of this increase is greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, said Pieter Tans, who leads NOAA\u2019s Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases Group.\n    The Scripps researchers found that the average atmospheric CO2 concentration for May 2020 was 417.16 parts per million. Using different calculations than the Scripps team, NOAA researchers found the peak monthly value was slightly lower, at 417.1 ppm.\n  The annual high typically occurs in May before CO2 levels temporarily ebb as trees and plants in the Northern Hemisphere absorb vast quantities of the planet-warming gas during the summer growing season. Though CO2 levels exhibit a seasonal cycle, the overall upward trend is clear.\n  The rate of increase from last May to this May was slower than it was in the comparable to 2018 to 2019 period, but natural factors such as El Ni\u00f1o events in the tropical Pacific Ocean and changes in terrestrial carbon sinks, such as forests, can have a large influence on this from year to year, Tans said.\n    El Ni\u00f1o events can contribute to drought and extreme heat in large areas of the world, Tans says, noting they can weaken the ability of forests and other lands to soak up carbon dioxide, leading to a higher natural contribution to atmospheric CO2 levels.\n  The combination of record fossil fuel use and mild El Ni\u00f1o conditions between May 2018 and 2019 can explain the above average increase in atmospheric CO2 of 3.5 ppm that year.\n  Wildfires and deforestation can add to the increase in atmospheric CO2 as well, though their influence ultimately is overwhelmed by the global burning of fossil fuels.\n  According to Rob Jackson, an emissions expert with Stanford University and the Global Carbon Project, emissions from wildfires were up in 2019 and 2020, contributing to the May peak, as was Brazil\u2019s land emissions due to deforestation and  burning.\n    This year\u2019s May CO2 peak marked an increase of about 2.4 ppm compared to a year ago. The 2010 to 2019 average rate of increase is precisely the same at 2.4 ppm per year, according to NOAA. The decline of El Ni\u00f1o over the last year may help explain why the increase in the past year was not as large as the previous, Tans said.\n  Because atmospheric levels of CO2 are cumulative, they will continue to increase until net emissions are cut to zero. They will not decrease until human activities and natural ecosystems are removing more greenhouse gases than is going into the air.\n  Molecules of CO2, a global warming agent, can remain in the atmosphere for up to 1,000 years.\n  Scientists warn that we\u2019re on course to reach 450 ppm by mid-century, where levels would need to stop increasing to have a decent chance of meeting the goals in the Paris climate agreement, which seeks to limit climate change to well below 3.6 degrees (2 Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2100.\n  Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech, says the new findings underscore the need to act now. \u201cIt is a reminder that climate change is not on pause in any way, shape or form,\u201d she said.\n  Keeling says it would take a sustained drop in emissions, rather than a sudden decline related to the coronavirus pandemic, to show up more clearly in measurements of atmospheric CO2. \u201cWhat really matters here is setting a new trajectory,\u201d he said.\n  Jackson, who conducted the  analysis of emissions declines due to the pandemic with colleagues from the Global Carbon Project, said the new findings are not surprising given how the planet\u2019s carbon cycle works.\n  \u201cThis result is disappointing but expected in an atmosphere that is both big and variable,\u201d he said via email.\n  \u201cWe estimated that fossil carbon emissions dropped 8 percent [during] January through April, from 12 billion metric tons in 2019 to 11 billion in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cA billion tons is a lot, but not so much that we can find it with statistical confidence in a noisy signal.\u201d\n  It\u2019s important not to take the wrong message from the current finding, Jackson emphasized. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that the effect of covid-19 on emissions is trivial or that climate progress is impossible. It isn\u2019t. Short-term changes in anything are hard to detect in something as big as the atmosphere.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-06-04 21:02:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u5386\u53f2,co2", "title": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0e\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6392\u653e\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u5730\u7403\u7684\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u6c34\u5e73\u4ecd\u521b\u5386\u53f2\u65b0\u9ad8", "title_en": "Earth\u2019s CO2 levels hit record high, despite coronavirus-related emissions drop", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/06/04/carbon-dioxide-record-2020/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u5386\u53f2", "co2"]}]
