"note_en": "Linus Torvalds first released his Git version control software 15 years ago, on April 7, 2005, in an effort to foster a more creative spirit in Linux kernel development. Since then, Git\u2019s role in software development has emerged well beyond its roots as a version control system and a software repository. It\u2019s become a cornerstone of how software is developed today by distributed teams and open source developers around the world.\n In this  The New Stack Makers podcast, we spoke with three Git thought leaders about Git\u2019s roots, its present context and its future. We learned that despite its present-day success, Git\u2019s future is not certain.\n   For many, the possibilities that Git offers are exciting, both on an individual and macro level when many parties must collaborate on a project, particularly for CI/CD. You can use Git to upload personal pet projects, such as whether you want to share a simple code sample or just documentation for something not necessarily related to software. For a large enterprise, developer teams can collaborate on application development concurrently whether they are scattered around the world or  ...\n  However, it is easy to forget why Git and version control have become so universally adopted. Tracing back at its beginning 15 years ago, Davis described Git\u2019s evolution beyond concepts of locking and trust for source code control systems.\n \u201cSafety is important, but we thought the way that we could achieve safety was through rigorous control. And now we \u2019ve kind of opened our minds and said, \u2018Well, actually, are those two things? Do we? Are they mutually exclusive? Can I actually loosen the controls and still be safe?&#39; \u201dDavis said. \u201cI think we \u2019ve proven that the answer is \u2018yes. \u2019But we couldn \u2019t have done that with the old source code control systems because the primitives weren \u2019t there, things like \u2026having the full  ...\n Branching is also a key function that helps explain Git \u2019s massive adoption. Warner explained the significance of branching by relating it to how Google docs work now. You can see which users have made changes to the document previously in different versions. The prospect of making changes to a document without knowing the history of previous versions is scary. \u201cBranching and Git is really, really important to where we were 15 years ago, and cheap, easy branches revolutionized the  ...\n However, all of the great things Git offers and its prevalence in the development community does not necessarily mean it is necessarily locked in to meet all computing and IT needs of the future. Stateless data management is a good example.\n \u201cVersion controlling data is one of those things that is still very, very hard. And I think now with the advent of ML and AI, it \u2019s getting more and more important, \u201dSijbrandij said. \u201cWhat is the data we use to train it? What is the input and output data and what is the output data and version of the model that ran on it? \u201dhe said. \u201cI see a lot of tooling, but I think there \u2019s also something fundamental on the file level that needs to change \u2026We need better version control for data  ...\n Indeed, Warner said the file system in a Git context must change, particularly its abstraction, \u201cand how we think of it. It\u2019s not just the versioning of the data itself, but it\u2019s how it\u2019s applied and particularly at scale at large sizes is going to become a real issue,\u201d Warner said. \u201cSo, the concepts, if they can be applied, I think are going to be interesting. And I hope somebody does advance it because that is still kind of a pain point for the industry.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:47:23", "tags": "\u73b0\u5728,git", "title":

"note_en": "Millions of people gave their email addresses to Quibi, JetBlue, Wish and other companies \u2014 and those email addresses got away.\n They ended up in the hands of advertising and analytics companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter, leaving the people with those email addresses more easily targeted by advertisers and able to be tracked by companies that study shopping behavior, according to  a report published on Wednesday.\n The customers unwittingly exposed their email addresses when signing up for apps or clicking on links in marketing emails, said the researcher Zach Edwards, who runs the digital strategy firm Victory Medium. In the report, he described the giveaway of personal data as part of a \u201csloppy and dangerous growth hack.\u201d\n The practice of making customers vulnerable to tracking by allowing their personal data to be passively collected by third parties is nothing new, Mr. Edwards said in an interview, but it has gained traction despite efforts to improve online privacy protections.\n \u201cThis hack used to be something that only very niche and sophisticated developers understood,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now the entire ad-tech industry understands it.\u201d\n  Privacy experts have  raised concerns about leaks of personal information for  more than a decade, said Arvind Narayanan, a computer science professor at Princeton University who has  studied data mining. Careless web programming practices lead to some accidental giveaways of large hunks of personal information, he said, but other leaks are intentional.\n \u201cThere\u2019s an industry of ad targeting that tries to connect people\u2019s online and offline activities,\u201d Mr. Narayanan said. \u201cPeople may not want all of their interests and activities and purchases to be tied together in one uber-profile that connects every dot, but that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. These leaks are one clue to the puzzle of how companies are able to create that all-encompassing profile.\u201d\n Mr. Edwards, a contributor  to a recent study that examined potential privacy violations by dating services  like Grindr and OkCupid, wrote in the new report that one of the \u201cmost egregious\u201d leaks involved  Quibi, a short-form video platform based in Los Angeles that is run by the veteran executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman.\n Quibi went live on April 6, long after new data privacy regulations went into effect in  Europe and  California.\n \u201cIn 2020, no new technology organizations should be launching that leaks all new user-confirmed emails to advertising and analytics companies,\u201d Mr. Edwards wrote. \u201cYet that\u2019s what Quibi apparently decided to do.\u201d\n People who downloaded the Quibi app were asked to submit their email addresses. Then they received a confirmation link. Clicking on the link made their email addresses available to Google, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, according to the report .\n Quibi said in a statement on Wednesday that data security \u201cis of the highest priority\u201d and that \u201cthe moment the issue on our webpage was revealed to our security and engineering team, we fixed it immediately.\u201d\n Mr. Edwards said customers were probably unaware of leaks at Wish, an e-commerce platform where hundreds of millions of email addresses were most likely exposed starting in 2018. When users clicked on links in marketing emails from the company, their email addresses were shared with Google, Facebook, Pinterest, PayPal and others, he wrote.\n Wish strengthened its data protection measures after hearing from Mr. Edwards this year, the company said in a statement. But it criticized his report as \u201coff the mark,\u201d noting that the email addresses were encoded and went to service providers that Wish uses for advertising and sales support.\n A spokesman for Wish added that Google and other advertising and analytics companies \u201chad no reason\u201d to crack the encoded email addresses. \u201cIn any event,\u201d the spokesman said, \u201cit certainly is not a \u2018breach\u2019 to provide a service provider with such encoded information.\u201d\n According to Mr. Edwards\u2019s report, customer data also leaked out of JetBlue, which said in a statement that it was taking Mr. Edwards\u2019s concerns seriously and would review his findings.\n Other companies, including The Washington Post, had limited leaks, according to the report. The email addresses of people who had unsubscribed to newsletters from The Post ended up with several analytics companies, Mr. Edwards wrote, and the publication addressed the issue shortly after it was notified.\n The coronavirus pandemic has reignited concerns over weak privacy protections.  The many tracking apps that have been used to trace carriers of Covid-19 may open the door to  more surveillance. The Zoom videoconferencing service, newly popular with people stuck at home, has struggled with  a slew of privacy and security problems.\n Mr. Edwards urged companies to reach out to platforms that might have collected their customers\u2019 email addresses and ask that the information be scrubbed.\n \u201cSome of the largest companies doing this pretend like it doesn\u2019t happen, so they don\u2019t have to deal with the deletion process,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cThey ignore people who ask.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:47:12", "tags":

"note_en": "A quick note: we originally planned to release a new stable release of Flutter today, but we discovered a   crashing bug  in final testing that we wanted to fix before releasing. We have a fix checked into the codebase, but we want to allow a little more bake time to be certain we didn\u2019t introduce a new regression. We now plan to release the stable release next week. Thanks to several folks who reported the issue and worked with us to reproduce it.\n  Almost a year ago, we shared our first technical preview of Flutter\u2019s support for targeting the web. Our vision for Flutter is to provide a portable toolkit for building beautiful experiences wherever you might want to paint pixels on the screen. Given the pervasiveness of the web, it\u2019s a natural place to experiment with Flutter, but its characteristics are different from a mobile platform like Android and iOS.\n Having Flutter code run in a web browser opens up an array of intriguing possibilities, including:\n Providing an easy path for developers to take their existing mobile apps to the web, whether as a fully-fledged app, PWA, or as a low-friction preview of the installed experience.\n Enabling desktop app developers to build once and make a late-bound decision about whether to ship as a high-performance installed desktop app and/or a friction-free ephemeral web app.\n Tools like  DartPad and  CodePen that let you quickly experiment with Dart code, seeing the results in real time without needing to install anything locally on your machine.\n Flutter was built to be unapologetically app-centric in its framework and API choices. We believe it is a distinct offering that contributes to the broad tapestry of web development. If we are successful at our goals, Flutter\u2019s web support will provide a framework that takes full advantage of all that the web platform offers, allowing developers to build beautiful rich interactive applications that feel completely at home in a browser.\n  Ampstor is a powerful example. The team set out to build an editing tool for building  AMP Stories, a new format that helps content providers create visual narratives for mobile devices. Here\u2019s what they had to say about using Flutter on the web:\n \u201cAs a startup that helps customers build highly-branded experiences, it\u2019s critical that we can get to market quickly and iterate based on customer feedback. We chose Flutter because it gave us the freedom to focus on the product, not the platform itself. We\u2019re delighted with our experiences so far and our customers love the app we\u2019ve built.\u201d\n Our early goal with web support was to prove the basic hypothesis that the Flutter framework could be ported to the web. Last summer, we unforked the web code back into the main framework, leading to a single codebase that supports mobile and web (as well as desktop!). Our focus has since shifted to delivering fast, jank-free performance using the latest web platform advances, improving behavioral consistency across Flutter target platforms, and rooting out and fixing scenarios that don \u2019t yet  ...\n With that in mind, here is an update on what the team has been working on since web support landed in the beta channel last December.\n   Fans of  Progressive Web Apps will be delighted to know that the default Flutter template for web apps now includes support for the core features needed for an installable, offline-capable PWA app:\n  Notice that this looks like a normal desktop app, but it\u2019s really a Flutter web app that\u2019s been installed into the browser as a PWA. You can see the difference with the added icon buttons in the title bar, which exposes Chrome functionality. Flutter-based PWAs can be  installed in the same way as any other web-based PWA; the settings signaling that your Flutter app is a PWA are provided by  manifest.json, which is produced by  flutter create in the  web/ subfolder.\n PWAs are supported on major mobile and desktop browsers and are just one of the ways we are investing in  bridging the gap between the capabilities of the native platform and the web.\n This remains a work in progress, so please give us feedback if you see something that doesn\u2019t look right.\n  When we launched beta, only a few plugins supported the web. Since then, we\u2019re seeing  more plugins add support for the web platform, thanks to some great contributions from the community, such as:\n  While we plan on extending a few more popular Google-authored plugins for the web ourselves, we largely depend on the community to help bring web support to existing packages. To help you get started, we have published a couple of articles explaining  how to write a web plugin.\n  Debugging is a crucial step in the development process, and is one of the areas of active development for creating a richer Flutter web experience. If you use VS Code to develop Flutter applications, you\u2019re probably expecting the full set of debug capabilities to be available to you, including evaluating expressions in the debug window, using the watch functionality, or hovering over variables to see their value.\n Until recently, this was only available for debugging mobile Flutter apps. In the last couple of months, we have been working on connecting expression evaluation to Flutter on the web and now have experimental support ready to try out in VSCode. Support for other IDEs, such as  IntelliJ, is still in progress.\n This feature is available on the Flutter dev or master channel. Use the following instructions to set it up for VS Code:\n Configure your project to  run on the web. Within VS Code, enable expression evaluation for web in  launch.json:\n  Set a breakpoint and start debugging. Try expression evaluation in the debug console using the expression evaluation box as shown below. Additionally, you can use the watch window or hover over variables to evaluate your code using expressions.\n     The latest builds of Flutter now support running automated Flutter driver UI tests against your Flutter web apps in just the same way that they work for mobile apps. To enable support for this experimental feature, you can  read the directions on the Flutter wiki.\n  Over the past few months, our focus has been spent on improving the infrastructure, quality and rendering for Flutter\u2019s web support. While we still have a lot to do, we have made significant progress in all three areas.\n  Building test infrastructure is one of those improvements that isn\u2019t always visible to those developing with Flutter but is nonetheless important to building a stable version of Flutter on the web.\n This past quarter we have added automated testing to ensure correctness of the web engine and framework. We added screenshot tests on Chrome to make sure we are rendering consistently and correctly as we make changes to the code. We now run unit and integration testing on Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Running these tests on mobile browsers and Internet Explorer/Edge will be coming online soon. Additionally, we have added performance benchmark tests, enabling us to iterate quickly  ...\n  Speaking of issues, we\u2019ve been busy burning down issues to incrementally improve our quality through optimizations and correctness fixes.\n Recently we landed an optimization in Flutter for web that improves scrolling for static content, meaning content that is not lazily loaded but is rendered all in the same frame. This should bring scrolling performance more in line with traditional web experiences.\n We\u2019ve also fixed several text rendering issues such as text disappearing behind the canvas or cursor problems with multiline text. These text correctness fixes are currently enabled behind the  FLUTTER_WEB_USE_EXPERIMENTAL_CANVAS_TEXT flag; our plan is to make this the platform default soon.\n At  Flutter Interact last year, we announced that our new Gallery sample app runs on the web using Flutter. Since then we\u2019ve made significant performance optimizations in web support as well as the app, so that it runs even faster and smoother. As a result of these changes, initial load time is now three times faster, and the code size has been reduced by 2.7x.\n  Stay tuned for an upcoming blog series that will share more about what we\u2019ve learned, as well as best practices for optimizing your Flutter app for performance. Until then, check out the updated  Flutter Gallery app for yourself.\n  When we started our exploration into the web, we considered a variety of approaches for rendering UI, knowing that our choice would dictate how well we could build, layout, and paint Flutter widgets on the web.\n We originally opted for an HTML DOM-based model that combines HTML, CSS, and the  Canvas API to express output produced by the Flutter framework. We call this implementation our DomCanvas rendering system.\n Over the last year, we have gained a better understanding of the performance and correctness characteristics of the various rendering technologies available on the web, and have been experimenting with a second approach that uses  CanvasKit. CanvasKit brings  Skia to the web using  WebAssembly and  WebGL, enabling a hardware-accelerated drawing surface that improves our ability to render complex and intensive graphics efficiently.\n We believe that both DomCanvas and CanvasKit offer advantages in different scenarios, and so we\u2019re supporting both rendering models.\n DomCanvas offers the greatest compatibility with a wide variety of browsers, with a compact code size. However, repaint performance is poorer, which makes it less suitable for more graphically-intensive applications.\n The CanvasKit backend offers superior performance, fidelity, and correctness, but it has poor initial startup time due to a larger code size.\n By default, Flutter\u2019s web support uses DomCanvas, but you can enable the CanvasKit rendering engine with this command:\n  One word of caution: the CanvasKit engine still has a few rough edges; for early adopters who are putting Flutter into production, the DomCanvas engine offers the greatest stability.\n  While we believe we\u2019re making good progress at building a solid foundation, there are a few other areas we are planning to work on to fill out our web support.\n Desktop-class UX. Supporting Flutter on desktop web browsers requires more than web support: there are typically significant UI differences between mobile and desktop experiences. We\u2019re therefore adding features to support desktop-class experiences, such as  responsive widgets and scrolling physics, that still need to be implemented.\n Autofill is a feature supported in most platforms, and in terms of the web, it means enabling the browser to store data and fill it in where appropriate. We  recently added initial autofill support to the core framework, and now we are working on  adding this feature to Flutter on the web. This effort includes addressing browser differences,  saving fill information for future autofills, and passing auto-fillable elements as a group to the engine.\n URL Routing. It\u2019s a small issue, perhaps, but today Flutter web apps include a  hash marker for routing even on the home page. We\u2019re working to eradicate this and provide more control over URL routing, with  contributions from the community under review at present.\n Code size remains an area of active investigation. Today every Flutter web app downloads the engine code that it needs; we\u2019re looking into possibilities to cache some of this logic to reduce startup time and download size.\n  We hope there are some fun surprises in this article: we\u2019ve made a lot of progress since the December update. However, you should be aware that Flutter\u2019s web support is still in beta, and you should be cautious about deploying it into production environments, since performance and browser compatibility work is still in progress.\n If you are new to developing with Flutter on the web, check out  flutter.dev/web to learn more and try out your code on  dartpad.dev or  codepen.io/flutter.\n For those that are currently developing Flutter web apps, thank you for your support and contributions, we hope you continue experimenting,  filing issues and  updating plugins to support the web!", "posttime":

"note_en": "(CNN)Norwegian multimillionaire  Tom Hagen has been arrested on suspicion of killing his wife, Anne-Elisabeth Hagen, who disappeared 18 months ago.\n Hagen&#39;s lawyer denies the property and energy mogul was involved, and he has not yet been charged with any crimes.\n Anne-Elisabeth Hagen, 69, disappeared in October 2018 and the family said a ransom had been demanded for her release, but on Tuesday Norwegian police arrested Hagen, 70, on suspicion of killing her, according to public broadcaster NRK.\n    The case was first reported in January 2019, attracting widespread attention in a nation where crime rates are low.\n Police say they now believe Anne-Elisabeth was killed and not abducted, and have enough evidence to &#34;suspect&#34; Tom of her killing.\n  &#34;It is important to emphasize that although we have charged Tom Hagen, the case is still being investigated and there are several unanswered questions,&#34; \u00d8st Police District said in a statement.\n &#34;It will be particularly important to clarify the role played by Tom Hagen, to find Anne-Elisabeth Hagen and to determine whether other people are involved.&#34;\n &#34;As the case initially appeared, our main theory was that Anne-Elisabeth Hagen had been abducted by someone with a financial motive. And in June 2019, we came to believe that she had most likely been killed,&#34; police said.\n  &#34;We now believe there was no abduction and there was never any genuine negotiations. In other words there was a clear and well-planned attempt at misleading the police,&#34; the statement added.\n The Norwegian legal system allows police to hold an individual on suspicion of a crime before formal charges are brought.\n  &#34;He strongly maintains that he has nothing to do with this,&#34; he told a group of reporters, according to Reuters.\n  Police asked the court to remand Hagen in custody for four weeks, with a ban on visits and outside communication, according to the statement.\n  They initially kept Anne-Elisabeth&#39;s disappearance a secret in a bid to protect her but then made the case public in January 2019.\n &#34;We can confirm that there is a ransom, and that serious threats have been issued,&#34; \u00d8ystein Stavdal Paulsen, senior adviser of Norway&#39;s East Police District, told CNN at the time.\n &#34;Regarding the ransom, we do not want to confirm what amount or in what form,&#34; he added.\n NRK reported at the time that multiple messages were found inside the Hagens&#39; home and that a ransom had been demanded in the cryptocurrency Monero.\n Hagen, a real estate investor and power facilities owner, is one of Norway&#39;s richest men, with a net worth of around $200 million, according to Norwegian financial magazine Kapital.\n   Anne-Elisabeth Hagen was a board member of her husband&#39;s holding company until September, according to NRK.\n The couple lived in Fjellhamar, a village about 12 miles northeast of Oslo, according to Norwegian public broadcaster NRK. The couple married in 1979 and have three adult children, it said.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:46:58", "tags": "\u59bb\u5b50,richest,\u8b66\u65b9,hagen", "title":

"note_en": "As California Gov. Gavin Newsom faces pushback for his expected order to close some beaches this weekend, the state saw a dramatic increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases, reaching the highest number of new cases recorded in a single day since the pandemic began.\n Throughout the state, there were 2,380 new coronavirus cases Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases in California to 48,770, according to data compiled by this news organization. The new cases Wednesday represent a 91% increase from the day before and a 3% increase from April 20, when the state had 2,312 news cases, previously the highest recorded number of new cases in a single day.\n Los Angeles County accounted for 63% of the new cases, reporting 1,509 on Wednesday, according to this news organization\u2019s data. That\u2019s also the highest number of new cases ever recorded in a single day in that county. The day before, Los Angeles had 559 new cases, and, like the rest of California, had been on a downward pace in recording new daily cases since April 20, when it recorded a then-high of 1475 new cases.\n Other Southern California counties saw big jumps in new cases Wednesday. They include Riverside, which, with 3,942 total COVID-19 cases, has the second highest number of cases in the state. Riverside reported 207 new cases, a 125% increase from the day before. The others were Orange and San Bernardino counties, which each had 101 new cases, increases of 83% and 304%, respectively.\n  The number of deaths in the state also continued to climb to a total of 1,943. There were only 78 new deaths reported Wednesday. That\u2019s a 33% drop from April 22, when the state reported 188 deaths, the highest number in a single day.\n The state Department of Public Health also reported that the number of COVID-19 tests reported statewide had reached 603,139 on Monday, a 4% increase from the day before.\n Prior to Wednesday, the number of new daily cases had begun to slow in California, offering an encouraging sign that the state was on track to meet one of Newsom\u2019s requirements for moving it out of its current stay-at-home ordering and allowing schools, business and workplaces to gradually reopen.\n The Bay Area, in contrast to Los Angeles and the rest of this state, continued to see the pace slow in the number of new cases Wednesday, according to this news organization\u2019s data. It reported 149 new cases, which brought its total number of cases to 8,101. The new cases Wednesday represent a 9% drop from the day before.\n The number of new COVID-19-related deaths reported daily also continued to slow in the Bay Area. There were seven deaths on Wednesday, bringing the region\u2019s total to 283. But Wednesday\u2019s reported deaths represents a 66% decrease from the 21 deaths recorded on April 22.\n  In fact, Santa Clara County, once the region\u2019s epicenter of its COVID-19 crisis, recorded its lowest number of new cases in a single day \u2014 just 12 \u2014 since the pandemic began.\n On Wednesday, public health officials in six Bay Area County counties announced that shelter in place would continue through May 31. But the officials \u2014 in\u00a0Santa Clara, San Mateo, San Francisco, Alameda and Contra Costa counties \u2014 also began the process of moving the region towards normalization by loosening restrictions on some outdoor activities and businesses such as construction and golf, as well as some forms of childcare.\n On Tuesday,\u00a0Newsom talked about how schools could possibly reopen in July, as his office laid out a four-stage plan for letting lower-risk businesses and workplaces resume operations in the next few weeks \u2014 as long as\u00a0social distancing continued to push down the number of new cases.\n  But Newsom  expressed dismay at images of people thronging to beaches in Southern California last weekend despite the social distancing order. Some 80,000 people flocked to Newport Beach in Orange County, south\u00a0of Los Angeles, with additional thousands gathering at open beaches in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles, the Associated Press reported.\n On Wednesday, Newsom sent a memo to police chiefs around the state, ordering them to close all beaches up and down the California coastline, Eric Nu\u00f1ez, president of the California Police Chiefs Association, told the Associated Press. But on Thursday he said the order would only apply to beaches in Orange County.\n Most Bay Area counties have already closed beaches, with the exception of Santa Cruz County, which had allowed people wide use of beaches for exercise and as long they followed recommended social distancing practices.\n But Santa Cruz County officials revisited their regulations this week after people, including visitors from out of the county, crowded its coastal spots and created traffic hazards along Highway 1. On Wednesday, officials announced they would be closed from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. except for water-based activities such as surfing or swimming, and otherwise only open for activities like walking or running.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:46:53", "tags": "\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71,\u6e7e\u533a,\u8dc3\u5347,los,\u6d77\u6ee9", "title": "\u52a0\u5dde\uff0c\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u65b0\u75c5\u4f8b\u8dc3\u5347\uff0c\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u6e7e\u533a\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d", "title_en": "California, Los Angeles see jump in new cases, Bay Area continues down", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/04/30/coronavirus-california-los-angeles-see-huge-jump-in-new-cases/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71", "\u6e7e\u533a", "\u8dc3\u5347", "los", "\u6d77\u6ee9"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "812d36ec4d4d4270b90167fbf5d22793.jpg", "infoid": 1000052, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "1230\u4e07\u50cf\u7d20\u7d22\u5c3cIMX477\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u30017.9 mm\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u56fe\u50cf\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u80cc\u5149\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80cc\u7126\u53ef\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301C\u548cCS\u5b89\u88c5\u955c\u5934\u3002\n\u73b0\u5728\u5c31\u4e70\u3002\n\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7CS\u5b89\u88c5\u955c\u5934\u548c\u9644\u5e26\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684C\u5b89\u88c5\u955c\u5934\u3002CGL 6 mm CS\u5b89\u88c5\u955c\u5934\u548c16 mm C\u5b89\u88c5\u955c\u5934\u662f\u4e0e\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u76f8\u673a\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff1b\u8bf7\u53c2\u9605\u5b89\u88c5\u8fd9\u4e9bCS\u5b89\u88c5\u955c\u5934\u548cC\u5b89\u88c5\u955c\u5934\u7684\u5206\u6b65\u8bf4\u660e\u3002\n\u6709\u5173\u5982\u4f55\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u80cc\u7126\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u4e09\u811a\u67b6\u5b89\u88c5\u3001\u5c06\u76f8\u673a\u8fde\u63a5\u5230Raspberry PI\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728Raspbian\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u76f8\u673a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bf7\u53c2\u9605\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5165\u95e8\u6307\u5357\u3002\nSONY IMX477R\u5806\u53e0\u5f0f\u80cc\u5149\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c1230\u4e07\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c7.9mm\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\uff0c1.55\u03bcm\u00d71.55\u03bcm\u50cf\u7d20\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4f7f\u547d\u662f\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5236\u9020\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u4ea4\u5230\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u4eba\u4eec\u624b\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8ba9\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6280\u672f\u7684\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4ed6\u4eec\u5173\u5fc3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u9020\u6027\u5730\u8868\u8fbe\u81ea\u5df1\u3002", "note_en": "12.3 megapixel Sony IMX477 sensor, 7.9mm diagonal image size, and back-illuminated sensor architecture, with adjustable back focus and support for C- and CS-mount lenses\n Buy now\n  The High Quality Camera is designed to accept CS-mount lenses and, with the supplied adapter, C-mount lenses.

Kelleher-Hazlett of", "note_en": "For years, Cheryl Dopp considered the ding on her phone from a new Airbnb Inc. booking to be the sound of what she called \u201cmagical money.\u201d A property she rented out in Jersey City, N.J., on Airbnb could gross more than $8,000 a month, she said, double what long-term tenants would pay.\n Now, Ms. Dopp associates the dings with cancellations and financial misery. The 54-year-old information-technology contractor said she had about $10,000 in bookings evaporate overnight in March. She has $22,000 in monthly expenses for a largely Airbnb portfolio, she said, that included another Jersey City home and a house in Miami.\n In her mind, the promise of more rental income offset the growing debt, she said. \u201cI made a bargain with the devil.\u201d\n  Ms. Dopp is part of an upper-crust dimension of the gig economy: property owners and speculators who bought or leased real estate in pursuit of Airbnb profits. Airbnb spawned a cottage industry of homeowners running their own property empires, turning the startup into a hotelier without any hotels.\n The coronavirus\u2019s spread has exposed swaths of the U.S. economy that were ill-suited for a crisis\u2014great for offering inexpensive goods and services quickly, terrible in an economic disaster.\n  The sharing economy has proven particularly unstable in the pandemic. Silicon Valley championed the concept of turning America into a land of entrepreneurs taking advantage of flexible hours, unimpeded by regulations or specialized training. People who bought into the idea turned their cars into work stations for Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. or became couriers for food-delivery services like DoorDash.\n     They have taken a hit, but with Airbnb, the problems are broader. Hosts brought with them cleaning services, interior designers and property-maintenance workers who helped build miniature property empires\u2014so their plight has ripple effects that go far beyond their own listings.\n Airbnb hosts saw $1.5 billion in bookings vanish in mid-March as the travel industry froze, according to market-research firm AirDNA LLC, which analyzes bookings. Airbnb gave guests full refunds and forced hosts to dip into their pockets or beg for leniency on April loans and rent.\n \u201cHosts should\u2019ve always been prepared for this income to go away,\u201d said Gina Marotta, a principal at Argentia Group Inc., which does credit-risk analysis for real-estate loans. \u201cInstead, they built an expensive lifestyle feeding off of it.\u201d\n The startup that gave rise to the short-term rental economy is slashing expenses and secured $2 billion in financing this month, including a $1 billion loan at a hefty interest rate. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Airbnb had racked up hundreds of millions in losses due to the pandemic. The company hasn\u2019t publicly reported figures.\n Though most real-estate economists say there are too few Airbnb properties to ignite a housing crisis, the breakdown of the Airbnb economy could strain lenders, undermine property values and validate some local governments\u2019 long-held suspicions that Airbnb contributed to the affordable-housing crisis.\n \u201cNo one anticipated that a global pandemic would require the country to shelter in place, upend the economy,\u201d said Airbnb spokesman Nick Papas. \u201cThis is temporary: Travel will bounce back and Airbnb hosts\u2014the vast majority of whom have just one listing\u2014will continue to welcome guests and generate income.\u201d\n Mr. Papas said the company accounts for a fraction of the global housing stock and would have minimal effect on the broader market. Airbnb has more than 3 million hosts and more than 7 million listings globally, he said.\n Airbnb hosts\u2019 backgrounds, financial circumstances and businesses vary, which makes addressing their woes challenging. They operate in a gray market in many cities because short-term rental laws are still evolving. Their models range from owning property to signing long-term rental agreements for apartments.\n AirDNA estimates that a third of Airbnb\u2019s U.S. listings for entire homes or apartments\u2014excluding shared rooms\u2014are by hosts with a single property. Another third are run by hosts with between two and 24 properties. The remaining third involve hosts with more than 25 properties.\n Some of those hosts renting 25-plus properties are managed by startups such as Sonder Corp. and Lyric Hospitality Inc., which pay to rent hundreds of apartments they sublease on Airbnb and elsewhere. Many of those companies have furloughed or laid off staff in recent weeks.\n Airbnb\u2019s Mr. Papas said the company doesn\u2019t break down data by properties and can\u2019t comment on the accuracy of AirDNA\u2019s data. He said more than 70% of hosts world-wide have only one listing, and those listings account for about half of Airbnb\u2019s listings. He declined to break down the percentage of hosts listing entire homes versus those subletting rooms.\n Smaller players have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars each buying homes for short-term rentals. Jennifer Kelleher-Hazlett of Clawson, Mich., spent about $380,000 to buy two Michigan properties in 2018. She said she and her husband cashed out their financial investments and borrowed $100,000 from employers to furnish them.\n The 47-year-old expected to net up to $7,000 a month from Airbnb after mortgage payments, supplementing her income as a part-time pharmacist and her husband\u2019s as a schoolteacher. Before the virus struck, the couple was considering buying more homes. Now, they can\u2019t make mortgage payments because no one is booking, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re either borrowing more or defaulting.\u201d\n Airbnb let hosts set their own refund policies over canceled stays. Hosts with strict policies would receive half the money on canceled stays. Many factored a steady stream of income when planning for the future.\n Airbnb\u2019s Mr. Papas said the majority of active listings didn\u2019t have strict cancellation policies.\n Hosts\u2019 sense of control disappeared as the crisis took hold and the company stepped in to ameliorate travelers\u2019 panicked cancellations. Airbnb granted guests full refunds for stays between March 14 and May 31, wrenching the finances of those who had used Airbnb income to underwrite and sustain their mini-empires.\n Airbnb has said while it gave hosts the flexibility to set their own cancellation policies, hosts agreed to an \u201cextenuating circumstances policy\u201d that allowed the company to override them\u2014as it did when the pandemic hit.\n Some hosts feel Airbnb hung them out to dry. \u201cI don\u2019t think that hosts ever thought their policies would be overridden,\u201d said Ms. Kelleher-Hazlett. \u201cThey\u2019re very guest-centric.\u201d\n Later, Airbnb said it would pay hosts 25% of what they would have received for canceled bookings and created a $17 million fund to help top-rated hosts cover mortgages. Airbnb said it would cap grants at $5,000 per host.\n That sum would provide little relief to hosts such as Jennifer and David Landrum of Atlanta. In 2016, they started a company named Local, spending more than $14,000 to outfit apartments with rugs, throw pillows, art and chandeliers. They grossed about $1.5 million annually, mostly through Airbnb, Ms. Landrum said, renting the 18 apartments they leased and 21 apartments they managed to corporate travelers and film-industry workers.\n They spend about $50,000 annually with cleaning services, about $25,000 on an inspector and $30,000 a year on maintenance staff and landscapers, Ms. Landrum said, not to mention spending on furnishings.\n When Airbnb began refunding guests March 14, the Landrums had nearly $40,000 in cancellations, she said. The couple has been able to pay only a portion of April rent on the 18 apartments they lease and can\u2019t fulfill their obligations to pay three months\u2019 rent unless bookings resume. They have reduced pay to cleaning staff and others. Adding to the stress, Georgia banned short-term rentals through April.\n \u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d said Ms. Landrum, who said she has discounted some units three times since mid-March. The Landrums have negotiated to get some leniency from apartment owners on their leases. If not, Ms. Landrum said, they would have to sell their house.\n Florida, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Delaware also have clamped down on short-term rentals, instituting temporary bans on Airbnb properties and similar listings. Local governments including California\u2019s Sonoma County and Myrtle Beach, S.C., have enacted similar restrictions. The measures have made it harder for some Airbnb hosts to fill properties with families looking to quarantine outside their homes or near relatives.\n Nearly one in five hosts that Airbnb recently surveyed said hosting on the platform helped them avoid eviction or foreclosure. The company presented these findings to U.S. Congressional leaders and successfully lobbied to have hosts covered under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\u2014known as the Cares Act\u2014making them potentially eligible for small-business loans and unemployment assistance, among other things.\n That program\u2019s funds ran out but were replenished with Congress\u2019 approval this month of another $484 billion in aid. It wasn\u2019t clear how many hosts would qualify or whether disbursements would be fast enough to cover their losses.\n In March, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said owners of investment properties with loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could seek forbearance if they couldn \u2019t pay their mortgages due to loss of income related to the coronavirus \u2014a change that could help some Airbnb hosts. The agency later moved to help mortgage companies facing a cash-flow crunch, capping at four months the period the companies are on the hook to make monthly payments on behalf  ...\n The pandemic\u2019s financial hit could cause lenders to re-evaluate their exposure to Airbnb, said Susan Wachter, a real-estate professor at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of business. \u201cThere\u2019s no rescue in place for this.\u201d\n Many Airbnb hosts are desperate to sell properties, say real-estate brokers like Greg Hague, who runs a Phoenix real-estate firm and helped state lawmakers draft short-term-rental legislation. \u201cThere\u2019s been a flood of people. You have people coming to us saying, \u2018I\u2019m a month or two away from foreclosure. What\u2019s it going to take to get it sold now?\u2019 \u201d he said. That has diminished overall property values, he said.\n Airbnb\u2019s Mr. Papas said there was no statistical evidence suggesting home sales or prices had been affected.\n As short-term-listings bans were passed around the country, Airbnb said it was shifting to focus on long-term stays and encouraged hosts to allow them. Some hosts under pressure to generate income have pursued traditional 12-month leases on Zillow, Craigslist and other sites.\n In Nashville, Tenn., which grants permits to hosts, about a dozen of the city\u2019s 3,600 nonowner-occupied listings\u2014which include Airbnb properties\u2014surfaced in the first days of April as advertisements for one-year leases on Zillow or Craigslist, according to Host Compliance LLC, a software provider tracking permits for the city. City leaders said they feared more would follow.\n One of the apartments is in City View, a development with a swimming pool and rooftop views of downtown. When City View was completed in 2015, councilman Freddie O\u2019Connell, who represents the district and has worked to rein in short-term rentals, hoped it would lure young professionals and families and help ease the city\u2019s housing shortage. Instead, he said, it became a haven for short-term rentals.\n \u201cWith Airbnb, magical thinking got out there,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Connell. \u201cPeople have taken on a lot of risk, and we\u2019re seeing the consequences of that now.\u201d City View declined to comment.\n Ms. Dopp, the IT contractor, bought two Jersey City properties in 2015 each with multiple apartments. She listed one apartment for $140 a night and generated $4,200 from it that month, she said. She also bought a Miami house that she listed on Airbnb and other short-term rental sites under a pseudonym and used the anticipated revenue from the properties to support a six-figure loan for maintenance, she said.\n When states began locking down, Ms. Dopp said, \u201cI thought, \u2018Holy God. We\u2019re about to lose everything.\u2019 \u201d\n Though some of her properties had long-term tenants, she lost most Airbnb bookings through spring, she said, and can\u2019t cover April\u2019s mortgages, property taxes and insurance. A family rented her Miami home at a discounted rate on Airbnb, she said, providing some relief.

analysis from a randomized, controlled trial involving 1063 patients, which began on February 21. The trial (known as the  Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial, or ACTT), sponsored by the  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, is the first clinical  ...\n An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) overseeing the trial met on April 27 to review data and shared their interim analysis with the study team. Based upon their review of the data, they noted that remdesivir was better than placebo from the perspective of the primary endpoint, time to recovery, a metric often used in influenza trials. Recovery in this study was defined as being well enough for hospital discharge or returning to normal activity level.\n Preliminary results indicate that patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (p&lt;0.001). Specifically, the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo. Results also suggested a survival benefit, with a mortality rate of 8.0% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group (p=0.059).\n More detailed information about the trial results, including more comprehensive data, will be available in a forthcoming report. As part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2019s commitment to expediting the development and availability of potential COVID-19 treatments, the agency has been engaged in sustained and ongoing discussions with Gilead Sciences regarding making remdesivir available to patients as quickly as possible, as appropriate. The trial closed to new enrollments on April  ...\n The first trial participant in the ACTT trial was an American who was repatriated after being quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Yokohama, Japan, and volunteered to participate in the study at the first study site, the University of Nebraska Medical Center/Nebraska Medicine, in February 2020. A total of 68 sites ultimately joined the study\u201447 in the United States and 21 in countries in Europe and Asia.\n Remdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences Inc., is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment administered via daily infusion for 10 days. It  has shown promise in animal models for treating SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection and has been examined in various clinical trials.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:46:32", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c,clinical,\u6cbb\u7597", "title": "NIH\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u663e\u793aRemdevir\u52a0\u901f\u665a\u671f\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u6062\u590d", "title_en": "NIH Clinical Trial Shows Remdesivir Accelerates Recovery from Advanced Covid-19", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-shows-remdesivir-accelerates-recovery-advanced-covid-19", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c", "clinical", "\u6cbb\u7597"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f6555c3f1b449f625c2934b0596913f1.jpg", "infoid": 1000049, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5496\u5561\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u76ca\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u996e\u6599\u3002\u5982\u679c\u7528\u6ee4\u7eb8\u5668\u917f\u9020\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u4f60\u66f4\u597d\u3002\n\u632a\u5a01\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u6536\u96c6\u4e86508\uff0c747\u540d\u5e74\u9f84\u572820\u5c81\u81f379\u5c81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7537\u6027\u548c\u5973\u6027\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e73\u574720\u5e74\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8c03\u67e5\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fd8\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u559d\u7684\u5496\u5561\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6570\u91cf-\u7528\u7eb8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6216\u7528\u672a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5(\u5982\u6cd5\u5f0f\u538b\u69a8\u6216\u6d53\u7f29\u5496\u5561)\u51b2\u6ce1\u3002\n\u5728\u7537\u6027\u548c\u5973\u6027\u4e2d\uff0c\u996e\u7528\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5496\u5561\u4e0e\u56e0\u4efb\u4f55\u539f\u56e0\u8fc7\u65e9\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u964d\u4f4e15%\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u4f46\u672a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5496\u5561\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1a\u559d\u672a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5496\u5561\u7684\u7537\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u4e864%\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u4e869%\u3002\n\u4e0e\u672a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5496\u5561\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5496\u5561\u6b7b\u4e8e\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u3001\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u6216\u4e2d\u98ce\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u6bcf\u5929\u559d\u4e00\u5230\u56db\u676f\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u8868\u5728\u201c\u6b27\u6d32\u9884\u9632\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u5b66\u6742\u5fd7\u201d\u4e0a\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u5176\u4ed6\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n\u4e0e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5496\u5561\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5496\u5561\u542b\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u4e8c\u841c\u7c7b\u63d0\u9ad8\u80c6\u56fa\u9187\u7684\u690d\u7269\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8d28\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u81f3\u5c11\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u8005\u3001\u632a\u5a01\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u90e8\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7814\u7a76\u5458Aage Tverdal\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u953b\u70bc\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u4f53\u91cd\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5f88\u663e\u8457\u3002\n\u201c\u4e0d\u7ba1\u4f60\u559d\u4ec0\u4e48\u5496\u5561\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u201c\u4eab\u53d7\u4f60\u7684\u5496\u5561\u3002\u5982\u679c\u65b9\u4fbf\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u559d\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5496\u5561\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u80c6\u56fa\u9187\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u8bdd\u3002\u201c", "note_en": "Coffee can be a healthful drink. It may be even better for you when brewed with a paper filter.\n Norwegian researchers gathered health data on 508,747 men and women 20 to 79 years old and followed them for an average of 20 years. The participants also reported the type and quantity of coffee they drank \u2014 filtered through paper or brewed using unfiltered methods like French press or espresso.\n Drinking filtered coffee was associated with a 15 percent reduction in the risk of dying prematurely from any cause in both men and women. But rates were lower when the coffee was unfiltered: Men who drank unfiltered coffee had a 4 percent reduction, and women a 9 percent reduction.\n Compared with unfiltered coffee, filtered coffee was associated with a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease or stroke. The lowest mortality was among those who drank one to four cups a day. The  study, in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, controlled for many other cardiovascular risk factors.\n Unfiltered coffee contains much higher concentrations of cholesterol-raising phytochemicals called diterpenes than does filtered coffee, which may explain at least part of the effect.\n The lead author, Aage Tverdal, a senior researcher with the Norwegian Department of Public Health, said that the effect on cardiovascular health is modest compared with that of exercise or weight control, but still significant.\n \u201cWhatever kind of coffee you drink,\u201d he said, \u201cenjoy your coffee. If it\u2019s convenient, drink filtered coffee, especially if you have high cholesterol.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:46:27", "tags": "\u5496\u5561,coffee", "title": "\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5496\u5561\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u5fc3\u810f\u5065\u5eb7\u7279\u522b\u6709\u597d\u5904", "title_en": "Filtered coffee may be especially good for heart health", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/well/eat/filtered-coffee-heart-health-benefits.html", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u5496\u5561", "coffee"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c6006fedb49feae7d1b231e508d248b6.jpg", "infoid": 1000048, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u5173\u95ed\u65b0\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65c5\u884c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u643a\u5e26\u53e3\u7f69\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u965b\u4e0b\uff1f\n\u513f\u7ae5\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u514d\u75ab\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u662f\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u3002\u5b69\u5b50\u548c\u7956\u7236\u6bcd\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709\u5bc6\u5207\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u805a\u4f1a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6700\u5371\u9669\u7684\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u65b0\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ed9\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff01\uff01BC\u8fd9\u4e0d\u50cf\u4f60\u3002\u4e00\u70b9\u4e5f\u4e0d\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u5ff5\u5173\u5fc3\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u7684\u4f0a\u9686\uff0c\u91d1\u8272\u4f0a\u9686\u7684\u5fc3\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u547c\u5438\u673a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u751f\u4ea7\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u77ed\u7f3a\u3002\n\u6055\u6211\u76f4\u8a00\uff0c\u65b0\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u80e1\u8bf4\u516b\u9053\u3002\u548c\u75c5\u6bd2\u5b66\u5bb6\u3001\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u5bb6\u3001\u4efb\u4f55\u77e5\u9053\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u8c08\u8bba\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u4eba\u8c08\u8c08\u3002\u6211\u7684\u5bb6\u4eba\u5728\u610f\u5927\u5229\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u90fd\u5904\u4e8e\u5c01\u9501\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u4eba\u5728\u6b7b\u53bb\u3002\u706b\u846c\u573a\u8ddf\u4e0d\u4e0a\u4e86\u3002427\u4eba\u5c31\u5728\u4eca\u5929\u53bb\u4e16\u4e86\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u8ba9\u4eba\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u8fd9\u4f1a\u57284\u6708\u5e95\u524d\u70df\u6d88\u4e91\u6563\uff0c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4eba\u6570\u4f1a\u6bd4\u73b0\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u95ee\u95ee\u4f60\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u5426\u60f3\u8981\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u3002\u4f19\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u8f66\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u706b\u7bad\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u4f46\u4f60\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u5f97\u4e0d\u591f\u6df1\u5165\u3002\u8bf7\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u3002", "note_en": "\u65b0\u5bf9\u8bdd  With or without closures, social distancing, widespread testing, travel restrictions, and people carrying masks, my liege?\n  Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable.

"note_en": "JPMorgan economists cut their second-quarter forecast even more, now expecting the economy will decline by 40%.\n The economists said the 16.8 million jobless claims filed in the last three weeks indicate a huge surge in job losses, which they estimate at 25 million in April.\n A number of Wall Street firms expect contractions in the second quarter of 30% or more.\n JPMorgan economists issued an even more dire forecast, now foreseeing a 40% decline in the nation&#39;s gross domestic product for the second quarter and a surge in April&#39;s unemployment rate to 20% with 25 million jobs lost.\n   The economists, however, continue to see a second-half recovery, based on the assumption that disruptions from the pandemic fade by June.\u00a0They note that the number of people seeking unemployment benefits has totaled 16.8 million in just three weeks.\n  &#34;With these data in hand we think the April jobs report could indicate about 25 million jobs lost since the March survey week, and an unemployment rate around 20%,&#34; they wrote, &#34;Given the expected hit to hours worked this quarter we now look for -40.0% annualized real GDP growth in 2Q, down from -25.0% previously.&#34;\n They expect the third quarter to rebound with growth of 23%, and a fourth-quarter increase of 13%. They forecast a 10% decline in the first quarter. The economists said they will finalize their employment forecast for April in coming weeks.\n In general, economists have had a difficult time measuring the impact of the virus shutdowns and many have been revising their forecasts, with a number of firms now seeing hits of more than 30% in the second quarter, historical levels that have no modern precedent.\n &#34;Over the last few weeks forecasters have been operating in a fog. Economic models that have been trained on post-war data face obvious limitations. In their place we have reverted to differing ways to address the outlook,&#34; they wrote.\n  The JPMorgan economists said they initially considered the impact on demand, looking at the type of spending cuts that would come as social distancing was expanded and increased in duration. They said they later looked at the supply side impact, as stay-at-home orders increased and limited the quality and effectiveness of labor as a factor of production.\n  &#34;The long-run destruction of the level of output is difficult to quantify, but likely quite large,&#34; they wrote.\n The economists issued the latest forecast after Thursday&#39;s jobless claims showed another jump of 6.6 million workers filing for jobless claims and a sharp decline in hours worked.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:46:09", "tags": "\u6469\u6839,economy,\u9884\u8ba1,quarter", "title":

"note_en": "Before showcasing other people\u2019s boneheaded decisions, I will lead the way with my own. From here, there will be stories of others\u2019 mistakes. Including how they used them to springboard into success.\n If you are interested in sharing your own big mistake, please contact me via  https://toddmoses.com/about/contact. Otherwise, let\u2019s get started.\n  While picking up my youngest from preschool, I was told that tomorrow is \u201cDoughnuts with Dad\u201d day. An event where fathers visit their children at school for breakfast. The teacher explained it with such joy, and asked, \u201cwill you be able to attend?\u201d With a slight pause, I proclaimed, \u201cif I can.\u201d Her face saddened.\n During this time, I was Lead Engineer for a hedge fund. A position that made me believe my importance to the company was greater than it actually was. Working weekends, going to employer-sponsored events, and just being absent from home was the norm. However, we had zero financial concerns.\n Asking for time off for anything, especially children, was a fast way to be shown the door. Wanting to be promoted, I decided to skip the \u201cDoughnuts with Dad\u201d and arrive at the office early. \u201cI have to work and will not be there today,\u201d I told my little boy while walking him to his classroom. \u201cOk,\u201d he said in the middle of a slight hug.\n   It turned out that I was the only father out of twenty that did not attend. Even writing these words fill me with regret. So what did I get for hurting my child? Not a promotion. Instead, they laid off my entire department a year later.\n That was the result. The lesson was my philosophy of \u201cbusiness must serve people, not people serving business.\u201d Meaning that the reason we go to work, build companies, and invest must be to serve our families. If going to work, regardless of who founded the place, requires you to hurt your loved ones, then it is not a viable business.\n In the past few years, this concept has been expanded to include, \u201cfinancial protection over business continuation.\u201d An idea that is the basis of  Todd Insights. Basically it is the premise that the earning potential of a business is worth more than the company itself \u2014 giving business owners permission to create a Plan B. You can read more about these concepts on  https://toddmoses.com.\n  It was the first time I let my son down \u2014 planting a seed that dad only cares about himself. Even six years later my child still remembers it. Painful stuff.\n  I would have attended \u201cDoughnuts with Dad\u201d. No question. The thought of being able to redo this moment gave rise to the Rewind Series.\n  Never put work before your family. Sure, everyone has to pay the bills. However, never take the position of being a better employee over being the best parent and spouse you can.\n   Wow. This got a little more personal than I am used to. Not sure how future episodes will be.

Classes are offered by Mid-Michigan Community College at Huron Area Tech Center in Bad Axe despite the college being 120 miles away. It&#39;s a move by the college to help get higher education in areas without access to higher education. \u00a0 (Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press)\n Essential workers in Michigan would be eligible for free college under a new plan being proposed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n The plan, modeled on the GI Bill, would pay for college for those front-line workers who don&#39;t have a college degree, Whitmer said in announcing it Wednesday. Those eligible would be workers\u00a0&#34;like the ones staffing our hospitals and nursing homes, stocking the shelves at grocery stores, providing child care to critical infrastructure workers, manufacturing PPE, protecting public safety, picking up trash\u00a0or delivering supplies,&#34; the state said in the announcement.\n The plan is being called Futures for Frontliners. It is being billed as the first-such program in the nation.\n Details about the program, how people would apply for it or\u00a0how much it would cost\u00a0were not immediately released. Whitmer said the state would use federal grant money to pay the costs.\n \u201cThe Futures for Frontliners program is our way of saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to those who have risked their lives on the front lines of this crisis,&#34; Whitmer said in a statement. &#34;This program will ensure tuition-free college opportunities and give these dedicated Michiganders an opportunity to earn a technical certificate, associate degree or even a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n  \u201cI want to assure all of our workers we will never forget those of you who stepped up and sacrificed their own health during this crisis. You\u2019re the reason we\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d\n In referencing the GI Bill, Whitmer said Americans have a history of rewarding those who put their lives on the line to fight an enemy.\n    Whitmer added she is looking forward to the bipartisan legislative coalition that pushed through a program called Reconnect, which offers tuition-free access to community college for adults over the age of 25 without a college degree.\n Whitmer has been working to increase the\u00a0percentage of Michigan adults who have some sort of post-high school credential or degree,\u00a0 from 45% to 60%, by 2030.\n   &#34;This new initiative will reward those who continue to work on behalf of their neighbors, giving of themselves,&#34; Ryan Fewins-Bliss told the Free Press. &#34;This is a great start to rewarding front-line workers by investing in their education. Hopefully this opens doors for them to increase their income, continue their career in new ways and fulfill their dreams of a better life.\n &#34;This focus on education is incredibly necessary as we look to rebuild our communities and our economy. I hope it represents just the beginning of our government\u2019s investment in education once the crisis is over.&#34;\n Marissa Cramer of Warren is one of the workers who would be eligible for the free college under the plan. The 22-year-old\u00a0\u00a0works at a grocery store for just above minimum wage.\n &#34;I really want to go to school and do something in nursing or something like that, but I make just enough money to pay for my son and I to live,&#34; she said. &#34;I can&#39;t really get the money together to go to school and I don&#39;t want to go into debt. I hope this really happens. I&#39;d sign up as soon as I can.&#34;\n The state&#39;s higher education associations also said they wanted to work with Whitmer to make a program happen.\n &#34;We don\u2019t know a lot of the details of the proposal but we are always supportive of ideas that improve access to higher education and remove barriers for people trying to reach their education and career goals,&#34; Michael Hansen of the\u00a0Michigan Community College Association told the Free Press. &#34;We certainly look forward to working with the legislature to develop a program that can help achieve these objectives for our frontline workers.&#34;\n  &#34;Any state-supported program, like the Futures for Frontliners initiative announced today by Governor Whitmer, is a good investment in Michigan, its communities and its people, especially those who have been at the leading edge of helping us confront this pandemic,&#34; he said. &#34;The state universities of Michigan look forward to working with Gov. Whitmer, state lawmakers and our partners in postsecondary education to see that this program is realized and that its intent of  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:46:01", "tags":

"note_en": "Before anybody even had a computer, Claude Shannon figured out how to make computers worth having.\n As an electrical engineering graduate student at MIT, Shannon played around with a \u201cdifferential analyzer,\u201d a crude forerunner to computers. But for his  master\u2019s thesis, he was more concerned with relays and switches in electrical circuits, the sorts of things found in telephone exchange networks. In 1937 he produced, in the words of mathematician  Solomon Golomb, \u201cone of the greatest master \u2019s theses ever, \u201destablishing the connection between symbolic logic and the math for describing such  ...\n It\u2019s now conveniently a good time to celebrate  Shannon\u2019s achievements, on the occasion of the centennial of his birth (April 30) in Petoskey, Michigan, in 1916. Based on the pervasive importance of computing in society today, it wouldn\u2019t be crazy to call the time since then \u201cShannon\u2019s Century.\u201d\n \u201cIt is no exaggeration,\u201d  wrote Golomb, \u201cto refer to Claude Shannon as the \u2018father of the information age,\u2019 and his intellectual achievement as one of the greatest of the twentieth century.\u201d\n  Shannon is most well-known for creating an entirely new scientific field \u2014 information theory \u2014 in a  pair of paperspublished in 1948. His foundation for that work, though, was built a decade earlier, in his thesis. There he devised equations that represented the behavior of electrical circuitry. How a circuit behaves depends on the interactions of relays and switches that can connect (or not) one terminal to another. Shannon sought a \u201ccalculus \u201dfor mathematically representing a circuit  ...\n \u201cAny circuit is represented by a set of equations, the terms of the equations corresponding to the various relays and switches in the circuit,\u201d Shannon wrote. His calculus for manipulating those equations, he showed, \u201cis exactly analogous to the calculus of propositions used in the symbolic study of logic.\u201d\n As an undergraduate math (and electrical engineering) major at the University of Michigan, Shannon had learned of 19th century mathematician  George Boole\u2019s workon representing logical statements by algebraic symbols. Boole devised a way to calculate logical conclusions about propositions using binary numbers; 1 represented a true proposition and 0 a false proposition. Shannon perceived an analogy between Boole \u2019s logical propositions and the flow of current in electrical circuits. If  ...\n For his Ph.D. dissertation, Shannon analyzed the mathematics of genetics in populations, but that work wasn \u2019t published. In 1941 he began working at Bell Labs; during World War II, he wrote an important (at the time secret) paper on cryptography, which required deeper consideration of how to quantify information. After the war he developed those ideas more fully, focusing on using his 1s and 0s, or bits, to show how much information could be sent through a communications channel and  ...\n In 1948, his two papers on those issues appeared in the  Bell System Technical Journal. They soon were published, with an introductory chapter by  Warren Weaver, in a book titled   The Mathematical Theory of Communication. Today that book is regarded as the founding document of information theory.\n For Shannon, communication was not about the message, or its meaning, but about how much information could be communicated in a message (through a given channel). At its most basic, communication is simply the reproduction of a message at some point remote from its point of origin. Such a message might have a \u201cmeaning, \u201dbut such meaning \u201cis irrelevant to the engineering problem \u201dof transferring the message from one point to another, Shannon asserted. \u201cThe significant aspect is that  ...\n In a very simple communication system, if the only possible messages are \u201cyes \u201dand \u201cno, \u201dthen each message (1 for yes, 0 for no) reduces your ignorance by half. By Shannon \u2019s math, that corresponds to one bit of information. (He didn \u2019t coin the term \u201cbit \u201d\u2014short for binary digit \u2014but his work established its meaning.) Now consider a more complicated situation \u2014an unabridged English dictionary, which should contain roughly half a million words. One bit would correspond to a yes-or-no  ...\n Shannon investigated much more complicated situations and devised theorems for calculating information quantity and how to communicate it efficiently in the presence of noise. His math remains central to almost all of modern digital technology. As electrical engineer  Andrew Viterbi\u00a0wrote in a Shannon eulogy, Shannon\u2019s 1948 papers \u201cestablished all the key parameters and limits for optimal compression and transmission of digital information.\u201d\n Beyond its practical uses, Shannon \u2019s work later proved to have profound scientific significance. His math quantifying information in bits borrowed the equations expressing the second law of thermodynamics, in which the concept of entropy describes the probability of a system \u2019s state. Probability applied to the ways in which a system \u2019s parts could be arranged, it seemed, mirrored the probabilities involved in reducing ignorance about a possible message. Shannon, well aware of  ...\n Shannon apparently wasn\u2019t sure. He told one writer in 1979 that he thought the connection between his entropy and thermodynamics would \u201chold up in the long run\u201d but hadn\u2019t been sufficiently explored . But nowadays a deep conceptual link shows up not only between Shannon\u2019s information theory and thermodynamics, but in fields as diverse as quantum mechanics, molecular biology and the physics of black holes.\n Shannon\u2019s understanding of information plays a central role, for instance, in explaining how the notorious Maxwell\u2019s demon can\u2019t violate thermodynamics\u2019 second law. Much of that work is based on  Landauer\u2019s principle, the requirement that energy is expended when information is erased. In developing that principle,  Rolf Landauer\u00a0(an IBM physicist) was himself influenced both by Shannon\u2019s work and the work of Sadi Carnot in discerning the second law in the early 19th century.\n Something Shannon and Carnot had in common, Landauer once emphasized to me, was that both discovered mathematical restrictions on physical systems that were independent of the details of the system. In other words, Carnot \u2019s limit on the efficiency of steam engines applied to any sort of engine, no matter what it was made of or how it was designed. Shannon \u2019s principles specifying the limits on information compression and transmission apply no matter what technology is used to  ...\n \u201cThey both find limits for what you can do which are independent of future inventions,\u201d Landauer told me. That is, they have grasped something profound about reality that is not limited to a specific place or time or thing.\n So it seems that Shannon saw deeply not only into the mathematics of circuits, but also into the workings of nature. Information theorist  Thomas Coveronce wrote that Shannon belongs \u201cin the top handful of creative minds of the century. \u201dSome of Shannon \u2019s original theorems, Cover noted, were not actually proved rigorously. But over time, details in the sketchy proofs have been filled in and Shannon \u2019s intuitive insights stand confirmed. \u201cShannon \u2019s intuition, \u201dCover concluded,  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:45:55", "tags": "\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba,shannon,\u9999\u519c", "title": "\u514b\u52b3\u5fb7\u00b7\u9999\u519c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840", "title_en": "How Claude Shannon\u2019s information theory built the foundation for the digital era", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/claude-shannon-information-theory-digital-era", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba", "shannon", "\u9999\u519c"]}]
