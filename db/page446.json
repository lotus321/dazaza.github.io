"note_en": "Spatial analysis is a type of  GIS analysis that uses math and geometry to understand patterns that happen over space and time, including patterns of human behavior and natural phenomena.\n When performing spatial analysis or  spatial data science, the right tools can open a world of free and collaborative analytics capabilities without costly software licenses.\n We are going to give you a quick tour of some of the open source  P ython libraries available for geospatial analysis. All of these libraries can be easily integrated with  JupyterLab and scale to large datasets.\n    In GIS, the term \u201cvector\u201d describes discrete geometries (points, lines, polygons) with related attribute data (e.g. name, county identifier, population). We can use different geometries to represent the same phenomena depending on our scale and level of measurement. For instance, we can represent the White House as either a point, line, or polygon depending on whether we want to look at a building point-of-interest, building outline, or building footprint.\n   GeoPandas is all about making it easy to work with geospatial data in Python. It expands on the built-in pandas data types within a new data structure called the  GeoDa taFrame. GeoPandas wraps the foundational Python packages Shapely and Fiona, both great packages created by  Sean Gillies.\n  Moving down in the stack from GeoPandas,  Shapely wraps GEOS and defines the actual geometry objects (points, lines, polygons) and the spatial relationships between them (e.g.  adjacency,  within,  contains). You can use shapely directly without GeoPandas, but in a dataframe-centric world, Shapely is less of a direct tool and more a dependency for higher-level packages.\n  Fiona can read and write many kinds of geospatial vector data and easily integrates with other Python GIS libraries. It relies on OGR / GEOS for reading shapefiles, geopackages, geojson, topojson, KML, GML from both the local filesystem and cloud services like Amazon S3 by wrapping Python\u2019s boto3 library.\n   Spatialpandas supports Pandas and Dask extensions for vector-based spatial and geometric operations. It is a good tool for working with vectorized geometric algorithms using Numba or Python. The library was first used for polygon rasterization with  Data shader and since has become its own standalone project.\n   Rasters are regularly gridded datasets like GeoTIFFs, JPGs, and PNGs. Regular grids are useful in representing continuous phenomena that are not cleanly represented by points, lines, and polygons. For instance, in analyzing weekly rainfall for Seattle, we would first start with weather station rainfall measurements (points), and interpolate values to create a raster (continuous-surface) to represent rainfall over the entire city.\n   GDAL is the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library which contains input, output, and analysis functions for over 200 geospatial data formats. It supports APIs for all popular programming languages and includes a CLI (command line interface) for quick raster processing tasks (resampling, type conversion, etc.).\n  Rasterio, another creation from the prolific Sean Gilles, is a wrapper around GDAL for use within the Python scientific data stack and integrates well with  X array and  Nump y. It can read, write, organize and store several raster formats like Cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs (COG). A key goal is to provide high-performance and reduced cognitive load for Python developers by using a familiar syntax.\n    Datashaderis a general-purpose rasterization pipeline. We \u2019ve mentioned the difference between vector and raster. What if you want to convert from a vector type to a raster type? This is where Datashader comes in and allows you to intelligently grid your data. Datashader has tools that make it easy to create graphics pipelines with a little bit of code and is an ideal tool for a principled approach to data science. It can handle large datasets and allows users to generate meaningful  ...\n   Xarray-Spatialimplements common raster analysis functions using Numba and provides a codebase that is easy to install and extend. It originated from the Datashader project and includes tools for surface analysis (e.g. slope, curvature, hillshade, viewshed), proximity analysis (e.g. euclidean distance, great circle distance), and zonal / focal analysis (summary statistics by region or neighborhood). It is not dependent on GDAL or GEOS and was created to support core raster analysis  ...\n     RTree wraps the C library  libspatialindex for building and querying large indexes of rectangles.\u00a0 Most times rectangles represent the bounding boxes of polygons which makes the RTree library essential for fast point-in-polygon operations.\u00a0 One downside of this library is that the underlying C/C++ code is not thread-safe.\u00a0 This can cause problems when trying to access the same index from different threads or processes, but still a very useful tool which Geopandas also wraps.\n  PyProj is useful for map projections, which define how we distort a 3D world converting to a 2D map. PyProj wraps the Proj4 library and performs cartographic transformations between coordinate reference systems like WGS84 (longitude / latitude) and UTM (meters west / meters north).\u00a0 Map projections can be difficult to understand and PyProj does a great job.\n  There are many tools at our disposal to do geospatial data analysis and visualizations. Although we just highlighted some tools in the Python stack, geospatial analysis is not limited to Python.\n Python\u2019s motto is \u201cProgramming for Everybody\u201d and this certainly holds true for the geo community. Python is the first language for many aspiring data scientists and we hope this list will help you on your geo-journey.\n  Do you have any questions, suggestions, or Python/non-Python stacks you love doing your spatial analysis with?\n  Do you have questions about how to implement these free tools?

Microsoft, which is considered the No. 2 cloud infrastructure provider, doesn&#39;t disclose revenue, although it said on Wednesday that revenue from the Azure cloud  grew 59% in the quarter.\n AWS delivered 13.5% of Amazon&#39;s total revenue. Launched in 2006, AWS is now bigger than all of Oracle, which was founded almost 30 years earlier. Oracle  reported quarterly revenue last month of $9.8 billion.\n Operating income from AWS totaled $3.08 billion, which was up 38% and above the $2.96 billion FactSet consensus estimate. That works out to 77% of Amazon&#39;s overall operating income.\n  Goldman Sachs analysts led by Heath Terry, who have a buy rating on Amazon stock, raised their estimates for first- and second-quarter AWS revenue in a note distributed to clients last week.\n  &#34;Our partner checks continue to reflect the relative strength in the AWS platform, as incremental demand from customers to accelerate their migration into the cloud, provide full virtual-desktop coverage (AWS WorkSpaces), and other work-from-home and business continuity needs, seem to have more than offset the disruption from longer sales cycles and delays in planned\u00a0migrations as IT priorities have shifted in the current environment,&#34; the analysts wrote.\n  AWS came close to the $10 billion mark in the fourth quarter, when it delivered  $9.95 billion in revenue.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:49:32", "tags": "\u5b63\u5ea6,revenue,aws", "title": "AWS\u5b63\u5ea6\u6536\u5165\u9996\u6b21\u7a81\u7834100\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143", "title_en": "AWS tops $10B in quarterly revenue for the first time", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/30/aws-earnings-q1-2020.html", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u5b63\u5ea6", "revenue", "aws"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000085, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u57fa\u4e8eAWS Lambda\u3001AWS HTTP API\u3001Express.js\u3001Reaction\u548cDynamoDB\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3001\u5168\u5806\u6808\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n\u8bf7\u786e\u4fdd\u60a8\u5df2\u767b\u5f55\u3002CD\u653e\u5165\u4efb\u4f55\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6587\u4ef6\u5939(\u4f8b\u5982API\u3001Site\u7b49)\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8fd0\u884cSLS\u767b\u5f55\u3002\n\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u90e8\u7f72\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5efa\u8bae\u53ea\u90e8\u7f72\u60a8\u8981\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5168\u90e8\u4e00\u8d77\u90e8\u7f72(\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u5192\u9669\u5728\u66f4\u6539\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90e8\u7f72\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5462\uff1f)\u3002\u8981\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u8bf7\u7528cd\u8fdb\u5165\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fd0\u884c\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\n\u5728\u4f7f\u7528./api\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f3a\u70c8\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u8be5\u547d\u4ee4\u76d1\u89c6\u60a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u90e8\u7f72\u5b83\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06console.log()\u8bed\u53e5\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u5b9e\u65f6\u5730\u76f4\u63a5\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u60a8\u7684CLI\uff01\n\u5982\u679c\u8981\u5c06\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u767b\u5f55\u9875\u9762\u548cAPI\uff0c\u8bf7\u5728serverless.yml\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u786c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5728serverless.yml\u4e2d\u5f15\u7528\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5982\u4e0b\u6240\u793a\uff1a\n\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528.env\u6587\u4ef6(\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u540e\u53f0\u6587\u4ef6\u540d\u79f0)\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u540e\u53f0\u6587\u4ef6\u6dfb\u52a0\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\uff1a", "note_en": "A complete, serverless, full-stack application built on AWS Lambda, AWS HTTP API, Express.js, React and DynamoDB.\n      Make sure you are logged in.  cd into any component folders (e.g.  api,  site, etc.) and run  sls login.\n  After initial deployment, we recommend deploying only the parts you are changing, not the entire thing together (why risk deploying your database with a code change?).

I struggled for a while writing about this subject, because there is no right way to do it. However, every other week people ask me about how I structure my React projects. Not only about folder structures for small React projects, but more importantly about scalable React applications. After implementing React applications for a few years now, I want to give you a breakdown on how I approach this matter for my  ...\n For anyone who says &#34;I move files around until it feels right&#34;: This may be alright as a solo developer or in a small team. But is that really something you would do in a cross-functional team of 4 developers with a total of 5 cross-functional teams in your company? At a higher scale of teams it becomes tricky to &#34;just move files around without a clear vision&#34;. In addition, this is nothing I could tell my clients when they ask me about this matter. Hence this walkthrough as reference  ...\n  The first step follows the rule: One file to rule them all. Most React projects start with a  src/ folder and one  src/App.js file with an App component. At least that&#39;s what you get when you are using  create-react-app. This App  function component just renders something:\n  Eventually this component adds more features, it naturally grows in size, and needs to extract parts of it as standalone React components. Here we are extracting a  React list component with another child component from the App component:\n  Whenever you start with a new React project, I tell people it&#39;s fine to have multiple components in one file. It&#39;s even fine in a larger React application, whenever one component is strictly tight to another one. However, in this scenario, eventually your one file will not be sufficient anymore for your React project. That&#39;s when we transition to step two.\n  The second step follows the rule: Multiple files to rule them all. Take for instance our previous App component with its List and ListItem components: Rather than having everything in one  src/App.js file, we can split these components up into multiple files. You decide how far you want to take it here. For example, I would go with the following folder structure:\n  While the  src/List.js file would have the implementation details of the List and ListItem components, it would only  export the List component from the file as public API to this file:\n    If you would take this one step further, you could also extract the ListItem component into its own file and let the List component import the ListItem component:\n  However, as said before, this may take it too far, because so far the ListItem component is tightly coupled to the List component. Hence it would be okay to leave it in the  src/List.js file. I follow the rule of thumb that whenever a React component becomes a  reusable React component, I split it out as a standalone file, like we did with the List component, to make it accessible for other React components.\n  From here it becomes more interesting and more opinionated. Every React component grows in complexity eventually. Not only because more logic is added (e.g. more JSX with  conditional rendering or  React Hooks), but also because there are more technical concerns like styling and tests. A naive approach would be to add more files next to each React component. For example, let&#39;s say every React component has a test and a style file:\n  One can already see that this doesn&#39;t scale well, because with every additional component in the  src/ folder we will lose more sight of every individual component. That&#39;s why I like to have one folder for each React component:\n  The naming of these files is up to you. For example,  index.js may become  component.js or  test.js may become  spec.js. Moreover, if you are not using CSS but something like  Styled Components, your file extension may change from  style.css to  style.js too. Once you get used to your naming convention, you can just search for &#34;List index&#34; or &#34;App test&#34; in your IDE for opening each file. If you collapse all component folders, you have a very concise and clear folder structure:\n  If there are more technical concerns for a component, for example you may want to extract custom hooks into their own file for certain components, you can scale this approach horizontally within the component folder:\n  If you decide to keep your  List/index.js more lightweight by extracting the ListItem component in its own file, then you may want to try the following folder structure:\n  Here again you can go one step further by giving the component its own folder with all other technical concerns like tests and styles:\n  Important: From here on you need to be careful to not nest too deeply your components into each other. My rule of thumb is that I am never nesting components more than two levels, so the List and ListItem folders would be alright, but the ListItem&#39;s folder shouldn&#39;t have another nested folder.\n After all, if you are not going beyond midsize React projects, this is in my opinion the way to go to structure your React components. However, as I mentioned, this is highly opinionated and may not meet everyones taste.\n  The next step will help you to structure midsize to large React applications. It separates features from components which are used by more than one component. Take the following folder structure as example:\n  We group our previous React components into a new  components/ folder. This gives us another vertical layer for creating folders for other categories. For example, at some point you may have React Hooks that can be used by more than one component. So instead of coupling the hook tightly to a component, you can put the implementation of it in a dedicated folder which can be used by all React components:\n  This doesn&#39;t mean that all hooks should end up in this folder though. React Hooks which are still only used by one component should remain in the component&#39;s file or maybe in a separate  hooks.js file in the component&#39;s folder. Only hooks that can be consumed by all React components end up in the  hooks/ folder.\n The same strategy may apply if you are using  React Context in your project which needs to be accessed globally by all your other files:\n  From here, there may be other utilities which need to be accessible to your components and hooks. For miscellaneous utilities I usually create a  services/ folder. The name is up to you, but again it&#39;s the principal of making logic available to other code in our project which drives this technical separation:\n    Fortunately  JavaScript&#39;s Intl API gives us excellent tools for date conversions. However, instead of using the API directly in my React components, I like to have a service for it, because only this way I can guarantee that my components have only a slim set of actively used date formatting options available for my application. Otherwise there would be lots of different date formats in a growing application.\n   But also as a service, as an encapsulated module in other words, what I usually like to do:\n  It may become difficult to import things with relative paths now. Therefore I always would opt-in  Babel&#39;s Module Resolver for aliases. Afterward, your import may look like the following:\n  After all, I like this technical separation of concerns, because it gives every folder a dedicated purpose and it encourages sharing functionality across the application.\n  The last step will help you to structure large React applications. This happens when you find yourself with lots of subfolders in your technical separated folders. The example doesn&#39;t show the full extent, but I hope you get the point:\n  From here I would use the  components/ folder only for reusable components (e.g. UI components). Every other component should move to a domain centred folder. The names of the folders are again up to you:\n  If a PaymentForm needs access to a Button or Input, it imports it from the reusable UI components folder. If a MessageList component needs an abstract List component, it imports it as well. Furthermore, if a service from the previous step is tightly coupled to a domain, then move the service to the specific domain folder. The same may apply to other folders which were previously separated by technical concern:\n  Whether there should be an intermediate  services/ folder in each domain folder is up to you. You could also leave out the folder and put the  ErrorTracking/ folder directly into  Error/. However, this may be confusing, because ErrorTracking should be marked somehow as a service and not as a React component. As alternative you could also use a  kebab-case naming convention, which is better than PascalCase anyway, by going with  error-tracking/ instead of  ErrorTracking/.\n There is lots of room for your personal touch here. After all, this step is just about bringing the domains together which allows teams in your company to work on specific domains without having to touch files across the project.\n  Having all this written, I hope it helps one or the other person or team structuring their React project. Keep in mind that none of the shown approaches is set in stone. In contrast, I encourage you to apply your personal touch to it. Since every React project grows in size over time, most of the folder structures evolve very naturally as well. Hence the 5 step process to give you some guidance if things get out of hand.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:49:23", "tags": "\u53cd\u5e94,react,\u7ec4\u4ef6,component", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u57285\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53cd\u5e94\u9879\u76ee", "title_en": "How to structure React projects in 5 steps", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u53cd\u5e94", "react", "\u7ec4\u4ef6", "component"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000083, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u636e\u201c\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u62a5\u201d\u5468\u4e09\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u79df\u8d41\u516c\u53f8\u8d6b\u5179(Hertz)\u6b63\u5728\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u7834\u4ea7\u7533\u8bf7\u505a\u51c6\u5907\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u7684\u65c5\u884c\u9677\u5165\u505c\u6ede\u3002\n\u77e5\u60c5\u4eba\u58eb\u544a\u8bc9\u8be5\u62a5\uff0c\u8d6b\u5179\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u51cf\u5c11\u503a\u52a1\u507f\u8fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u6b63\u5728\u5c31\u4e00\u9879\u5bbd\u5bb9\u534f\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\u8c08\u5224\uff0c\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5176\u907f\u514d\u7834\u4ea7\u3002\u6839\u636e\u201c\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u62a5\u201d\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u60c5\u51b5\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\n\u8d6b\u5179\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u5728\u5468\u4e09\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u4e0b\u8dcc\u8d85\u8fc715%\uff0c\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u62a5\u62a5\u9053\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6307\u6570\u4e0a\u6da8\u3002\n\u5728\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u4ea7\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u5929\u524d\uff0c\u8d6b\u5179\u5468\u4e00\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u76d1\u7ba1\u7533\u62a5\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4ecd\u5728\u4e0e\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u8ba8\u8bba\u51cf\u5c11\u652f\u4ed8\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6ca1\u6709\u5728\u8fd0\u8425\u79df\u8d41\u4e0a\u652f\u4ed8\u67d0\u4e9b\u6b3e\u9879\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8ba8\u8bba\u57285\u6708\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u5468\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u8d6b\u5179\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n4\u6708\u521d\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u89e3\u96c7\u4e861\u4e07\u540d\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u7ea6\u53602019\u5e74\u5e95\u5458\u5de5\u603b\u6570\u768426%\uff0c\u4ee5\u52aa\u529b\u4f7f\u5458\u5de5\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u65c5\u884c\u9700\u6c42\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\n\u8d6b\u5179\u7684\u4e00\u540d\u4ee3\u8868\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u201c\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u62a5\u201d\u7684\u62a5\u9053\u53d1\u8868\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u5c31\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6587\u4ef6\u53d1\u8868\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u58f0\u660e\uff1a\n\u4ed6\u4eec\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u4ee5\u53ca\u590d\u82cf\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u529b\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8d6b\u5179\u6b63\u5728\u91c7\u53d6\u79ef\u6781\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5176\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u3002\u6839\u636e\u65c5\u884c\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u524a\u51cf\u5f00\u652f\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdf\u8d44\u672c\u652f\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u914d\u5907\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u76848\u516c\u91cc\u4eca\u5929\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u8f66\u8f86\u878d\u8d44\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u7684\u8c08\u5224\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4ecd\u5728\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\u2026\u3002\n\u6469\u6839\u5927\u901a(JPMorgan)\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u745e\u5b89\u00b7\u5e03\u6797\u514b\u66fc(Ryan Brinkman)\u57284\u670823\u65e5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u653f\u5e9c\u63f4\u52a9\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8d6b\u5179\u4fdd\u6301\u507f\u4ed8\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n\u4ed6\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u7ed9\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u786e\u5b9e\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u653f\u5e9c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5411\u8d6b\u5179\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u5927\u7b14\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u4f55\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6211\u4eec\u4e5f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6761\u6b3e\u3002", "note_en": "Car-rental company Hertz is preparing for a potential bankruptcy filing,  The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, as the coronavirus pandemic brings nearly all travel to a standstill.\n People familiar with the matter told the paper that Hertz is working to reduce its debt payments and is in talks on a forbearance agreement that could help it avoid bankruptcy.

"note_en": "The Mustang community is mourning the great loss of an automotive icon that lost his short battle with liver cancer.\n Gale Halderman is a legendary name in the Ford Mustang world. Not only did Gale take pride working at Ford Motor Company for 40 years, but he was also a member of the Mustang Hall of Fame. Last but most certainly not least, Gale was the main designer of the original Ford Mustang. Sadly, the car community is mourning a great loss as Gale Halderman just passed away at the age of 87 after a short battle with liver cancer.\n  The night before Gale had a big meeting about Lee Iacocca&#39;s new concept car called the  Ford Mustang, he stayed up late at his kitchen table and sketched out his idea. He knew that it needed to have a few attributes. The new  Mustangneeded to be sporty, exciting, and appeal to both genders. A long hood with a short deck would be ideal. The heat was on as many other Ford designers were also sketching out their very own ideas for the cat. Gale and his boss Jim Oros collaborated and worked on their  ...\n We have to give credit where credit is due. Who knows where Ford&#39;s iconic pony car would stand today if Gale&#39;s sketch wasn&#39;t chosen and ultimately turned into the 1965 (or 1964 1/2)  Ford Mustang, an iconic classic that is as much of an American staple as apple pie. If you want to go even deeper, the modern Mustang would \u00a0probably look nothing like it does today if it weren&#39;t for the original car designed by Gale, and even more, it is quite possible that the  Mustangname may not  ...\n Gale&#39;s legacy goes even further than that. He was employed with Ford Motor Company for a long four decades as a designer or designer executive. The word legend isn&#39;t lightly tossed around as he had worked alongside the top names at Ford such as Henry Ford II, Hal Sperlich, and of course, Lee Iacocca. Bill Ford Jr. once answered to Gale as his boss at one point in time during his time at the Blue Oval.\n   Once Gale eventually retired from the Blue Oval, he dedicated his time to turn their family barn into a museum all about the car&#39;s design. Since Gale was a humble man, this wasn&#39;t a way to showcase his own work, but a place where he could mostly showcase the work of others. We could all certainly agree that we wouldn&#39;t mind to see a museum dedicated to Gale and his many accomplishments. The walls are adorned with sketches, concepts, and designs collected over time from talented artists  ...\n Gale was a legend and left a legacy. He is survived by three daughters, nine grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. Not only that, he is survived by the countless individuals considered his Mustang family over the past 55 years. Rest in peace, Gale Halderman.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:49:08", "tags": "\u798f\u7279,\u8bbe\u8ba1,\u91ce\u9a6c,ford,gale", "title":

"Health Officers caution that reducing restrictions too quickly could lead to a substantial resurgence of COVID-19\n          Santa Clara County, CA \u2013\u00a0The seven Bay Area Public Health Officers who ordered a shelter in place in mid-March will  extend the orders through May 31while some restrictions are eased and tools to strengthen containment of COVID-19 are put into place. The social distancing intervention has slowed the increase of new cases and prevented the anticipated medical surge. As restrictions are eased, it is critical to ensure that growth of cases can be sufficiently contained to protect the  ...\n  All construction activities, certain businesses that operate primarily outdoors, and some outdoor activities will be allowed to resume with specific conditions.\n  These new Health Officer orders, which take effect May 4, cover everyone living or working in the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara as well as the City of Berkeley, an independent public health jurisdiction. As of April 28, 2020, there are 7,273 confirmed cases (up from 258 confirmed cases on March 15, 2020) and 266 deaths (up from 4 deaths on March 15, 2020) in the seven Bay Area jurisdictions jointly issuing this Order.\n  This next phase reflects regional progress, thanks to the collective action Bay Area residents have taken since mid-March in response to Health Officer shelter-in-place orders. Those actions have saved lives and staved off mass hospitalizations from the COVID-19 virus, which spreads easily and causes severe illness in many people.\u00a0 There is not yet an effective treatment or cure for the disease.\n  This initial, measured easing of some restrictions is designed to set the stage for a gradual resumption of activity and prevent rapid, exponential growth of cases that could overwhelm hospitals for a particular jurisdiction or the region as a whole.\n  &#34;This impact of the virus has been hard for many of us, but we are now on a path for steady progress, which now allows some low-risk activities to return,&#34; said Dr. Lisa B. Hernandez, Health Officer for the City of Berkeley. &#34;This virus is still in our communities. We need everyone to shelter-in-place apart from the few exceptions \u2013 and wear a face covering when out.&#34;\n  &#34;The new order allows us to carefully monitor our progress while building the essential public health infrastructure \u2013 such as contact tracing and testing capacity \u2013 that will support our gradual reopening and make recovery possible,&#34; said Dr. Tom\u00e1s Aragon, Health Officer for the City and County of San Francisco.\n  Under the new orders, all construction projects will be allowed to resume as long as the project complies with safety protocols included with the order.\u00a0 All real estate transactions will also now be able to resume, but with continued restrictions on open houses and limitations on in-person viewings.\u00a0 Any employee allowed to return to work at a facility can also access childcare programs that can operate.\n  Certain outdoor businesses can also begin operating again, and people can visit those businesses to perform work or obtain goods, services, or supplies.\u00a0 This includes wholesale and retail nurseries, landscapers, gardeners, and other businesses that primarily provide outdoor services as set forth in the order.\u00a0 Outdoor businesses do not include restaurants, cafes or bars, regardless of whether they have outdoor seating.\n  Other activities that can resume under the new order include residential moves and the use of certain shared outdoor recreational facilities that were previously ordered closed, like skate parks, but not others that involve shared equipment or physical contact.\n  These orders are generally consistent with the state&#39;s shelter in place order.\u00a0 On any issue where the local and state orders may differ, the stricter order applies.\n  These orders are generally consistent with the state&#39;s shelter in place order.\u00a0 On any issue where the local and state orders may differ, the stricter order applies.\n              Health Officers are also releasing  indicators\u200b that will be used to measure progress in containing the virus and ensuring we have the infrastructure in place to protect the community from COVID-19.\u00a0 These indicators will be critical to decisions in the coming weeks and months about when and how to ease shelter-in-place restrictions.\n    Whether there is an adequate supply of personal protective equipment for all health care workers;\n  Whether we are meeting the need for testing, especially for persons in vulnerable populations or those in high-risk settings or occupations; and\n  Whether we have the capacity to investigate all COVID-19 cases and trace all of their contacts, isolating those who test positive and quarantining the people who may have been exposed.\n  &#34;A pandemic of this scale is unprecedented,&#34; said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County Health Officer. &#34;We are progressing steadily as a region, but we must reduce restrictions on activity gradually or we will put the lives of many community members at risk.&#34;\n                                      \r\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:49:00", "tags":

money but the state won&#39;t get a say: this is a concise summary of what Lufthansa&#39;s Executive Board, headed by CEO Carsten Spohr, has been telling German politicians in the past few weeks.\n According to an investigation by Business Insider, Lufthansa is now so up to its neck in water, the airline&#39;s management had to come to an agreement with the German state on the afternoon of Monday, April 27, after hours of negotiations.\n The agreement entails the state using $10 billion to bail out Germany&#39;s last remaining international airline.\n    It&#39;s expected that one or two supervisory board mandates will be given to the German federal government.\n  However, as a result of the worldwide travel restrictions in the Corona crisis, Lufthansa is currently making losses of around $1 million every hour.\n  Founded in 1953, Lufthansa began flight operations two years later and was, until 1963, entirely in state hands.\n   The federal government, however, sold its shares in the mid-1990s, so Lufthansa has been fully privatized since 1997.\n  According to the investigation, the state is pumping just under $10 billion into the badly hit company.\n In return, the government, as the new shareholder, will receive a blocking minority and one or two supervisory board seats, but these will not be filled by civil servants or politicians.\n Formally, the company will then be associated with the Federal Ministry of Finance as a state holding.\n     The most crucial factor in the agreement was that the appointment of civil servants or politicians to the supervisory board was unacceptable in the eyes of Lufthansa&#39;s executives.\n  Spohr himself didn&#39;t officially take part in yesterday&#39;s talks but on Tuesday, he wants to formally seal the deal with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany&#39;s finance minister, Olaf Scholz.\n Through the investigation, Business Insider learned that it&#39;s unlikely the matter will be negotiated again.\n   Spohr had recently proposed an Airbus model for Lufthansa. Germany, France, and Spain hold a quarter of the shares of the aircraft manufacturer but don&#39;t exercise any direct influence over the company.\n  Read the original article on  Business Insider Deutschland.

the California state COVID-19 emergency response website in collaboration with the CHHS Office of Innovation and the California Department of Technology.\n  Our challenge: Create a scalable, accessible, stable website that is easy to update in a fast changing public health crisis. And do it in four days.\n  This challenge is one that will be familiar to our digital colleagues working in other states, cities and countries right now. We\u2019ve been super impressed by and appreciative of the work being done in places like  San Francisco,  New Jersey and the  United Kingdom.\n  Just like those teams, we\u2019ve been focused on prioritizing user needs in this time of crisis. And we thought it could be useful to share out how we\u2019ve been using technology/development decisions to do this.\n  For our team, we started by returning to one of our core principles: \u201cAlways accessible.\u201d\n  We recognize, of course, that \u201cAlways accessible\u201d is not a novel approach. Here in California accessibility is a guiding principle in the state\u2019s digital strategy. And our work is just one part of the state\u2019s larger commitment to ensuring that information and services are accessible.\n  What is novel is how our team is broadening the definition of accessibility for state government to include performance as a core component. Performance as accessibility.\n  Our goal is to make COVID19.CA.gov fast and easy to use on any kind of hardware or with any level of bandwidth.\n  We\u2019re not yet 100% accessible \u2013 but accessibility is 100% our north star and what we are working toward every day.\n      We run automated audits which give us performance and accessibility scores on every build. Getting a high score on these automated tools is a good initial indicator, but not the whole story. We also manually test sites, ensuring we remain accessible via alternative navigation modes. We test with screen readers, which gives us a sense of how our site is experienced by site-impaired users. This helps find and eliminate interactions that might trap or slow people down.\n  We\u2019re grateful for support from the  California Department of Rehabilitation. The DOR team trained us to use those screen readers and has been instrumental helping us understand and avoid many common issues often created accidentally.\n  And we\u2019re grateful to the CHHS Office of Innovation whose team members are the frontline in our work to make our content accessible and clear.\n    Fast sites are more successful than slow ones. And some tools make it easier than others to produce fast sites.\n  Our team uses Bootstrap, which by default, is quite large. So we make sure to run CSS pruning processes to trim out all unused code before deploying to production. We also avoid the Bootstrap javascript widgets because we prefer using small, low dependency Web Components.\n    Delivering the desired layout and interactivity with a small code footprint allows us to hit our performance goals more easily. We create light frontend interactivity by publishing Web Components. When we have to build our own we use some of the  open-wc build tools that help by providing models for running components in isolation and integrated testing patterns.\n  We are mostly depending on the custom element part of the web component standard. This lets us easily use components on different properties with an npm install and using the tag on a page, allowing us to provide the maximum amount of flexibility and reuse. Building new frontend properties using Web Components is a user-first choice for many reasons:\n  Web Components can be modified in isolation and versioned so consumers can choose which versions to install\n  These advantages give new code a better chance for longevity and higher probability that our current efforts are providing future benefit instead of technical debt.\n  We are aware that building our own  components when necessary is a big decision. We only undertake this when we can\u2019t find existing options that use dependencies sparingly and provide the required UI. When creating new components we run tests\u00a0 in browsers, down to IE11, as well as ensuring they adhere to all of our other standards for accessibility and performance.\n    We\u2019re proud to have achieved a high score on our  Lighthouse performance audit but that isn\u2019t enough for government tools, especially in this time of crisis.\n  We need to go above and beyond to ensure that all users are able to get a performant experience, no matter their device. This is especially true since users aren\u2019t able to shop around for a different, better government experience.\n  So we picked up the cheapest phone they had at Cricket Wireless. A $20 device running Android 9, with no contract commitment has been one of the most useful and effective tools in our effort to be accessible.\n  The experience on this device is pretty different from what we see on the newest iPhones or Google Pixel devices. Pages delivering a lot of javascript are slow to render and respond to interaction, any scroll triggered effects look terrible and not actually cool (like they look on a new iPhone). Even swiping quickly through long, complex pages can be frustrating and slow as the device struggles to render lots of content.\n  Leaner, faster sites benefit  everybody, but making sure your applications run smoothly on low-end hardware makes a massive difference for those users.\n    As we add new features, it can be difficult to keep tabs on how our performance is changing. As well as using Lighthouse, we\u2019ve introduced Calibre to our reporting, as this enabled us to keep our builds fast. We\u2019re able to trigger performance and accessibility reports on each build with a process running outside of the build itself.\n      We can use this same data to report to our dashboards. This helps us with visibility to the whole team, not just the engineers.\n      Alex Russell, Senior Staff Software Engineer for Chrome at Google, kindly  analyzed the covid19.ca.gov site. He identified some areas for improvement with our fonts and integration with Google Analytics.\n  We were stoked to have\u00a0 Alex\u2019s deep expertise benefit COVID19.CA.gov. And we\u2019re deeply appreciative of his advocacy to pay attention to performance.\n  Overall, Alex found that the covid19.ca.gov site was fast, rendered quickly and finished all operations faster than similar sites, which helps users get the information they need quickly and easily.\n        API endpoints running on FAAS allow us to keep our backend code in isolated, cheap, scalable components. The  @CAdotGov team is running infrastructure mostly on Azure.  Carter Medlin set up the first APIs on Azure\u2019s FAAS services.\n      Covid19.ca.gov received millions of visitors in the hours after Governor Newsom announced the statewide Stay at Home Order.\n  The site was able to handle this level of traffic easily because we removed every unnecessary piece from the production service pipeline. This provided us with peace of mind ahead of launch, lowers costs and improves stability. While our content is constantly updated and deployed automatically, we create a pregenerated version of the final build each time so that production systems serve the body of pages as static  ...\n  We chose  11ty as our static content generator because we like their philosophy and emphasis on performance and accessibility. Making the production build a set of static files removes a lot of common bottlenecks. Scaling concerns are radically simplified because the initial content is delivered without database connections or even any server side code execution.\n  Removing complexity and risk from the production pipeline doesn\u2019t require us to forego any interactivity or force us to abandon mature open source tools.\n  We are making the choice to run all computation possible before deployment. We are still using APIs for data driven interactions, such as the  Telehealth provider lookups page. Content is authored in our private WordPress repository and the output is integrated with 11ty, so we don\u2019t run PHP on public servers.\n    We chose WordPress for their premier authoring environment but decided not to use it as a content delivery tool. This allowed us to take advantage of the mature writing tools WordPress provides without needing to support any of its dependencies in our production environment.\n  We were able to decouple WordPress authoring from reading by using its built in API. We set its publish trigger to notify our Function as a Service (FAAS) service when content was updated. Our  FAAS tool moved the post content from WordPress to Github.\n  We then used  a Github Action to trigger 11ty builds and deploy to a browseable github pages branch which then triggers the deploy to our Azure production environment\n      We know that the COVID-19 pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint. We\u2019re mindful there\u2019s more work to do in the coming weeks and months. And our team is looking forward to continuing to meet the challenge of this moment by ensuring that the people of California get the information they need quickly and easily.", "posttime": "2020-05-02

"note_en": "Last week, we started at 1 and slowly and steadily worked our way up to 1,000,000. We used dots. It was cute.\n  Before things get totally out of hand, let\u2019s start by working our way up the still-fathomable powers of 10\u2014\n  When we went from 1 to 1,000,000, we didn\u2019t need powers\u2014we could just use a short string of digits to represent the numbers we were talking about. If we wanted to multiply a number by 10, we just added a zero.\n But as you advance past a million, zeros start to become plentiful and you need a different notation. That\u2019s why we use powers. When people talk about exponential growth, they\u2019re referring to the craziness that can happen when you start using powers. For example:\n  As we get bigger and bigger today, we\u2019ll stick with powers of 10, because when you start talking about really big numbers, what becomes relevant is the number of digits, not the digits themselves\u2014i.e. every 70-digit number is somewhere between 10 69 and 10 70, which is really all you need to know. So for at least the first part of this post, the powers of 10 can serve nicely as orders-of-magnitude \u201ccheckpoints\u201d.\n Each time we up the power by one, we multiply the world we\u2019re in by ten, changing things significantly. Let\u2019s start off where we left off last time\u2014\n 10 6 (1 million \u2013 1,000,000) \u2013 The amount of dots in that  huge image we finished up with last week. On my computer screen, that image was about 18cm x 450cm = .81 m 2 in area.\n 10 7 (10 million) \u2013 This brings us to a range that includes the number of steps it would take to walk around the Earth (40 million steps). If each of your steps around the Earth were represented by a dot like those from the grids in the last post, the dots would fill a 6m x 6m square.\n 10 8 (100 million) \u2013 Now we\u2019re at the number of books  ever published in human history (130 million), and at the top of this range, the  estimatednumber of words a human being speaks in a lifetime (860 million). Also in this range are the odds of winning the really big lotteries. A recent Mega Millions lottery had 1-in-175,711,536 odds of winning. To put those chances in perspective, that \u2019s about the number of seconds in six years. So it \u2019s like knowing a hedgehog will sneeze once and  ...\n 10 9 (1 billion 1  \u2013 1,000,000,000) \u2013 Here we have the number of seconds in a century (about 3 billion), the number of living humans (7.125 billion), and to fit a billion dots, our dot image would cover two basketball courts.\n 10 10 (10 billion) \u2013 Now we\u2019re up to the years since the Big Bang (13.7 billion) and the number of seconds since Jesus Christ lived (60 billion).\n 10 11 (100 billion) \u2013 This is about the number of stars in the Milky Way and the number of galaxies in the observable universe (100-400 billion)\u2014so if a computer listed one observable galaxy every second since Christ, it wouldn\u2019t be anywhere close to finished currently.\n 10 12 (1 trillion \u2013 1,000,000,000,000) \u2013 A million millions. The amount of pounds the scale would show if you put the whole human race on it (~1 trillion), the number of seconds humans have been around (~100,000 years = ~3 trillion seconds), and larger than both of those totals combined, the number of miles in one light year (6 trillion). A trillion is so big that you\u2019d only need 4 trillion millimeters of ribbon to tie a bow around the sun.\n 10 13 (10 trillion) \u2013 This is about as big as we can get for numbers we hear discussed in the real world, and it\u2019s almost always related to nations and dollars\u2014the US nominal GDP in 2013 was just under $17 trillion, and its debt is currently just under $18 trillion. Both of those are dwarfed by the number of cells in the human body (37 trillion).\n 10 14 (100 trillion) \u2013 100 trillion is about the number of letters in every published book in human history, as well as the number of bacteria in your body. 2 Also in this range is the total wealth of the world ($241 trillion, which we discussed  at great length in a previous post).\n 10 15 (1 quadrillion) \u2013 Okay goodbye normal words. People say the words million, billion, and trillion a lot. No one says quadrillion. It\u2019s really uncool to say the word quadrillion. 3 Most people opt for \u201ca million billion\u201d instead. Either way, there are about a quadrillion  ants on Earth. Comparing this to the bacteria fact, it\u2019s like you have 1/10th of the world\u2019s ants crawling around inside your body.\n 10 16 (10 quadrillion) \u2013 It\u2019s in this range that we get to the number of playing cards you\u2019d have to accidentally knock off the table to cover the entire Earth (89 quadrillion). People would be mad at you.\n 10 17 (100 quadrillion) \u2013 The number of seconds since the Big Bang.  Also the number of references to Kim Kardashian that entered my soundscape in the last week. Please stop.\n 10 18 (1 quintillion) \u2013 Also known as a billion billion, the word quintillion manages to be even less cool than a quadrillion. No one who has social skills ever says the word quintillion. Anyway, it\u2019s the number of cubic meters of water in all the Earth\u2019s oceans and the number of atoms in a grain of salt (1.2 quintillion). The number of grains of sand on every beach on Earth is about 7.5 quintillion\u2014the same number of atoms in  six grains of salt.\n 10 19 (10 quintillion) \u2013 The number of millimeters from here to the closest next star (38 quintillion millimeters).\n 10 20 (100 quintillion) \u2013 The number of meter-long steps it would take you to walk across the whole Milky Way. So many podcasts. And heard of a Planck volume? It\u2019s the smallest volume scientists talk about, so small you could fit 100 quintillion of them in a  proton. More on Planck volumes later. Oh, and our dot image? By the time we get to 600 quintillion dots, the image would cover the surface of the Earth.\n 10 21 (1 sextillion) \u2013 Now we\u2019re even beyond the vocabulary of the weirdos. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard someone say \u201csextillion\u201d out loud, and I hope to keep it that way.\n 10 23 (100 sextillion) \u2013 A rough estimate  for the number of stars in the observable universe. You also had to deal with this number in high school\u2014602 sextillion, or 6.02 x 10 23\u2014is a mole, or Avogadro\u2019s Number, and the number of hydrogen atoms in a gram of hydrogen.\n  10 25 (10 septillion) \u2013 The number of drops of water in all the world\u2019s oceans.\n 10 27 (1 octillion) \u2013 If the Earth were hollow, it would take 1 octillion peas to pack it full. And I think we\u2019ve heard just about enough from octillion.\n Okay so now let\u2019s take a huge leap forward into a whole different territory\u2014somewhere where the Earth\u2019s volume is too tiny and the Big Bang too recent to use in examples. In this new arena of number, only the observable universe\u2014a sphere about 92 billion light years across\u2014can handle the magnitude we\u2019re dealing with. 4 10 80 \u2013 To get to 10 80, you take trillion and you multiply it by a trillion, by a trillion, by a trillion, by a trillion, by a trillion, by a hundred million.  ...\n 10 86 \u2013 And what if you wanted to pack the entire observable universe sphere with peas? You\u2019d need 10 86 peas to make it happen.\n 10 90 \u2013 This is how many medium size grains of sand (.5mm in diameter) it would take to pack the universe full.\n  The name googol came about when American mathematician Edward Kasner got cute one day in 1938 and asked his 9-year-old nephew Milton to come up with a  ...\n I\u2019m using the American short scale system\u2014in the British long scale system, you don\u2019t get to a billion until 10 12. \u21a9\n   I\u2019m going to use the term \u201cuniverse\u201d to refer to the observable universe so I don\u2019t have to type observable 49 times in this post. \u21a9\n 59 years later, Sergey Brin and Larry Page named their new search engine after this number because they wanted to emphasize the large quantities of information the engine could provide. They spelled it wrong by accident. \u21a9\n   Or a g 65 number of years, which would be (3 [Graham\u2019s number of arrows] 3)\u2026or a g g 64 number of years\u2026I could go on. \u21a9", "posttime":

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  De-extinction, also known as  resurrection biology, or  species revivalism, is the process of generating an  organism that is either an extinct species or resembles an  extinct species.  [1] There are several ways to carry out the process of de-extinction.  Cloning is the most widely proposed method, although genome editing and  selective breeding have also been considered. Similar techniques have been applied to certain  endangered species, in hopes to boost populations.  ...\n     Cloning is a commonly suggested method for the potential restoration of an extinct species. It can be done by extracting the nucleus from a preserved cell from the extinct species and swapping it into an egg, without a nucleus, of that species&#39; nearest living relative.  [3]The egg can then be inserted into a host from the extinct species \u2019nearest living relative. It is important to note that this method can only be used when a preserved cell is available,  ...\n  Genome editing has been rapidly advancing with the help of the CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was originally discovered as part of the bacterial immune system.  [6]Viral DNA that was injected into the bacterium became incorporated into the bacterial chromosome at specific regions. These regions are called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, otherwise known as CRISPR. Since the viral DNA is within  ...\n By using cells from a closely related species to the extinct species, genome editing can play a role in the de-extinction process. Germ cells may be edited directly, so that the egg and sperm produced by the extant parent species will produce offspring of the extinct species, or somatic cells may be edited and transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer. This results in a hybrid between the two species, since it is not completely one animal. Because  ...\n  Back breeding is a form of selective breeding. As opposed to breeding animals for a trait to advance the species in selective breeding, back breeding involves breeding animals for an ancestral characteristic that may not be seen throughout the species as frequently.  [7] This method can recreate the traits of an extinct species, but the genome will differ from the original species.  [4]Back breeding, however, is contingent on the ancestral trait of the  ...\n  A natural process of de-extinction is iterative evolution. This process occurs when a species becomes extinct, but then reappears after some amount of time. An example of this process occurred with the  white-throated rail. This flightless bird became extinct approximately 136,000 years ago due to an unknown event that caused sea levels to rise, which resulted in the demise of the species. The species reappeared about 100,000 years ago when sea levels  ...\n  The technologies being developed for de-extinction could lead to large advancements in scientific technology and process. This includes the advancement of genetic technologies that are used to improve the cloning process for de-extinction. The technologies could be used to prevent endangered species form going extinct.  [11]The study of reintroduced spices could also lead to advancements in science. By studying previously extinct animals cures to diseases  ...\n If de-extinction is prioritized it would lead to the improvement of current conservation strategies. Conservation would be necessary in order to reintroduce a species into the ecosystem. Conservation efforts would be taken initially until the revived population can sustain itself in the wild.  [14]De-extinction could also help improve ecosystems that had been destroyed by human development by introducing an extinct species back into an ecosystem to  ...\n  The reintroduction of previously extinct spices could have negative impact on the ecosystem and other species, Since the species was previously extinct reintroducing it into an ecosystem it could be seen as an invasive species. This could lead to the extinction of living species due to competition for food or  competitive exclusion. It could also lead to the extinction of prey species if they have more predictors in an environment that had few predictors  ...\n De-extinction is a very expensive process. Bringing back one species can coast millions of dollars. The money for de-extinction would most likely come from current conservation efforts. These efforts could be weakened if funding is taken from conservation and put into de-extinction. This would mean that  critically endangeredspecies would start to go extinct faster because there is no longer resources that are need to maintain their populations.  ...\n      The existence of preserved soft tissue remains and  DNA from  woolly mammoths has led to the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Two methods have been proposed to achieve this. The first would be to use the cloning process, because even the most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough DNA intact to guide the production of an embryo.  [20]The second method  ...\n In March 2014, the  Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists reported that blood recovered from a frozen mammoth carcass in 2013 would now provide a good opportunity for cloning the woolly mammoth.  [21] Another way to create a living woolly mammoth would be to migrate genes from the mammoth genome into the genes of its closest living relative, the  Asian elephant, to create hybridized animals with the notable adaptations that it had for living  ...\n George Church has hypothesized the positive effects of bringing back the extinct woolly mammoth would have on the environment, such as the potential for reversing some of the damage caused by  global warming.  [26]He and his fellow researchers predict that mammoths would eat the dead grass allowing the sun to reach the spring grass; their weight would allow them to break through dense, insulating snow in order to let cold air reach the soil; and  ...\n  The  Pyrenean ibex was a subspecies of  Spanish ibex that roamed on the Iberian peninsula. While it was abundant up to the  Medieval times, over-hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries led to its demise. In 1999, only a single female named Celia was left alive in  Ordesa National Park. Scientists captured her, took a tissue sample from her ear, collared her, then released her back into the wild, where she lived until she was found dead in 2000, having  ...\n   The  aurochs was widespread across Eurasia, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent during the  Pleistocene, but only the European aurochs (  Bos primigenius primigenius) survived into historic times.  [30] This species is heavily featured in European cave paintings, such as  Lascaux and  Chauvet cave in France,  [31] and was still widespread during the  Roman era. Following the fall of the  Roman empire, overhunting of the aurochs by nobility caused  ...\n  The  quagga ( Equus quagga quagga) is a subspecies of the  plains zebra that was distinct in that it was striped on its face and upper torso, but its rear abdomen was a solid brown. It was native to  South Africa, but was wiped out in the wild due to overhunting for sport, and the last individual died in 1883 in the Amsterdam Zoo.  [38]However, since it is technically the same species as the surviving plains zebra, it has been argued that the quagga  ...\n   The  thylacine was native to the  Australian mainland,  Tasmania and  New Guinea. It is believed to have become  extinct in the 20th century. The thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the  Australian mainland before  British settlement of the continent. The last known thylacine, named Benjamin, died at the  Hobart Zoo, on September 7, 1936. It is believed to have died as the result of neglect \u2014locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters,  ...\n In December 2017 it was announced in  Nature Ecology and Evolution that the full nuclear genome of the thylacine had been successfully sequenced, marking the completion of the critical first step toward de-extinction that began in 2008, with the extraction of the DNA samples from the preserved pouch specimen.  [43] The Thylacine genome was reconstructed by using the genome editing method. The  Tasmanian devilwas used as a reference for the  ...\n   The  passenger pigeonnumbered in the billions before being wiped out due to commercial hunting and habitat loss. The non-profit Revive &amp; Restore obtained DNA from the passenger pigeon from museum specimens and skins; however, this DNA is degraded because it is so old. For this reason, simple cloning would not be an effective way to perform de-extinction for this species because parts of the genome would be missing. Instead, Revive &amp;  ...\n   Moa \u2013 this group of large (up to 4\u00a0m\u00a0[12\u00a0ft] tall and 110\u00a0kg\u00a0[250\u00a0lb]), flightless birds became extinct in approximately 1400 AD following the arrival and proliferation of the  Maori people on New Zealand; however, intact DNA from both preserved specimens and eggshells makes the moa a candidate for resurrection.  [46] [   failed verification] New Zealand politician  Trevor Mallard has suggested bringing back a medium-sized species.  [47]\n Heath hen \u2013 this subspecies of the  prairie chicken became extinct on  Martha&#39;s Vineyard in 1932 despite conservation efforts; however, the availability of usable DNA in museum specimens and protected areas in its former range makes this bird a possible candidate for de-extinction and reintroduction to its former habitat.  [48]\n Dodo \u2013 this large, flightless ground bird endemic to  Mauritius became extinct in the 1640s, less than a century after it was discovered, due to exploitation by humans and due to  introduced speciessuch as rats and pigs, which ate their eggs, and has since become a symbol of extinction in popular culture. Due to a wealth of bones and some tissues, it is possible that this species may live again as it has a close relative in the surviving  ...\n Elephant bird \u2013 of the largest birds to have ever existed, the elephant bird was driven to extinction by the early colonization of Madagascar. Ancient DNA has been obtained from the eggshells but may be too degraded for use in de-extinction.  [51]\n  Cave lion \u2013 The discovery of two preserved cubs in the  Sakha Republic ignited a project to clone the animal.  [52]\n Steppe bison \u2013 The discovery of the mummified steppe bison of 9,000 years ago could help people clone the ancient bison species back, even though the steppe bison would not be the first to be &#34;resurrected&#34;.  [53]\n Tarpan \u2013 A subspecies of wild horse that went extinct in 1909. Much like the aurochs, there have been many attempts to breed tarpan-like horses, the first being by the Heck brothers, creating the  Heck horse as a result. Though it is not a genetic copy, it is claimed to bear many similarities to the tarpan.  [54]Other attempts were made to create tarpan-like horses. A breeder named Harry Hegardt was able to breed a line of horses from  ...\n  Macrauchenia \u2013 The DNA of  Macrauchenia, which has been discovered in 2017, makes it possible for  Macrauchenia to be cloned.  [56]\n  Floreana Island tortoise \u2013 In 2008, mitochondrial DNA from the Floreana tortoise species was found in museum specimens. In theory, a breeding programme could be established to &#34;resurrect&#34; a pure Floreana species from living hybrids.  [57]  [58]\n  Gastric-brooding frog \u2013 In 2013, scientists in Australia successfully created a living embryo from non-living preserved genetic material, and hopes by using somatic-cell nuclear transfer methods, they can produce an embryo that can survive to the tadpole stage.

"note_en": "Microsoft has detailed one more area where it&#39;s engineers are using the Mozilla-created Rust programming language, a new project from a team at Azure to test WebAssembly modules in Kubernetes.\n Microsoft is already experimenting with Rust to  rewrite low-level components of Windows originally written in C and C++, and is also looking to Rust&#39;s memory-safety features to create a new language  for &#39;safe infrastructure programming&#39; under Project Verona.\n    DeisLabs, an Azure incubator for creating Kubernetes tools, has also used Rust to build  Krustlet, a &#39;kubelet&#39; than lets developers run multiple WebAssembly modules (Wasm) in Kubernetes, the dominant open-source tool for managing Docker containers.\n     &#34;While there have been many stories about using Rust for systems-level programming, you don&#39;t often hear stories about cloud software  or Kubernetes software being written in Rust. So, we wanted to explain why we made the choice we did,&#34;  writes Taylor Thomas, a senior software engineer at DeisLabs, Azure.\n The Krustlet project, which  emerged earlier this month, is &#34;highly experimental&#34;, with DeisLabs warning that &#34;you should use it in production at your own risk&#34;.\n   WebAssembly, an open standard supported by all major browsers, has primarily been used for creating powerful web applications that run in the browser. The main reason DeisLabs chose Rust for Krustlet is because Rust has native build support for compiled Wasm binaries or modules.\n But Microsoft is forging ahead with Rust-based Krustlet to help developers push WebAssembly code outside the browser, in support of  Mozilla&#39;s release last year of the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI), so that compilers can target a single interface rather than multiple operating systems.\n Developers can use Krustlet to test-drive WebAssembly modules in Kubernetes alongside containers within &#34;constrained and security-conscious environments&#34; where containers typically are challenged.\n DeisLabs developers also chose Rust because of its &#34;strong safety and security guarantees&#34;. Despite early troubles with Rust that put a drag on productivity they realized they could save time downstream by not exposing null pointers, thread safety issues, and other bugs. And they argue they were able to significantly reduce the efficiency gap between programming in Rust compared with Go.\n &#34;For the first week or so, we lost much of our time to learning how  borrows worked. After about two weeks, we were back up to 50% efficiency compared to us writing in Go. After a month, we all were comfortable enough that we were back up to full efficiency (in terms of how much code we could write),&#34; writes Thomas.\n &#34;However, we noticed that we gained productivity in the sense that we didn&#39;t spend as much time manually checking specific conditions, like null pointers, or not having to debug as many problems.&#34;\n On the issue of security versus missing features in Rust, Thomas highlights a recently discovered race condition in Helm, which was written in Go and was not picked up by the race checker for Go. But, he says, the bug would definitely have been caught by the Rust compiler.\n &#34;Even though we sometimes miss having a garbage collector so we don&#39;t have to worry about cloning, borrowing, ownership, etc., the pain we have avoided because of the Rust compiler&#39;s strict rules is incalculable,&#34; said Thomas.\n &#34;For comparison, last week\u00a0 we caught a significant race condition\u00a0in another Kubernetes-related project we maintain called\u00a0 Helm\u00a0(written in Go) that has been there for a year or more, and which passed the race checker for Go. That error would never have escaped the Rust compiler, preventing the bug from ever existing in the first place.&#34;\n Ralph Squillace, a principal program manager on Azure application platform upstream, said: &#34;Using Rust to build Kubernetes components was a wonderful experience compared to Go, and it should be much more widely adopted for Kubernetes work.&#34;\n  But Thomas said Rust still had obvious problems, including the length of time required to learn it.\n &#34;One of the biggest ones to point out is that async runtimes are still a bit unclear,&#34; noted Thomas. He also said the learning curve was difficult, which chimes with top obstacles to Rust adoption  revealed in Rustlang&#39;s most recent survey of developers.\n &#34;It takes several weeks of hard effort learning how to code properly in Rust before the learning curve levels out. However, that hard effort up front pays off in dividends due to the aforementioned safety features,&#34; said Thomas.\n &#34;We also noticed that once developers are over that initial curve, they are able to contribute to code just as easily as with any other language. Just be aware that there will be some initial pain.&#34;\n Nonetheless, Microsoft&#39;s Azure engineers intend to continue using Rust for projects where it&#39;s a good fit and &#34;highly recommend&#34; it for upcoming cloud projects.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:48:38", "tags": "rust,\u7a0b\u5e8f,\u7f16\u7a0b,app,programming language", "title":

"note_en": "Jitsi is an open source app for videoconferencing and chat. Works with Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and Android clients.\n Droplets created by using this image allow videoconference between Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS users, just requiring to open a new browser tab on laptops/desktops or to install the Jitsi app from the Play Store/App Store on mobile.\n This is a pre-configured image with pre-configured Jitsi and NGINX. Ypu&#39;ll only need a domain and we provide scripts for an effortless setup with HTTPS for secure communication for your team.\n It is recommended to run this image on a  CPU-Optimized droplet with at least 4GB of RAM or higher.\n   Before accessing the fresh droplet, add a domain to your project. This is required because most browsers require HTTPS in order to allow you to use the camera and microphone in a website, and it&#39;s not possible to enable HTTPS just with an IP.\n  It is mandatory to add an A record (i.e. jitsi-example.digitalocean.com) pointing to the IP associated with your droplet.\n  Access the console (i.e via ssh by running  ssh root@123.456.789) and set a new password.\n  We have created scripts to configure Jitsi in a very straightforward way. This is divided in two steps:\n     The menu will ask you to type the domain you added to your project in step 2. Type it exactly the same (i.e. jitsi-example.digitalocean.com), if you insert the droplet IP you  won&#39;t be able to configure HTTPS in the next step.\n Then select the option to generate a self-signed certificate, unless you want import your own certificate.\n    The menu will ask you for an email, it will be used to notify you when it&#39;s time to renew the certificates and maintain your website with a secure connection.\n Here&#39;s an excellent guide if you have questions with respect to HTTPS and encryption:  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04\n  Connect to the host via the hostname you set up in the earlier. Just open a browser tab and visit  jitsi-example.digitalocean.com (i.e. the domain that you previously configured).\n  (Optional) Use SSH keys instead of typed passwords to enter your server via SSH. See the details here:  https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/\n (Optional) Configure an application such as Google Authenticator to provide a dynamic additional password for SSH access. See the details here:  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-protect-ssh-with-two-factor-authentication\n  In addition to creating a Droplet from the Jitsi Server 1-Click App via the control panel, you can also use the   DigitalOcean API.\n As an example, to create a 4GB Jitsi Server Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following curl command. You\u2019ll need to either save your   API access token to an environment variable or substitute it into the command below.\n curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; \\ -H &#39;Authorization: Bearer &#39;$TOKEN&#39;&#39; -d \\ &#39;{&#34;name&#34;:&#34;choose_a_name&#34;,&#34;region&#34;:&#34;sfo2&#34;,&#34;size&#34;:&#34;s-2vcpu-4gb&#34;,&#34;image&#34;:&#34;opentradestatist-jitsiserver-18-04&#34;}&#39; \\ &#34;https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:48:30", "tags": "server,ssh,https", "title": "\u53ea\u9700\u4e00\u952e\u5373\u53ef\u5728DigitalOcean\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72JITSI Server Drop", "title_en": "Jitsi Server droplet on DigitalOcean in one click", "transed": 0, "url": "https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/jitsi-server", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["server", "ssh", "https"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000074, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u8981\u5ba3\u5e03QEMU 5.0.0\u7248\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u6765\u81ea232\u4e2a\u4f5c\u8005\u76842800\u591a\u4e2a\u63d0\u4ea4\u3002\n\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e0b\u8f7d\u9875\u9762\u83b7\u53d6tarball\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u66f4\u6539\u5217\u8868\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728Wiki\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u3002\nblock\uff1aqemu-img\uff1a\u2018Measure\u2019\u547d\u4ee4\u73b0\u5728\u652f\u6301Luks\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u2018Convert\u2019\u547d\u4ee4\u73b0\u5728\u652f\u6301\u8df3\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6e05\u96f6\u3002\n\u5757\uff1a\u5bf9qemu-storage-daemon\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u542f\u52a8\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u865a\u62df\u673a\u5373\u53ef\u8bbf\u95eeQEMU\u5757\u5c42/QMP\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u5757\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6216\u5185\u7f6eNBD\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002\nPowerPC\uff1a\u5f53ic-mode=DUAL\u65f6\uff0c\u2018pSeries\u2019\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0d\u518d\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u6765\u5728XIVE/XICS\u4e2d\u65ad\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u5546\u3002\nPowerPC\uff1a\u201cpowernv\u201d\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728TCG\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u6a21\u62dfKVM\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u4ee5\u8fd0\u884cKVM\u6765\u5bbe\u3002\nRISC-V\uff1a\u2018Virt\u2019\u548c\u2018siFive_u\u2019\u4e3b\u677f\u73b0\u5728\u652f\u6301Linux\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528syscon\u9a71\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u7535\u6e90/\u91cd\u542f", "note_en": "We\u2019d like to announce the availability of the QEMU 5.0.0 release.This release contains 2800+ commits from 232 authors.\n You can grab the tarball from our  download page.The full list of changes are available in the Wiki.\n  block: qemu-img: \u2018measure\u2019 command now supports LUKS images, \u2018convert\u2019command now supports skipping zero\u2019ing of target image\n  block: experimental support for qemu-storage-daemon, which provides accessto QEMU block-layer/QMP features like blocks jobs or built-in NBD serverwithout starting a full VM\n              PowerPC: \u2018pseries\u2019 machine no longer requires reboot to negotiate betweenXIVE/XICS interrupt controllers when ic-mode=dual\n  PowerPC: \u2018powernv\u2019 machine can now emulate KVM hardware acceleration to runKVM guests while in TCG mode\n    RISC-V: \u2018virt\u2019 and \u2018sifive_u\u2019 boards now support generic syscon drivers inLinux to control power/reboot", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:48:26", "tags": "\u53d1\u5e03,qemu", "title": "QEMU\u7248\u672c5.0.0\u53d1\u5e03", "title_en": "QEMU Version 5.0.0 Released", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.qemu.org/2020/04/29/qemu-5-0-0/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u53d1\u5e03", "qemu"]}]
