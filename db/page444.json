"note_en": "Google Cloud  Data Catalog is a fully managed and scalable metadata management service. It can help your organization quickly discover, understand, and manage all your data from one simple interface. Accessible from within the  Google Cloud console, Data Catalog allows immediate access to data discovery without requiring any upfront setup.\n The Data Catalog service is now generally available, providing regionalized service in 23 different regions globally. In addition to providing higher resilience against potential outages, the regionalized service delivers metadata residency at rest in each of the supported regions while providing a unified view of all data assets distributed across multiple regions.\n Most organizations today are dealing with a large and growing number of data assets, and want to open up access to that data so business users can find the right data assets through self-service. Past approaches have failed to scale up, required tedious set up, and did not deliver easy data discovery for all.\n At Google, we also faced this challenge for large and growing data assets, and built an internal data catalog service to help bring comprehensive metadata management to all data users. You can see more about the techniques used to build an effective data catalog in  Goods: Organizing Google\u2019s Datasets. Data Catalog builds on that foundation, bringing a scalable managed service to all Google Cloud users for data within BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Storage. Here are some details on how Data Catalog  ...\n Auto-syncing technical metadata Technical metadata for all  Google BigQuery data assets like datasets, tables, and views is synced into Data Catalog on a continuous basis. This means you can start using Data Catalog instantly and don\u2019t need to deal with any tedious setup. Data Catalog also auto-syncs technical metadata from  Pub/Sub and user-created filesets from  Cloud Storage. These filesets are simple to create \u2014you just need to specify a pattern with wildcards and apply it to a bucket. A fileset  ...\n  Technical metadata vs. business metadata Technical metadata refers to metadata that is available in the source system. Technical metadata for a BigQuery table includes table name, table description, column names, column types, column descriptions, creation date, last modification date, and more. For Pub/Sub, technical metadata refers to Pub/Sub topic names and date created. For Cloud Storage filesets, technical metadata refers to the fileset name, the pattern used for creating the fileset, creation  ...\n Business metadata refers to the collection of metadata that is critical for business and operational purposes but is not available in technical metadata. Business metadata might include the person responsible for a particular data asset, whether the data asset contains personally identifiable information (PII), if the data is approved for official use, the data retention policy for the data asset, the life cycle stage of the data asset, the data quality score, any known data quality issues, or  ...\n Data discovery Data Catalog can be used from a Google Cloud project by simply enabling it in that project. Data Catalog discovers data assets that are located not only in the project where the API is enabled but across all projects and across all regions. Support for data assets outside of BigQuery, Pub/Sub and Cloud Storage are in the Data Catalog roadmap, while support for non-Google Cloud data sources are available through open-source connectors (see below).\n You can use Data Catalog to search for all your data assets by simply typing a keyword and discovering all matching data assets. You can also narrow down your search to locate data assets in specific projects, systems, types of data assets, or data assets created during specific time periods.\n  Structured tags for business metadata At Google, we believe that simple string tags, once used widely, are no longer sufficient to capture the richness of business metadata. With Data Catalog, you can create tags with structure such that each tag contains multiple attributes, and each attribute is of one of the types  string, double, boolean, enumerated, and  datetime. Creating structured tags is a two-step process. First, define the structure of your tag in a tag template, then create tags with  ...\n As illustrated below, the structured tags on data assets provide rich business metadata to all data users. You as a data analyst or a data scientist can search for specific tags and better understand your data assets with the business context provided by the collection of tags. You as a data curator or a data governor can better manage data assets by using the metadata on data quality and data governance.\n  Access control for metadata Data Catalog is integrated with Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM). All operations, including search for data discovery, are serviced in accordance with the applicable access control specifications. If user A has read access to a data asset and user B does not have any access to that data asset, a search carried out by user A reveals the data asset, while the same search carried out by user B does not return the data asset.\n Metadata can be sensitive in nature and data governance teams might want certain business metadata tags to be visible only to select groups of users. Data Catalog provides access control on templates, and the access control extends to all tags created using that template.\n Auto-tagging PII data with Cloud DLP Data Catalog\u2019s integration with Cloud Data Loss Prevention (Cloud DLP) enables users to run Cloud DLP inspection jobs on BigQuery and  automatically create Data Catalog tags for identifying PII data. You can find this in the Cloud DLP interface. You can also refer to the Google tutorial  Create Data Catalog tags by inspecting BigQuery data with Cloud Data Loss Prevention and use the accompanying  source code.\n  Data Catalog support for non-Google Cloud data assets The Data Catalog API supports ingestion of technical metadata from non-Google Cloud data assets as well. The open-source connectors are organized in four Google Cloud Github repositories:  datacatalog-connectors contains the common components for all connectors;  datacatalog-connectors-rdbms has connectors for Oracle, SQL Server, Teradata, Redshift, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Vertica, and Greenplum;  datacatalog-connectors-bihosts connectors for Looker  ...\n  You can attach structured metadata tags on the Data Catalog entries for data assets that reside outside of Google Cloud. The single interface of Data Catalog lets you discover, annotate, and manage all your data assets.\n Next steps with Data Catalog\u00a0 Data Catalog is now GA and provides self-service data discovery at scale to enterprise users across all regions. Getting started with Data Catalog couldn\u2019t be easier, as it does not require any setup to quickly discover, understand, and manage all your data in Google Cloud and supports ingesting on-premises metadata from non-Google Cloud data sources.

And it needs to be secure. While AWS could have gone with existing technology, to satisfy both these main requirements, they went with building something new, Firecracker, that is both really fast \u2013it can boot Linux and start executing user space processes in 125ms \u2013and secure \u2013it uses hardware virtualization and more to isolate one Lambda environment from the other. In this article, we \u2019ll take a deep dive and look at how  ...\n   While it certainly is fun to read a lot of source code and figuring out what is going on under the hood, it is not as much fun as firing up your favorite editor and whipping up a lightweight virtual machine environment under Linux. With  Sparkler, will build a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that manages a virtual machine while providing a certain environment to the virtual machine, which it runs. We will also write a tiny \u201coperating system \u201dwhich will run inside the virtual machine. The VMM emulates  ...\n If you are interested in understanding how KVM works while getting your hands dirty with example code, I recommend you read this  article on Sparkler.\n  Running unmodified operating systems, especially ones for which source code isn \u2019t available means that the virtual machine has to very closely resemble a real PC. QEMU or Virtual Box do use KVM to speed up guests as much as possible, but they also emulate a real PC with BIOS routines, various legacy and peripheral devices like graphics, sound and storage cards. This is why is is easy to run off-the-shelf versions of MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows or binary Linux distributions like Fedora or Ubuntu  ...\n But, as for these legacy and other devices, KVM directly has very limited support for these. Also, when operating system boot, the boot loader usually depends on BIOS routines to deal with hardware like the screen, keyboard and disks. QEMU uses  SeaBIOS as its choice of BIOS firmware, for example and it ships with it. Without BIOS routines being present, it wouldn\u2019t be a real PC and this will stop it from running off-the-shelf operating systems.\n The most important takeaways are that there is a lot of legacy code like the BIOS and emulation of full-blown peripherals, which is relatively very slow in virtualization systems that are designed to emulate a PC as closely as possible.\n  When a PC starts, the CPU is in real mode or 16-bit mode. The BIOS runs the power-on self-test or POST, reads in the boot loader from the designated boot device to a set location in RAM and passes control over to it. The boot loader usually uses BIOS routines to display text, read disks, get system information etc.\n It turns out that the Linux kernel does not need BIOS routines at all. It is the boot loader that does. Linux has what is know as a \u201cboot protocol\u201d, which tells the boot loader or any other program present at boot time, how to lay out the kernel and supporting data structures in RAM and how to pass control to the kernel. For the x86 architecture,  boot protocols are available for real mode, 32-bit and 64-bit modes.\n So, just like how we loaded the monitor program binary into the allocated guest memory, Firecracker loads the Linux kernel, setting up the required data structures like initial stack, command line parameters, as per the Linux kernel boot protocol. See the following files from the Firecracker Git repo:\n  This does away with the need for having any BIOS routines loaded during the boot process. This simplifies the design of the virtual machine by removing all the complexity required to enable a boot loader or having a need for BIOS routines at all.\n In the tiny Sparkler monitor program, there is no use of any BIOS routines as well. Also, because there is no BIOS at all. The  print_str routine for example, uses the  OUT x86 instruction to output characters, which causes a VM exit. These exits are handled by the  sparkler program, which uses the  putc()library function to display the character on to the terminal. Something very similar happens in Firecracker as well. A virtual serial console is setup for the Linux kernel via memory-mapped  ...\n  The other clever thing about Firecracker is that the virtual machine in which it runs the Linux kernel has very few devices. Linux, on x86 assumes the presence of an interrupt controller and an interval timer. These are really fundamental since the CPU doesn \u2019t have these built in. While it is possible to emulate these devices in the VMM, KVM provides a way better alternative. It is able to emulate them in-kernel for you. This is a big deal. Remember that as long as there is not VM  ...\n   If you look at the source code of the PS/2 keyboard controller emulated by Firecracker, you\u2019ll notice that it is really sparse and it implements only one main function  trigger_ctrl_alt_del(), which is pretty self-explanatory.\n  VirtIO needs a bit more explanation. Real hardware devices have all kinds of quirks and are fairly complicated to program. When you have operating systems that can \u2019t be modified, but come with drivers for some hardware devices, it makes sense to emulate them. That way, it becomes possible to run these operating systems unmodified. But with Linux \u2019s rich history of virtualization, there are more high-performance solutions available. Modern Linux kernels ship with drivers for a virtual  ...\n VirtIO was developed initially by Rusty Russell for  LGuest, which made its way into the kernel in 2007, but was removed in 2017. VirtIO however, continues to thrive. VirtIO now has a  specificationand device drivers are available in-tree in the Linux kernel. The concept behind VirtIO is very simple. It specifies a way for the guest and host to communicate efficiently. It defines various device types like: network, block, console, entropy, memory balloon and SCSI host. It supports  ...\n Since the Linux kernel also ships with device drivers for VirtIO devices, all the host needs to do is to emulate the specially-designed-for-virtualization VirtIO devices and have Linux work seamlessly with them, with much better performance compared to emulating some other real hardware device Linux also supports.\n There is another very powerful feature of the Linux kernel called vhost. These are basically VirtIO devices emulated in the kernel directly, which means that there is no need to context switch to the VMM to deal with I/O from VirtIO devices. At the time of this writing however, Firecracker emulates both the network and the block VirtIO devices in the VMM and does not depend on vhost for further acceleration.\n At the time of this writing, Linux kernel 5.4 hasn\u2019t yet been released, but there is a  patch that implements virtio-fs, which allows efficient sharing of files and directories between hosts and guest. This way, a directory containing the guests\u2019 file system can be on the host, much like how Docker works.\n  For a use case like AWS Lambda, it might not be a such good idea to just run processes (inside which Lambda functions run) belonging to different accounts on the same physical or virtual server. It would be a security nightmare. You can \u2019t blame an architect however, if she chose to run processes from different accounts inside of Linux containers (using something like Docker). The only thing is we don \u2019t really know what holes exist yet, letting processes break their container  ...\n With containers being the main unit of abstraction, one common worry about Kubernetes security is the Linux API\u2019s attack surface. Well, there has been improvement in this direction with projects like  Kata Containers, which run micro-VMs that use hardware virtualization for the containers, while providing a Kubernetes compatible interface so that Kubernetes can be used to orchestrate these containers. Similar to Firecracker, Intel started a project,  NEMU, which is QEMU cleaned  ...\n From the interface perspective, another important point to consider is the minimal set of devices supported by Firecracker. This further reduces the available attack surface.\n  Firecracker goes much further than just resting on security that hardware-based virtualization buys. There are two primary mechanisms used to secure the Firecracker process further. First, it can be deployed via a  jailor utility, which uses  chroot() and  cgroups to restrict the Firecracker process. Furthermore, it also  uses seccomprules to limit what the Firecracker process can do on the host system. Rules are setup carefully to only allow system calls that Firecracker explicitly  ...\n  Firecracker is a VM environment specially built to run only the Linux kernel, doing away with legacy BIOS or devices, while leveraging modern, virtualization techniques like VirtIO and securing the Firecracker process with  chroot(),  cgroupsand seccomp rules. On one side we have the most generic virtualization systems like QEMU and Virtual Box which can run pretty much any OS targeted at PCs, whereas on the other side, we have systems like Firecracker that are specialized  ...\n We also went into great detail of how KVM works by building a virtual machine monitor (VMM) in C. This is the piece that interfaces with KVM to create a hardware based virtual machine in which we ran a small program written in assembly language which talks to the VMM using devices that the VMM emulates. While there is a simple \u201cconsole \u201ddevice that lets the VM input and output text, there are other more complex devices that can read a tweet, get the weather and air quality  ...",

"note_en": "A private equity firm will not gain control of dot-org, the digital real estate that is home to millions of nonprofits, nongovernmental organizations and community groups.\n The board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees the internet naming system, decided on Thursday night to veto the sale of the rights to dot-org to Ethos Capital, which had offered more than $1 billion.\n Maarten Botterman, the chair of ICANN, wrote in  a blog post that after all the considerations were weighed, rejecting Ethos\u2019s proposed bid was \u201creasonable, and the right thing to do.\u201d\n Ever since the planned sale was announced in November, the deal had stirred  fierce opposition. Dot-org is best known as the cyber neighborhood to nonprofit organizations with civic missions like the Red Cross (redcross.org), Human Rights Watch (hrw.org) and NPR (npr.org).\n To many, handing control of dot-org to a private equity firm seemed almost like heresy. The growing ranks of opponents eventually included internet pioneers, nonprofit leaders and the attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra.\n  The opponents raised several concerns, including the risk of steep price increases, underinvestment and censorship. Ethos Capital tried  to address those worries by pledging to set up a \u201cstewardship council\u201d of outside experts and making \u201cpublic interest commitments\u201d to restrain price increases and not censor web content.\n But critics remained unconvinced. They did not believe that a private-equity firm, driven by the need to deliver rich returns for investors, would act in the best interests of what they regard as the domain of online civic society.\n In an interview on Friday, Mr. Botterman said a \u201cconvincing majority\u201d of the 15 voting members of the board opposed the Ethos Capital bid. The overarching concern, he said, was the apparent \u201clack of guarantees that the spirit that was always intended for dot-org\u201d would be preserved if the private equity firm gained control.\n ICANN\u2019s ruling on Thursday and the current arrangements for managing dot-org are byproducts of the arcane governance and history of the internet naming system.\n In 2002, ICANN granted the Public Interest Registry, another nonprofit, the right to run the dot-org domain. Part of the rationale was that the domain should not be managed on a purely commercial basis \u2014 unlike dot-com and dot-net, for example.\n The Public Interest Registry, in turn, is controlled by the Internet Society, a nonprofit that helps develop internet standards, education programs and policy. The registry holds a contract to manage dot-org, which was renewed last year for 10 more years.\n But under the rules governing the registry, ICANN must approve major changes in its practices and ownership.\n The Internet Society saw the sale to Ethos Capital as a way to gain an endowment to fund its operations and get out of the business of operating dot-org, which it wanted to do for some time.\n In an interview this week, Andrew Sullivan, chief executive of the Internet Society, said the Ethos Capital bid was one of several proposals it had received \u2014 and one that appeared to combine people who had internet experience with the financial resources to help dot-org grow and prosper.\n \u201cWe viewed it as a good transaction and that would be good for everyone,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.\n If ICANN rejected the Ethos Capital deal, the Internet Society had no immediate backup plan, Mr. Sullivan said, adding that dot-org would be run as before. \u201cWe will not neglect dot-org,\u201d he said.\n The opposition to the Ethos Capital bid took a number of forms, including  an alterative proposal made in Januaryby a group of internet veterans and nonprofit leaders called the Cooperative Corporation of .ORG Registrants. Among the cooperative \u2019s initial seven directors are Esther Dyson, who was the first chair of ICANN, and Mike Roberts, ICANN \u2019s first president. The Internet Society, Mr. Sullivan said in the interview this week, has not yet had talks with the cooperative \u2019s founders.  ...\n On April 14,  Ms. Dyson and Mr. Roberts wrote to Mr. Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general, urging him to oppose the private equity deal. ICANN is incorporated in California. (The letter was also addressed to the attorney general of Pennsylvania, where the Public Interest Registry is incorporated.)\n In January, Mr. Becerra had expressed concerns about the deal and requested documents. Then, in  a letter to ICANN\u2019s chief executive and board chair on April 15, Mr. Becerra sided with the deal\u2019s opponents and concluded that the dot-org domain and \u201cthe global internet community \u2014 of which innumerable Californians are a part \u2014 are better served if ICANN withholds approval of the proposed sale.\u201d\n The ICANN board came to the same conclusion, after lengthy deliberations and seeing the breadth and intensity of the opposition.\n \u201cThe idea of a private equity firm owning this crucial public asset on the web was just anathema to a lot of people,\u201d said Andrew Allemann, editor of Domain Name Wire, an industry news site.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:58:44", "tags": "equity,\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,internet", "title":

Coyle owns equity in Sports Texas Nutrition Training and Fitness, Inc., a company that sells the  inertial load ergometer used in this study. The results of this study do not constitute endorsement by the American College of Sports Medicine. The results are presented clearly, honestly, and without fabrication, falsification, or inappropriate data manipulation.\n   High postprandial plasma lipids (i.e.; triglycerides) (PPL) are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Physical inactivity, characterized by  prolonged sitting and a low step count elevates PPL and thus risk of disease.\n    This study determined if the interruption of  prolonged sitting (i.e.; 8-h of inactivity) with hourly cycling sprints of only 4-s duration each (i.e.; 4-s x 5 per h x 8-h = 160-s per day; SPRINTS) improves PPL. The 4-s sprints employed an  inertial load ergometer and were followed by 45-s of seated rest.\n    Four men and four women participated in two trials. Interventions consisted of an 8-h period of sitting (SIT), or a trial with equal sitting time interrupted with five SPRINTS every hour. The morning after the interventions, PPL and fat oxidation were measured over a 6-h period. Plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations were measured bihourly and incremental area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.\n    No differences (p&gt;0.05) between interventions were found for plasma insulin or glucose AUC. However, SPRINTS displayed a 31% (408\u00b1119 vs. 593\u00b188 mg/dL/6h; p=0.009) decrease in plasma triglyceride incremental AUC and a 43% increase in whole body fat oxidation (P=0.001) when compared to SIT.\n    These data indicate that hourly very short bouts (4 s) of maximal intensity cycle sprints interrupting  prolonged sittingcan significantly lower the next day \u2019s postprandial plasma triglyceride response and increase fat oxidation after a high fat meal in healthy young adults. Given that these improvements were elicited from only 160-s of non-fatiguing exercise per day, it raises the question as to what is the least amount of exercise that can acutely improve fat metabolism

I recently caught myself giving a variation of this answer every time I was asked how I was doing. \u201cSo much work, but hopefully it will be better next week.\u201d Being busy all the time can give us an  illusion of productivity which may feel reassuring, but isn\u2019t there a risk we are too busy to enjoy life?\n For some people, being busy is unfortunately not an option. Students working part-time to pay for their studies, parents with two jobs just to stay afloat\u2014not everyone has the luxury of managing their time the way they see fit. But many people do have this flexibility, and yet rush from one task to another without ever taking a step back to ask: am I  really enjoying any of this? Or are these tasks actually making me too busy to enjoy life?\n Research shows that humans tend to do whatever it takes to keep busy, even if the activity feels meaningless to them. Dr Bren\u00e9 Brown from the University of Houston describes being \u201ccrazy busy\u201d as a numbing strategy we use to avoid facing the truth of our lives.\n We are scared of idleness because stopping would mean having to really consider what we want out of life and what we currently have. Sometimes, the gap feels so wide, we\u2019d rather stay on the hamster wheel.\n Being busy is a defense mechanism. It\u2019s a way to avoid just  being. Having responsibilities, deadlines, a long task list\u2026 Overloading our senses can make us believe we are moving in the right direction, or at least in  a direction. But the constant cycle of tasks we tackle without ever thinking often leaves us stagnant. Who proudly looks back at their old to-do lists at the end of the year and thinks: \u201cWow, I tackled so many tasks this year\u201d?\n Instead of measuring progress by the quantity of work we produce, we should consider the quality of our work. Not just the quality of the output, as usually measured by externally-designed metrics, but the quality of the impact it has on our mental and physical well-being. \u201cDid the work feel intellectually stimulating, did I learn something new, did it help me cultivate my  curiosity, did it give me the opportunity to connect with interesting people? \u201dare sensible questions to ask when work represents  ...\n  \u201cYou cannot step into the same river twice, for other waters are continually flowing on,\u201d supposedly said Heraclitus. Time is like a river. If you\u2019re too busy to enjoy life\u2014too busy to spend time with friends and family, too busy to learn how to paint or play the guitar, too busy to go on that hike, too busy to cook something nice for yourself\u2014these moments will be gone, and you will never get that time back.\n You may think it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s not. Like many people, I personally experience  time anxiety\u2014the recurring thought that it\u2019s too late to start or accomplish something new\u2014but the reality is you probably still have many years in front of you. Defining what \u201ctime well spent\u201d means to you and making space for these moments is one of the greatest gifts you can make to your future self.\n Next time you think of  learning something new, or a friend asks you if you want to do something together or have a chat, and your automatic answer is: \u201cI\u2019m just too busy\u201d, take a few minutes to actually consider whether you are actually too busy, and, if that\u2019s the case, whether this busyness is more valuable to you in the long-term than learning something new or spending time with your friend.\n Maybe you are actually going through a temporary phase where you\u2019re working on an exciting but all-consuming project\u2014and that\u2019s fine. Such activities you feel extremely passionate about are actually nurturing. But if \u201cI\u2019m just too busy\u201d is becoming a recurrent answer of yours, you may want to consider whether it is possible to be  that excited over such a long period of time.\n Again, if that\u2019s the case, lucky you\u2014the problem is we usually don\u2019t even take the time to consider the alternative, which is that we\u2019re numbing our minds with work. Being busy with exciting work is good. Being too busy to enjoy life, spending time with the people you love, and exploring your full potential is not. If you belong to the people who do have a choice, consider making the most of your fortunate situation.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:58:34", "tags": "enjoy,\u65f6\u95f4", "title":

to use SteamVR by running Windows with virtualization software like Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion. Valve says legacy builds of the virtual reality platform will also remain accessible on the Mac by right-clicking on SteamVR in Steam and selecting Properties &gt; Betas.\n Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi announced that SteamVR was coming to the Mac at WWDC 2017, but a  recent Valve survey indicated that more than 95 percent of Steam users are running Windows or Linux.\n Multiple reports have indicated that Apple plans to release a  combination AR/VR headset by 2021 or 2022, followed by sleeker AR glasses by 2023.\n This is not surprising at all. Apple has not been friendly to developers who want to write cross-platform, enduring code, doing things like deprecating OpenGL and 32-bit support and just in general constantly making it difficult for people to keep old code working. Hell, the rumors of transitioning to ARM suggests this is going to get even worse.  Meanwhile Windows can still run binaries from 20 years ago without much issue. Windows is the gold standard for keeping code working for a long time, second  ...\n Not surprised, only a tiny fraction of Mac machines have the GPU required to use VR.  Also, given the fact that Mac user base is small compared to PCs... it&#39;s not worth while for Valve.  No serious gamer really uses a Mac for games, they use Windows PCs, and Consoles.\n It is only a question or market share, Macs can be great for gaming. OS is super stable, Metal is pretty fast. Toxic comment like yours are another reason.\nToxic? It&#39;s not toxic when it&#39;s a valid criticism. I want gaming on Mac to thrive. Apple has done little on their end to bring this to reality. MacOS may be ready for prime time, but lets be real the hardware side is very lacking to take advantage of that.\n They should have announced they were discontinuing support at the same time they were announcing support for it. Anyone who is involved with gaming at all knew any type of realistic VR solution on Mac was a pipe dream.  Apple is stubborn in their support for the standards needed for gaming. The big game devs aren&#39;t going to rewrite their entire graphics subsystems to Metal and all of the other Apple centric API&#39;s for some piece of a 5% market share (most of that 5% of Steam Mac users are  ...\n Remember, these toxic replies are just opinions, useless, irrelevant opinions. For the Apple haters this is just bias confirmation. We\u2019ve listened for decades to the cacophony of the haters and nothing they predicted has ever come to pass.\nI&#39;m not an Apple hater... Macs have been my daily driver since 2005... But for gaming, and especially VR? It&#39;s a dead end. That&#39;s what PCs are for. Yes, I can play Civ 6 on just about any Mac. That&#39;s great! But almost no Macs support the minimum specs for VR, and the ones that do are very expensive and have either no or very expensive GPU upgrade options, so they have a very short shelf life.\n  Apple last week launched its new 2020 iPhone SE, a low-cost $399 smartphone that features iPhone 8 components upgraded with the same A13 chip available in Apple&#39;s flagship iPhones.

"note_en": "I realized I was asking Google Assistant the same questions over and over again. Like  What\u2019s the current weather? or  What\u2019s on my calendar for today? So I set out to build a small dashboard for my Raspberry Pi that I could check instead.\n I bought a  Waveshare 2.7inch e-Paper HAT (B) for ~$20. This version comes with a printed circuit board that slots right onto the general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins of a Raspberry Pi. You can also use the included wires to avoid blocking the unused GPIO pins.\n  I followed the installation instructions from the  Waveshare wiki and fired up one of the hello world programs \u2014 there are  versions in C and Python. The steps to get this going, as well as the example programs, are quite accessible compared to other Raspberry Pi hardware accessories.\n  I started picking through the source code of the Python examples to understand how  epd-library works. The version  B of this screen is tri-colored, it can display white, black, and red, and the resolution is 264x176. The examples start by clearing the screen (filling it with white) and then create two layers which are  Image objects from the  Pillow library. One of the layers is the black content and the other layer is the red content. These are then passed to the render function  EPD::display.\n  # initialize the EPD classepd  = epd2in7b .EPD ( )epd .init ( ) # start with a clear (white) backgroundepd .Clear ( ) # define a simple fontfont24  = ImageFont .truetype (os .path .join (picdir ,  &#39;Font.ttc&#39; ) ,  24 ) # create empty image objects/layersHBlackimage  = Image .new ( &#39;1&#39; ,  (epd .height , epd .width ) ,  255 )HRedimage  = Image .new ( &#39;1&#39; ,  (epd .height , epd .width ) ,  255 ) # render the black sectionblack_draw  = ImageDraw .Draw (HBlackImage )black_draw .text ( ( 1 ,  1 ) , top_text , font =FONT_LARGER , fill = 0 ) # calculate  ...\n For the prototype, I\u2019ll show the current weather and some news headlines from the BBC.  Open Weather and  News API both have generous free-tiers. For each of these features, I\u2019ll write functions that return text which I can create layers from.\n I\u2019ll be using  formatted strings from Python 3.5 (as opposed to the superior  f-strings) because that\u2019s what  Raspian (the default Raspberry Pi operating system) comes with.\n  def  get_weather ( ) :  &#39;&#39;&#39; Get the formatted weather description. E.g. `Richmond, GB: Clear sky` &#39;&#39;&#39; owm  = pyowm .OWM (OPEN_WEATHER_KEY ) observation  = owm .weather_at_place (LOCATION ) w  = observation .get_weather ( ) detailed  = w .get_detailed_status ( ) .capitalize ( ) temp_data  = w .get_temperature ( &#39;celsius&#39; ) current_temp  =  str (temp_data [ &#34;temp&#34; ] ) min_temp  =  str (temp_data [ &#34;temp_min&#34; ] ) max_temp  =  str (temp_data [ &#34;temp_max&#34; ] ) text  =  &#39;{}: {}\\n{}\u00b0C ({}\u00b0C  ...\n News API sadly doesn\u2019t have an up-to-date library available so I use  requests to make an HTTP call and parse the data. I can display about three headlines (including an extra wrapped line for each). The text needs to be manually  wrapped to stop it going off-screen.\n def  get_news (limit = 3 ) :  &#39;&#39;&#39; Get some news headlines from the BBC formatted in a list. E.g. `- Acclaimed Swedish author Per Olov Enquist dies - PM&#39;s return to work &#39;a boost for the country&#39; - &#39;Myth that Sweden has not taken serious steps&#39;` &#39;&#39;&#39; url  =  &#39;https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=bbc-news&amp;apiKey={}&#39; . format (NEWS_API_KEY ) resp  = requests .get (url =url ) data  = resp .json ( ) articles  =  [article [ &#39;title&#39; ]  for article  indata  ...\n With these two sections of text, I create the image layers. I want the weather to be on the black-colored layer with a slightly larger font. The news will be underneath on the red-colored layer. Here\u2019s a function that takes an instance of the EPD class as well as two sections of text.\n def  show_text (epd , top_text = &#39;&#39; , bottom_text = &#39;&#39; ) :  &#39;&#39;&#39; Given an EPD instance, and sections of text, render the text. &#39;&#39;&#39; HBlackImage  = Image .new ( &#39;1&#39; ,  (epd2in7b .EPD_HEIGHT , epd2in7b .EPD_WIDTH ) ,  255 ) HRedImage  = Image .new ( &#39;1&#39; ,  (epd2in7b .EPD_HEIGHT , epd2in7b .EPD_WIDTH ) ,  255 )  # render the black section black_draw  = ImageDraw .Draw (HBlackImage ) black_draw .text ( ( 1 ,  1 ) , top_text , font =FONT_LARGER , fill = 0 )  # calculate the depth of the black  ...\n The two Image objects contain simple data and don\u2019t \u2018know\u2019 what color they are. They look like this when rendered to bitmap format.\n  Notice the space that the second layer leaves for the first layer so that the text doesn\u2019t overlap.\n  The main function of this program makes sure that we only display the dashboard during hours when someone will be awake. I want to avoid  ghosting which the documentation warns about. The EPD class that gets passed to the  show_text function is initialized here.\n def  main ( ) :  try : epd  = epd2in7b .EPD ( ) logging .info ( &#34;Init and Clear&#34; ) epd .init ( ) epd .Clear ( ) show_text (epd , top_text =get_weather ( ) , bottom_text =get_news ( ) )  # leave the dashboard up for half an hour time .sleep ( 60 * 30 ) logging .info ( &#34;Clear...&#34; ) epd .init ( ) epd .Clear ( )  except IOError  as e : logging .info (e ) sys .exit ( )  except KeyboardInterrupt : logging .info ( &#34;ctrl + c:&#34; ) epd2in7b .epdconfig .module_exit ( ) sys .exit ( ) while  True : t  = datetime .datetime .now ( )  # rest the screen  ...\n   I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll flesh this prototype out into an open source project so for now the full source code is in a  gist.\n  I didn\u2019t invest any time in working with the four buttons on the left of the screen (they\u2019re labelled KEY1, KEY2, etc. in the above picture) but I think it would be worthwhile to integrate them in a fleshed out dashboard \u2014 they connect as standard GPIO buttons.\n I\u2019ve learned that e-ink screens are worth the investment for me and I might look into getting a much larger version. The viewing angle is like that of a  Kindle and although it\u2019s small it\u2019s beautiful to look at and has a more \u2018real\u2019 feel than a laptop or smartwatch screen.\n I look forward to seeing this technology progress and the commercial applications that arise. I saw that Whole Foods Market were using them in-store back  in 2016. It would be nice to have less LEDs staring at me whenever I leave the house!", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:58:19", "tags": "\u7535\u5b50,ink,epd", "title":

"note_en": "Runa Sandvik works on digital security for journalists, founded upon her experiences working at The New York Times, the Freedom of the Press Foundation and The Tor Project.\n Online child exploitation is a horrific crime that requires an effective response. A  draft bill, first proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) in January, intends to provide exactly that. However, technology experts warn the bill not only fails to meet the challenge, it creates new problems of its own. My job is to enable journalists to do their work securely \u2014to communicate with others, research sensitive stories and publish hard-hitting news. This bill introduces significant harm to journalists  ...\n Under the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (or EARN IT) Act, a government commission would define  best practices for how technology companies should combat this type of material. On the surface, EARN IT proposes an impactful approach. A New York Times  investigationin September found that \u201cmany tech companies failed to adequately police sexual abuse imagery on their platforms. \u201dThe investigation highlighted features, offered by these companies, that provide  ...\n In reality, the criticized features are exactly the same ones that protect our privacy online. They help us read The Washington Post in private and ensure we only see authentic content created by the journalists. They allow us to communicate with each other. They empower us to express ourselves. And they enable us to connect with journalists so the truth can make the page. This raises the question of whether the bill will primarily protect children or primarily undermine free speech online.  ...\n It should be pointed out that EARN IT does not try to ban the use of these features. In fact, the bill does not specifically mention them at all. But if we look at how companies would apply the \u201cbest practices, \u201dit becomes clear that the government is intending to make these features difficult to provide, that the government is looking to discourage companies from offering \u2014and increasing the use of \u2014these features. By accepting EARN IT, we will give up our ability \u2014and our children \u2019s future  ...\n  Four of the \u201cbest practices\u201d relate to requiring companies to have the ability to \u201cidentify\u201d child sexual abuse material. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not possible to identify this material without also having the ability to identify any and all other types of material \u2014 like a journalist communicating with a source, an activist sharing a controversial opinion or a doctor trying to  raise the alarm about the coronavirus. Nothing prevents the government from later expanding the bill to cover other illegal  ...\n Our digital life is protected by the same features that allow some bad people to do bad things online. They protect us as we visit The Washington Post  website, use the  Signal app to contact one of its journalists or use the  Tor Browser to submit information to their  anonymous tip line. These features all enable privacy, a core component of the journalistic process. They enable journalists to pursue and tell the truth, without fear or favor. And not just in the U.S., but globally. We should  ...\n The same New York Times  investigationfound that law enforcement agencies devoted to fighting online child exploitation \u201cwere left understaffed and underfunded, even as they were asked to handle far larger caseloads. \u201dThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), established by Congress in 1984 to reduce child sexual exploitation and prevent child victimization, \u201cwas ill equipped for the expanding demands. \u201dIt \u2019s worth asking, then, why EARN IT does not instead empower  ...\n We must consider the possibility that this bill fails to achieve its stated goal. That it will not protect children online, and will introduce harm to their digital presence and ability to speak freely. Everyone deserves good security, and it \u2019s on us to find ways to prevent harm without compromising on our digital rights. To force companies to weaken our protection to give law enforcement greater insight would be the equivalent of forcing people to live without locks and curtains in their  ...\n That\u2019s not to say we have to accept no solution. But it can\u2019t be this one.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:58:15", "tags": "\u5a01\u80c1,threatens,\u8bb0\u8005,bill", "title":

"note_en": "You might want to make sure there\u2019s not a rat living (or recently dead) in your car\u2019s engine.\n Why are you still reading? Check your car for a rat, I said. That\u2019s the tip. Rats like it in there, and while they could take up residence in a car engine at any time, anecdotal reports (and mankind\u2019s modern if imperfect knowledge of rat behavior) suggest the phenomenon may be occurring more frequently right now.\n Three line breaks into this story, it is becoming increasingly clear that the depth of your interest in rats plunges far deeper than basic car maintenance tips. You are a person who seeks to understand rats in a way that rats may not even understand themselves. You want to read the invisible instruction encoded in a rat \u2019s brain that compels him to abandon the deli dumpster where he has spent the majority of his short life and, all of a sudden, carry a leaf and perhaps some twigs into the engine  ...\n  Tuesday was the first time in about a week that Kelsey Snell and her husband had attempted to drive their car. A clue that something was amiss came from the vehicle\u2019s internal alert system.\n \u201cIt gave us a really weird error message as we were driving away,\u201d said Ms. Snell, 36, a congressional correspondent for NPR who lives in Washington.\n \u201cI\u2019ve never seen rats in our driveway before,\u201d said Ms. Snell, \u201cand then we started driving a little bit further and the error message\u201d \u2014 an alert about the car\u2019s exhaust system \u2014 \u201cgot a little more insistent.\u201d\n Ms. Snell and her husband abandoned their errand (a birthday flower delivery). Back in their driveway, they popped the hood, revealing, she said, \u201cpoop all over the engine,\u201d as well as \u201ca puddle of rat urine,\u201d leaves, sticks and small bones.\n \u201c WE HAVE RATS LIVING IN THE ENGINE,\u201d Ms. Snell wrote in a cautionary tweet about the incident. \u201cThe dealership said we are the FIFTH people to call this week with this problem.\u201d\n Ms. Snell, who has never previously shared her car with a rat, confirmed by phone that an employee at her local service center told her that such incidents have become \u201call of a sudden super common\u201d within \u201cthe past two or three weeks.\u201d\n  Her bill for the replacement of chewed-through wires was around $400. It\u2019s not uncommon for such repair costs to run into the thousands.\n Michael H. Parsons, a visiting research scholar at Fordham University who studies the city rats of New York, said that car engines evoked rats\u2019 ancestral homes: dark, warm burrows with easy access to chewable roots. (The common brown rat appears to have arrived in North America around 1775, perhaps when European ships docked at Manhattan\u2019s South Street Seaport; the species is believed to have originated in Asia.)\n To rats, said Dr. Parsons, state of the art vehicular wiring systems are \u201csurrogate roots.\u201d Not because they provide the moisture or nutrient access of real roots, but because they somewhat resemble them and are chewable.\n Rats \u201cget a certain amount of comfort by just chewing,\u201d said Michael Deutsch, an urban entomologist and the technical director of the Arrow Exterminating Company, headquartered on Long Island.\n In fact, the word \u201crodent\u201d comes from the same Latin root as \u201cerode\u201d \u2014 rodere , meaning \u201cto gnaw.\u201d Rats must gnaw, and constantly, because their sharp, hard incisors grow continuously throughout their lives \u2014 around four or five inches a year.\n \u201cIf they don\u2019t keep them trimmed,\u201d said Mr. Deutsch, \u201cthey might not be able to open or close their jaw. In some extreme cases, their bottom incisors have grown up into the upper roof of their mouth. And, of course, they died.\u201d\n Because of their impulse to chew, rats frequently destroy material that offers no nutritional value to them. The inherent appeal of car wiring, Dr. Parsons said, is complemented by the fact that, in recent years, many car manufacturers have switched from petroleum-based wire insulation to greener, less expensive soy-based kind.\n While rat infestations in car engines are not rare occurrences, researchers are attempting to determine whether they are increasing in areas where rats \u2019usual food and harborage sites have been disrupted by pandemic distancing efforts. A restaurant that is no longer serving food to humans is also no longer producing large quantities of human food garbage \u2014sustenance for city rats. (Rural rat populations, which are less likely to rely on commercial food waste, may not be experiencing  ...\n \u201cMovement distances and patterns are really tightly linked to the availability of resources like food, places to burrow and mates,\u201d said Kaylee Byers, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of British Columbia who works with the Vancouver Rat Project, an urban research initiative. \u201cWith fewer resources, rats will move further than they would normally or may migrate from places that previously had food to areas where food is more plentiful.\u201d\n Dr. Parsons said that while usual rat migration is primarily limited to omega males (the lowest rung of the rat social order, ranked below alpha and beta male rats), it now \u201cappears that all affected rats are migrating\u201d \u2014 a circumstance that \u201cgreatly increases competition, and stress, and presumably causes rats to be more aggressive and visible during daylight hours.\u201d\n The bad news, then, is that an increased number of rats may be looking for food in your vicinity, and these rats may be more stressed, desperate and aggressive than usual. The good news is that at least some of them may have a certain \u00e9lan, relative to other rats.\n Dr. Parsons is working on a study that draws on accounts from other researchers and pest control experts in North America, Europe and Asia that detail how rats \u201care migrating en masse from closed restaurants, delis and arenas\u201d to new environments. An alternative pandemic hypothesis, he said, is that \u201cnothing is happening, and people are just noticing rats more,\u201d perhaps because they are spending more time than usual walking around their neighborhoods, or exercising outdoors.\n You might decrease the odds of harboring rats in your car, Dr. Parsons said, by avoiding parking over sewers and drainage catch basins \u201cas rats utilize these to move above and below ground.\u201d He also recommended starting your car and moving it from time to time, and inspecting under your car\u2019s hood (while wearing a mask) \u201cfor obvious gnawings and rat droppings.\u201d\n However, his primary concern when it comes to rodents and coronavirus is less car-specific than rat-general: that people will overlook rat control while preoccupied with airborne virus transmission.\n \u201cRodents can carry leptospirosis, toxoplasma, hanta, salmonella and ostensibly Covid-19,\u201d he said. While there is currently no evidence rats can become infected with the virus, \u201cthey can transmit from paws or fur.\u201d Besides spreading disease, rats can cause house fires by chewing through electrical wiring \u2014 and, of course, they can disable vehicles.\n \u201cTheir nature,\u201d said Mr. Deutsch, \u201cis to explore. They do exhibit a behavior called neophobia, which is fear of new things. But they can overcome that.\u201d\n   If you\u2019ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n  This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on  how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \u201cHow will we know when to reopen the country?\u201d In  an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson  staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs  ...\n  The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts  donations here.  Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the  American Red Cross, and  World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related  GoFundMe fund-raisershave started  ...\n  The C.D.C. has  recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting  new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don \u2019t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they  ...\n  If you\u2019re sick and you think you\u2019ve been exposed to the new coronavirus,  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there\u2019s a chance \u2014 because of a lack of testing kits or because you\u2019re asymptomatic, for instance \u2014 you won\u2019t be able to get tested.\n  It seems to spread  very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n  No.  Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n  Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and  little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions \u2014 not just those with respiratory diseases \u2014 particularly hard.\n  If the family member doesn\u2019t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible,  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C.If there \u2019s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not  ...\n  Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves,  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n  Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don\u2019t live in your home.  Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n  That\u2019s not a good idea. Even if you\u2019re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year\u2019s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n  Watching your balance go up and down can be scary.  You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions \u2014 don\u2019t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you\u2019re at least saving as much as you can to get that \u201cfree money.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:58:10", "tags":

"note_en": "If you are interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies, crypto networks, and blockchain technology, here\u2019s a short collection of some of our pieces. Be sure to also check out the a16z  Crypto Canon, where we previously compiled resources from around the web across various categories and levels of interest.\n  In a space that evolves as rapidly as crypto, no one really is an expert. But knowing where to start can help make the subject more approachable to anyone. To that end, this glossary of terminology and key concepts in the space covers the basics of cryptography and blockchain, smart contracts and applications, security/privacy, and other useful definitions. We hope it serves as both an introduction and as a reference for newcomers  and crypto veterans alike.\n  Blockchains are computers that can make commitments. Traditional computers are ultimately controlled by people, either directly or indirectly; blockchains invert this power relationship, putting the code in charge. A properly designed blockchain provides strong guarantees that the code it runs will continue to operate as designed. For the first time, a computer system can be truly autonomous: self-governed, by its own code, instead of by people.\n  Here are three common myths people have when first hearing about crypto: that cryptocurrencies are anonymous (and therefore more likely to be used by criminals); that there\u2019s no real use case (aside from speculation); and that crypto is just about currency. Wrong, wrong, and wrong.\n  Millions of users have had their private data misused or stolen. Creators and businesses that rely on internet platforms are subject to sudden rule changes that take away their audiences and profits. But there is a growing movement \u2014 emerging from the blockchain and cryptocurrency world \u2014 to build new internet services that combine the power of modern, centralized services with the community-led ethos of the original internet. We should embrace it.\n  The combination of cloud, social, and mobile took gaming beyond a small base of just console- and PC-gamers to a massive player base. But the underlying business model \u2014 the concept of \u201cfree-to-play\u201d, built on top of games-as-a-service \u2014 may have been the real innovation that led us to the global gaming phenomena we have today. Unfortunately, balancing the gamers who  aren\u2019t\u00a0paying with those who\u00a0 are becomes incredibly challenging over time because incentives between game publishers and players  ...\n  Software is simply the encoding of human thought, and as such has an almost unbounded design space. We find ourselves consistently surprised and excited by the wide variety of creative crypto ideas we encounter. For those of us who have been involved in software for a long time, it feels like the early days of the internet, web 2.0, or smartphones all over again.\n  The internet is still early in its evolution: the core internet services will likely be almost entirely rearchitected in the coming decades. This will be enabled by crypto-economic networks, a generalization of the ideas first introduced in Bitcoin and further developed in Ethereum. Cryptonetworks combine the best features of the first two internet eras: community-governed, decentralized networks with capabilities that will eventually exceed those of the most advanced centralized services.  ...\n  Crypto founders have a unique challenge in front of them. In addition to building a product that people want, they also need to consider how that product can successfully run in a decentralized manner \u2014that is, as a protocol owned and operated by a community of users. This is a difficult challenge because much of what it takes to build a successful product at the outset \u2014product leadership, rapid iteration, a managed go-to-market \u2014complicates the path to community ownership and regulatory  ...\n  Since much of the existing regulatory framework was written before the advent of such decentralized networks, it\u2019s useful to consider both how these networks evolve over their lifetimes, as well as the history and evolution of the classic \u201cHowey test\u201d that determines whether or not they\u2019re also investment contracts for regulatory and compliance purposes. Because that, in turn, affects their effective use and scalability as software systems and services.\n  Given how little accessible and accurate information is out there about how regulatory agencies actually work, we share some thoughts on how SEC investigations happen (across all industries, not just crypto); how network usage may impact whether a cryptocurrency is deemed a security; and what the industry might expect next. The arguments of recent cases are interesting, because they are representative of how the entire industry is dealing with an emerging technology where it \u2019s still unclear  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:58:06", "tags": "\u52a0\u5bc6,understanding,\u7f51\u7edc,crypto", "title": "\u4e86\u89e3\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u548c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8d44\u6e90", "title_en": "Resources for understanding cryptocurrency and blockchain technology", "transed": 0, "url": "https://a16z.com/2020/04/30/explaining-crypto-from-a16z/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u52a0\u5bc6", "\u7f51\u7edc", "crypto"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000199, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f80\u8fd4http\u8bf7\u6c42\u5230\u4e0a\u6e38\uff1a\u62e8\u53f7TCP\uff1a\u67e5\u627e\u9879\uff1a\u6ca1\u6709\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u4e3b\u673a", "note_en": "Unable to round-trip http request to upstream: dial tcp: lookup item: no such host", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:57:58", "tags": "\u5b9e\u4e60,cuts,http,trip", "title": "Lyft\u5c06\u5b9e\u4e60\u5de5\u8d44\u524a\u51cf50%", "title_en": "Lyft cuts internship salaries by 50%", "transed": 0, "url": "http://item?id=23047687", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u5b9e\u4e60", "cuts", "http", "trip"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d6113dc444af5092a529a685e39dafdb.png", "infoid": 1000198, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6ca1\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u88c5\u8f7d\u673a\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u5c06\u60a8\u7684\u6587\u6863\u4e0e\u51e0\u4e2a\u8d85\u7ea7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u4e00\u8d77\u53d1\u9001\u3002\n\u652f\u6301\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u4eceAngularJS\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230Vue\u6216Reaction\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002\nSetup Pitsby\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u5b83\u4eec\u6709\u591a\u7b80\u5355\u3002\nPitsby\u914d\u7f6e\u5e94\u5728\u60a8\u5e0c\u671b\u4e3a\u5176\u521b\u5efa\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6839\u76ee\u5f55\u4e2d\u521b\u5efa\u3002\u5b83\u8d1f\u8d23\u544a\u8bc9Pitsby*.doc.js\u6587\u4ef6\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\uff0c\u7b49\u7b49\u3002\n\u60a8\u5e94\u8be5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a*.doc.js\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u4f7f\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5219\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684*doc.js\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\n\u6784\u5efa\u8bbe\u7f6e\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u548c\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u6863\u6587\u4ef6\u540e\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u751f\u6210\u8fd0\u884c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5404\u9879\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\uff1a\nPitsby\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\u4f7f\u7528http-server\u6216\u60a8\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6lib\u4e3a\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\nHTTP-server./Pitsby\u3002\n\u76d1\u89c6\u8981\u4fdd\u6301Pitsby\u76d1\u89c6\u60a8\u5bf9\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5217\u51fa\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u6587\u4ef6\u6240\u505a\u7684\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u8bf7\u8fd0\u884c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u547d\u4ee4\uff1a\n\u76ae\u8328\u6bd4\u5efa\u7b51--\u770b\u7740\u3002\nPitsby\u7edd\u5bf9\u662f\u4ee4\u4eba\u656c\u754f\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u7684-\u5728\u8bb0\u5f55\u7ec4\u4ef6\u65f6\u6ca1\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9999\u8349\uff01", "note_en": "No rules.

"note_en": "Today, there are two main ways to run compute workloads on GPU. One is CUDA, which has a fantastic ecosystem including highly tuned libraries, but is (in practice) tied to Nvidia hardware. The other is graphics APIs used primarily for gaming, which run on a wide variety of hardware, but historically offer much less power than CUDA. Also, the tooling for compute in that space is terrible. Historically, a lot of compute has also been done with OpenCL, but its future is cloudy as it \u2019s been officially  ...\n Vulkan has been catching up fast in its raw capabilities, with recent extensions supporting more advanced GPU compute features such as subgroups, pointers, and a memory model. Is it getting to the point where it can run serious compute workloads?\n In this blog post are some initial explorations into implementing  prefix sum on recent Vulkan. I have a rough first draft implementation which suggests that Vulkan might be a viable platform, for a sufficiently persistent implementor.\n  As Hacker News user fluffything points out in  this HN thread on my  Taste of GPU compute talk, prefix sum is an excellent benchmark for evaluating GPU compute languages and runtimes.\n For one, it is useful in and of itself. I use it in  font-rs to integrate fragments of exact-area computations to arrive at the total area coverage for font rendering. It is also used as a primitive in many more operations, including GPU-side dynamic allocation and  compaction.\n For two, it is simple. The sequential version can be expressed in just a handful of lines of code:\n def  prefix_sum ( a ):  s  =  0  result  =  []  for  x  in  a :  s  +=  x  result . append ( s )  return  result\n For three, it is challenging but possible to implement efficiently on GPU. The above code has a strictly sequential dependency, but because addition is associative, it is possible to exploit a great deal of parallelism, and there is literature on that going back decades. Even so, efficiently exploiting that parallelism on GPU requires communication between invocations (\u201cthreads\u201d in more common GPU lingo) and careful attention to the memory hierarchy.\n The generalization of prefix sum is called \u201cscan,\u201d and works with any associative operation, not just addition. It doesn\u2019t even have to be commutative; examples of that include  regular expressions and  IIR filtering. More precisely, a scan can be done with any  monoid, a structure with an identity element as well as the associative operation; the identity element is required for the \u201cexclusive\u201d variant of scan, as it is the first element of the output.\n  The state of the art is  decoupled look-back. I\u2019m not going to try to summarize the algorithm here, but recommend reading the paper. The results are impressive \u2014 for large data sets, they report reaching memcpy speeds, meaning that no further speedup is possible.\n That work is a refinement of  Parallel Prefix Sum (Scan) with CUDA from Nvidia\u2019s GPU Gems 3 book. A production-quality, open source implementation is  CUB. Another implementation, designed to be more accessible but not as optimized, is  ModernGPU scan.\n My own  implementation is very much a research-quality proof of concept. It exists as the  prefix branch of the  piet-gpurepository. Basically, I wanted to determine whether it was possible to come within a stone \u2019s throw of memcpy performance using Vulkan compute kernels. It \u2019s a fairly straightforward implementation of the decoupled look-back paper, and doesn \u2019t implement all the tricks. For example, the look-back is entirely sequential; I didn \u2019t parallelize the look-back as suggested  ...\n The implementation is enough of a rough prototype I don \u2019t yet want to do careful performance evaluation, but initial results are encouraging: it takes 2.05ms of GPU time to compute the prefix sum of 64Mi 32-bit unsigned integers on a GTX 1080, a rate of 31.2 billion elements/second. Since each element involves reading and writing 4 bytes, that corresponds to a raw memory bandwidth of around 262GiB/s. The theoretical memory bandwidth is listed as 320GB/s, so clearly the code is able  ...\n  One of the achievements of \u201cmodern C++\u201d is the C++11 memory model. In the olden days, the mechanism for lock-free programming patterns in C and C++ was the  volatile qualifier and various nonstandard barrier intrinsics. People reasoned about these operationally \u2014 the primary function of  volatile was to disable certain optimizations, and the barrier intrinsics compile to a memory fence instruction, which generally cause hardware to flush caches.\n Today, most lock-free aficionados consider those times to be barbaric. The semantics of  volatile were never clearly defined for the purpose of multithreading (though people used it anyway, because it appeared to be useful), and the barrier instructions had the disturbing property of being hardware specific. Because x86 has \u201ctotal store order,\u201d barrier instructions are generally not needed for  publication safety. However, the same code on, say, ARM, which has more weakly ordered memory  ...\n With the C++11 memory model, the programmer specifies the needed ordering constraints precisely. The compiler can then optimize the program very aggressively, as long as it meets those constraints. For example, acquire and release semantics (the basis of publication safety) will compile to explicit memory fence instructions on ARM, but to nothing on x86. A good writeup is the blog post  C++ atomics and memory ordering.\n The new  Vulkan memory modelbrings the same idea to GPU compute. I used it in my code, in large part because I wanted to experiment with it. I \u2019ve done a fair amount of lock-free code using the C++ memory model. And lock-free code, while fairly rare on the CPU (my main motivation is to avoid priority inversion for real time audio), is more or less required on the GPU, because mutex is not available in kernel code. Even if it were, it would create a lot of problems, as it would block  ...\n Is a memory model absolutely required to run this code? If you replace the atomic loads and stores with simple array accesses, it deadlocks. However, at least on my hardware, correct operation can be recovered by adding the  volatile qualifier to the  WorkBuf array. As with older style C++, there are two risks. Though it seems to work reliably and efficiently on my hardware, it\u2019s possible the  volatilequalifier and explicit fences cause more cache flushing than is needed, or suppress  ...\n We\u2019re already seeing variation in hardware that requires different levels of vigilance for memory semantics. On most GPU hardware, the invocations (threads) within a subgroup (warp) execute in lock-step, and thus don\u2019t require any synchronization. However, as of Nvidia Volta, the hardware is capable of  independent thread scheduling. Correct code will add explicit memory semantics even within a subgroup, which will, as in total store order on x86, compile to nothing on hardware  ...\n In my research for this blog post, I did not come across any evidence of people actually using the Vulkan memory model, i.e. no search hits for the relevant identifiers other than work associated with the spec. Thus, one contribution of this blog post is to show a concrete example of code that uses it.\n  On GPU, it\u2019s easiest to run workloads that use static allocation, for example a fixed size buffer per workgroup, and workgroups arranged in a 2D grid (\u201cdispatch\u201d operations support 1D and 3D as well). But dynamic allocation is possible, with care.\n The two major approaches to dynamic allocation are prefix sum and atomic bump allocation. The main reason for one over the other is whether you care about the ordering. Let\u2019s take a simple problem of computing some function on an array of input values, where the output is variable sized.\n Using a prefix-sum approach, you run a first pass of computing the size of the output. The prefix sum of that result yields an offset into an output buffer. The second pass (after the prefix sum) computes the function and writes it into the output buffer, using the offset provided by the prefix sum. [Also note that if we \u2019re getting really fancy, it might be possible to fuse either or both of these passes with the prefix sum itself, decreasing the amount of global memory  ...\n An atomic bump allocation approach simply does   atomicAdd on each output, using a bump allocation index (effectively a pointer) as the first argument and the size of the allocation as the second. This yields results broadly similar to the prefix sum approach, but with the outputs in arbitrary order. Perhaps the order is not important, or, alternatively, a sort pass can be applied afterwards (sorting on GPU is another topic with a rich literature).\n The two can be combined. For example, it makes sense to do a prefix sum of the sizes of items within a workgroup, and a single atomic bump allocation for the per-workgroup total.\n One problem that might benefit from prefix sum for dynamic allocation is  flattening B\u00e9zier curves to polylines. Each B\u00e9zier segment can be computed in parallel, but you generally want to preserve the order of segments within the full path. The flattening algorithm I presented in that blog post (and its  generalization to cubics) fits nicely into this framework \u2014it \u2019s already in two passes, where the first computes the number of segments required, and the second can compute  ...\n  High performance prefix sum requires coordination between threads \u2014 it\u2019s possible to extract some parallelism by running O(log n) tree reduction passes, each of which pulls only from the previous pass, but this would be considerably slower than state of the art. Coordination must be at all levels of the hierarchy. GPU compute has always made threadgroup shared memory available for such coordination. An even faster but newer capability is  subgroups, not yet universally  ...\n My prototype code uses subgroups extensively. One serious limitation is that it assumes a subgroup size of 32, which is true for some hardware. However, other hardware has different size subgroups, and then Intel is special.\n By default, when compiling a compute kernel, the Intel drivers use a  heuristicto determine the subgroup size, which can then be 8, 16, or 32. It actually makes sense they use a heuristic, as there \u2019s a complex tradeoff. A bigger subgroup means bigger chunks of work, which means less per-chunk overhead, but also fewer registers available per thread, and potentially more wasted work due to divergence. Again, that depends on workloads. For low-probability, expensive conditional  ...\n It might be  possible to write a kernel that adapts to subgroup size, but there are a number of considerations that make this tricky. One is whether the number of items processed by a workgroup adapts to subgroup size. If so, then the size of the dispatch must be adapted as well. There is an  extensionfor the CPU side to query subgroup size of a pipeline, but, sadly, it doesn \u2019t seem to be implemented on Intel drivers on Windows, where it would be most useful. (It is,  ...\n Another problem is querying the subgroup size from inside the kernel, which has a surprising gotcha. By default, the  gl_SubgroupSize variable is defined to have the value from  VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupProperties, which in my experiment is always 32 on Intel no matter the actual subgroup size.\n Newer (Vulkan 1.2) Intel drivers offer the ability to both accurately query and control over the subgroup size, with the  VK_EXT_subgroup_size_control extension. With that extension, setting the  VK_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_ALLOW_VARYING_SUBGROUP_SIZE_BIT_EXT at pipeline creation time makes  gl_subgroupSizebehave as expected. Also, I can set the subgroup size to 32, and the kernel works fine. Note though that in general, setting a too-large subgroup size can actually  ...\n On RDNA-based AMD cards, the subgroup size extension lets you get subgroups of 32 on RDNA-based AMD cards, though the default is 64.\n In practice, the programmer will write multiple versions of the kernel, each tuned for a different subgroup size, then on CPU side the code will query the hardware for supported subgroup sizes and choose the best one that can run on the hardware. Note that, in general, querying the range of supported subgroup sizes requires the subgroup size extension to be reliable, though you do string-matching on the device name to come up with a good guess. Note that the  specialization  ...\n Brian Merchant has done more exploration into the tradeoff between subgroups and threadgroup shared memory, for a different primitive operation, transpose of 32x32 boolean matrices. That  transpose timing writeup contains measurements on a variety of hardware, and is recommended to the interested reader.\n  The  subgroupInclusiveAdd function seems like it\u2019s doing a lot \u2014 it\u2019s performing a prefix sum operation on an entire subgroup\u2019s worth of data. Does hardware contain an assembly instruction that directly implements it? What if you want to do an operation other than addition, where there isn\u2019t an intrinsic available?\n Obviously different hardware will be different, but looking at the Radeon GPU Analyzer output on  Shader Playground tells us a lot. It generates a tree reduction (the Hillis-Steele algorithm as presented in the  prefix sum Wikipedia page) with lg(n) stages of subgroup shuffle + add. Since subgroup shuffle is available in Vulkan (but see below), if you were to write out such a reduction you\u2019d be able to get similar results.\n On AMD hardware there is one additional twist:  AMD has an additional level of hierarchy between subgroup (64 invocations, 1 wavefront) and invocation (thread). Internally, the hardware is organized around a  row of 16 elements. Access to elements within a row uses a different instruction modifier ( row_shr) than across the entire wave ( row_bcast or  wave_ror, for two examples), and is likely lower latency in the chip. The Vulkan subgroup extensions provide a powerful  ...\n  It is tempting to use a portability layer such as gfx-hal to run compute workloads on a variety of graphics APIs. (Other such portability layers include MoltenVK for running Vulkan on top of Metal, and similar work for running  OpenCL on DX12). But such an approach is limited to the lowest common denominator \u2014 it can\u2019t provide capabilities that are missing in the underlying layer.\n   Also note that gfx-hal currently doesn\u2019t give access to Shader Model 6 intrinsics (subgroup operations), but there\u2019s an  issue and hopefully that will be fixed.\n  Metal is closer to Vulkan in capabilities (especially newer versions), but still lacks subgroup size control and a memory model.\n  I covered a fair number of GPU compute infrastructure projects in my talk and the associated  GPU resources list. Since then I\u2019ve learned of quite a few more:\n vuda, which runs (SPIR-V) compute workloads using an API similar to the CUDA host API.\n    OpenCL 3.0 is announced, with a number of strategies to rescue OpenCL from a fate of irrelevance.\n I am also optimistic about  WebGPU becoming a viable platform for compute workloads, both delivered over the web and in native implementations such as  wgpu.\n Echoing fluffything\u2019s comment, I propose adopting prefix sum as something of a \u201chello world\u201d benchmark of GPU compute. It\u2019s simple enough it should be practical to implement without too much effort (and if not, that\u2019s also an important data point), it exercises \u201cadvanced\u201d features such as subgroup shuffles, and it\u2019s reasonably easy to quantify. When looking at these potential infrastructure projects, ask these questions:\n  The result of my explorations on Vulkan suggest (but do not yet prove) good answers to these questions, but at the expense of doing a lot of the low-level legwork yourself, and programming the kernel in a very low-level style (in GLSL). I think there\u2019s a huge opportunity for more sophisticated tools.\n Also, I think it\u2019s a great benchmark for the emerging field of GPU-friendly languages. Is it possible to express the algorithm in a reasonably high-level manner? If so, does it compile to code with competitive performance? Can we write a high-performance abstraction as a library that can be consumed easily? Can that abstraction offer portability across hardware but hide the complexity from its users? Can you provide your own monoid?\n  I \u2019ve showed that Vulkan can do prefix sum with near state of the art performance. However, I \u2019ve also outlined some of the challenges involved in writing Vulkan compute kernels that run portably and with high performance. The lower levels of the stack are becoming solid, enabling a determined programmer to ship high performance compute across a wide range of the hardware, but there is also an opportunity for much better tooling at the higher levels.  ...\n Thanks to Brian Merchant, Matt Keeter, and msiglreith for discussions on these topics, and Jason Ekstrand for setting me straight on subgroup size concerns

power grid would &#34;present significant risks to our economy, human health and safety, and would render the United States less capable of acting in defense of itself and its allies.&#34;\n The White

Despite President Trump citing hacking threats as a primary reason for signing the new order, the US has not seen any destructive attacks from foreign hackers until now.\n   Instead, the US power grid

"note_en": "This blog post discloses a sandbox escape on macOS. I reported the issue to Apple Product Security on December 19 2019, the day the Apple Security Bounty program finally opened. (I discovered the issue in August 2019.) Today I received an email from Apple Product Security saying &#34;we do not see any actual security implications.&#34; I&#39;ve heard this kind of response  before\u2014they don&#39;t see any security implications \u2026until they do \u2014but in any case I obviously won&#39;t be receiving a bounty  ...\n Attached is a sample Xcode project that demonstrates how a sandboxed Mac app can escape the sandbox with one click. This sandbox escape works on the current public shipping version macOS 10.15.2. I&#39;ve also tested on macOS 10.14.6.\n To reproduce, build and run the sample app. Then click to allow when the system dialog asks if the sample app can control TextEdit via Apple Events. This will allow the sample app to create a file named &#34;escaped&#34; in the directory &#34;/Users/Shared&#34;, outside the sandbox. You&#39;ll also hear the app say &#34;hi&#34; to signal that it&#39;s successfully escaped the sandbox. The sample app has actually launched a shell script, &#34;test.sh&#34;, which can run any arbitrary code outside the sandbox.\n The sandbox escape is made possible by the entitlement &#34;com.apple.security.files.user-selected.executable&#34; possessed by TextEdit. It&#39;s also possessed by some Mac App Store apps such as BBEdit. (Note that while TextEdit and BBEdit are themselves sandboxed, this entitlement would also allow them to escape their own sandbox. Thus, any app with the &#34;com.apple.security.files.user-selected.executable&#34; entitlement is only nominally sandboxed, effectively not sandboxed.)\n Normally, when a sandboxed app writes to a file, the file is quarantined. If the file is a shell script, then the quarantine extended attribute would prevent the script from running. However, when an app such as TextEdit with the &#34;com.apple.security.files.user-selected.executable&#34; entitlement saves a file, it removes the quarantine extended attribute!\n My sample app opens a shell script in TextEdit, and then it uses the Apple Events permission to tell TextEdit to save the file, thus removing the quarantine and allowing the script to be executed outside the app&#39;s sandbox.\n This should appear very innocuous to the user, because nobody thinks that TextEdit is dangerous, so one would think it&#39;s not much of a risk to allow TextEdit to be controlled.\n Note that I chose the directory  /Users/Shared to avoid macOS &#34;privacy protections&#34; that prevent interaction with various other directories such as Desktop, Documents, and Downloads. Note also that this issue (if you consider it an issue) still exists on the latest version 10.15.4 of macOS.\n  I&#39;ve written a  new blog post that attempts to clarify a number of issues raised here.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:57:37", "tags": "mac,\u6c99\u76d2,sandbox,\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f,textedit", "title": "MAC\u6c99\u76d2\u8f6c\u4e49", "title_en": "Mac sandbox escape", "transed": 0, "url": "https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/sandbox-escape.html", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["mac", "\u6c99\u76d2", "sandbox", "\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f", "textedit"]}]
