"note_en": "Two people with beta thalassaemia and one with sickle cell disease no longer require blood transfusions, which are normally used to treat severe forms of these inherited diseases, after their bone marrow stem cells were gene-edited with  CRISPR.\n Result of the ongoing trial, which is the first to use CRISPR to treat inherited genetic disorders, were announced today at a virtual meeting of the European Hematology Association.\n \u201cThe preliminary results\u2026 demonstrate, in essence, a functional cure for patients with beta thalassaemia and sickle cell disease,\u201d team member Haydar Frangoul at Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, Tennessee,  said in a statement.\n   Beta thalassaemia and sickle cell are diseases caused by  mutations that affect haemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells.\u00a0Those with severe forms require regular blood transfusions.\n However, a few people with the disease-causing mutations never show any symptoms, because they keep producing fetal haemoglobin in adulthood. Normally, fetal haemoglobin stops being produced soon after birth.\n  This discovery has inspired the development of treatments based on boosting fetal haemoglobin. In this trial, run by collaborating companies CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex, bone marrow stem cells are removed from people and the gene that turns off fetal haemoglobin production is disabled with CRISPR.\n The remaining bone marrow cells are killed by chemotherapy, then replaced by the edited cells. This is done to ensure new blood cells are produced by the edited stem cells, but the chemotherapy can have serious side effects including infertility.\n The first two patients with beta thalassaemia no longer need blood transfusions since being treated 15 and 5 months ago. Nor does the patient with sickle cell disease, 9 months after treatment.\n  The results are excellent, says Marina Cavazzana at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris, France, whose team  has treated a 13-year-old boy with sickle cell disease using a different approach.\n While the three patients did suffer some adverse effects due to the chemotherapy, the CRISPR gene editing appears safe. However, the patients may need to be monitored for the rest of their lives to be sure it has no adverse effects, says Cavazzana.\n Altogether five people have now been treated. The trial was put on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic, but has now resumed.\n Sign up to our free  Health Check newsletter for a monthly round-up of all the health and fitness news you need to

"note_en": "Jung wrote this essay as the introduction to a \r book about Ramana Maharshi by Heinrich Zimmer. 1 \r Paragraph numbers are from Jung\u2019s  Collected Works.\n      Heinrich Zimmer had been interested for years in the Maharshi of\rTiruvannamalai, and the first question he asked me on my return from India\rconcerned this latest holy and wise man from southern India. I do not know\rwhether my friend found it an unforgivable or an incomprehensible sin on\rmy part that I had not sought out Shri Ramana. I had the feeling that he\rwould certainly not have neglected to pay him a visit, so warm was his\rinterest in the life and thought of the holy man. This was scarcely\rsurprising, as I know how deeply Zimmer had penetrated into the spirit of\rIndia. His most ardent wish to see India in reality was unfortunately never\rfulfilled, and the one chance he had of doing so fell through in the last\rhours before the outbreak of the second World War. As if in compensation,\rhis vision of the spiritual India was all the more magnificent. In our work\rtogether he gave me invaluable insights into the Oriental psyche, not only\rthrough his immense technical knowledge, but above all through his\rbrilliant grasp of the meaning and content of Indian mythology. Unhappily,\rthe early death of those beloved of the gods was fulfilled in him, and it\rremains for us to mourn the loss of a spirit that overcame the limitations of\rthe specialist and, turning towards humanity, bestowed upon it the joyous\rgift of \u201cimmortal fruit.\u201d\r\r \r\rThe carrier of mythological and philosophical wisdom in India has\rbeen since time immemorial the \u201choly man\u201d\u2014a Western title which does\rnot quite render the essence and outward appearance of the parallel figure\rin the East. This figure is the embodiment of the spiritual India, and we\rmeet him again and again in the literature. No wonder, then, that Zimmer\rwas passionately interested in the latest and best incarnation of this type in\rthe phenomenal personage of Shri Ramana. He saw in this yogi the true\ravatar of the figure of the rishi, seer and philosopher, which strides, as\rlegendary as it is historical, down the centuries and the ages.\r\r \r\rPerhaps I should have visited Shri Ramana. Yet I fear that if I\rjourneyed to India a second time to make up for my omission, it would fare\rwith me just the same: I simply could not, despite the uniqueness of the\roccasion, bring myself to visit this undoubtedly distinguished man\rpersonally. For the fact is, I doubt his uniqueness; he is of a type which\ralways was and will be. Therefore it was not necessary to seek him out. I\rsaw him all over India, in the pictures of Ramakrishna, in Ramakrishna\u2019s\rdisciples, in Buddhist monks, in innumerable other figures of the daily\rIndian scene, and the words of his wisdom are the sous-entendu of India\u2019s\rspiritual life. Shri Ramana is, in a sense, a hominum homo, a true \u201cson of\rman\u201d of the Indian earth. He is \u201cgenuine,\u201d and on top of that he is a\r\u201cphenomenon\u201d which, seen through European eyes, has claims to\runiqueness. But in India he is merely the whitest spot on a white surface\r(whose whiteness is mentioned only because there are so many surfaces\rthat are just as black). Altogether, one sees so much in India that in the end\rone only wishes one could see less: the enormous variety of countries and\rhuman beings creates a longing for complete simplicity. This simplicity is\rthere too; it pervades the spiritual life of India like a pleasant fragrance or a\rmelody. It is everywhere the same, but never monotonous, endlessly varied.\rTo get to know it, it is sufficient to read an Upanishad or any discourse of\rthe Buddha. What is heard there is heard everywhere; it speaks out of a\rmillion eyes, it expresses itself in countless gestures, and there is no village\ror country road where that broad-branched tree cannot be found in whose\rshade the ego struggles for its own abolition, drowning the world of\rmultiplicity in the All and All-Oneness of Universal Being. This note rang\rso insistently in my ears that soon I was no longer able to shake off its\rspell. I was then absolutely certain that no one could ever get beyond this,\rleast of all the Indian holy man himself; and should Shri Ramana say\ranything that did not chime in with this melody, or claim to know anything\rthat transcended it, his illumination would assuredly be false. The holy man\ris right when he intones India\u2019s ancient chants, but wrong when he pipes\rany other tune. This effortless drone of argumentation, so suited to the heat\rof southern India, made me refrain, without regret, from a visit to\rTiruvannamalai.\r\r \r\rNevertheless, the unfathomableness of India saw to it that I should\rencounter the holy man after all, and in a form that was more congenial to\rme, without my seeking him out: in Trivandrum, the capital of Travancore,\rI ran across a disciple of the Maharshi. He was an unassuming little man, of\ra social status which we would describe as that of a primary-school teacher,\rand he reminded me most vividly of the shoemaker of Alexandria who (in\rAnatole France\u2019s story) was presented to St. Anthony by the angel as an\rexample of an even greater saint than he. Like the shoemaker, my little holy\rman had innumerable children to feed and was making special sacrifices in\rorder that his eldest son might be educated. (I will not enter here into the\rclosely allied question as to whether holy men are always wise, and\rconversely, whether all wise men are unconditionally holy. In this respect\rthere is room for doubt.) Be that as it may, in this modest, kindly, devout,\rand childlike spirit I encountered a man who had absorbed the wisdom of\rthe Maharshi with utter devotion, and at the same time had surpassed his\rmaster because, notwithstanding his cleverness and holiness, he had\r\u201ceaten\u201d the world. I acknowledge with deep gratitude this meeting with\rhim; nothing better could have happened to me. The man who is only wise\rand only holy interests me about as much as the skeleton of a rare saurian,\rwhich would not move me to tears. The insane contradiction, on the other\rhand, between existence beyond M\u0101y\u0101 in the cosmic Self, and that amiable\rhuman weakness which fruitfully sinks many roots into the black earth,\rrepeating for all eternity the weaving and rending of the veil as the ageless\rmelody of India\u2014this contradiction fascinates me; for how else can one\rperceive the light without the shadow, hear the silence without the noise,\rattain wisdom without foolishness? The experience of holiness may well be\rthe most painful of all. My man\u2014thank God\u2014was only a little holy man;\rno radiant peak above the dark abysses, no shattering sport of nature, but an\rexample of how wisdom, holiness, and humanity can dwell together in\rharmony, richly, pleasantly, sweetly, peacefully, and patiently, without\rlimiting one another, without being peculiar, causing no surprise, in no way\rsensational, necessitating no special post-office, yet embodying an age-old\rculture amid the gentle murmur of the coconut palms fanning themselves in\rthe light sea wind. He has found a meaning in the rushing phantasmagoria\rof Being, freedom in bondage, victory in defeat.\r\r \r\rUnadulterated wisdom and unadulterated holiness, I fear, are seen to\rbest advantage in literature, where their reputation remains undisputed.\rLao-tzu reads exquisitely, unsurpassably well, in the Tao Teh Ching; Laotzu with his dancing girl on the Western slope of the mountain, celebrating\rthe evening of life, is rather less edifying. But even less can one approve of\rthe neglected body of the \u201cunadulterated\u201d holy man, especially if one\rbelieves that beauty is one of the most excellent of God\u2019s creations.\r\r \r\rShri Ramana\u2019s thoughts are beautiful to read. What we find here is\rpurest India, the breath of eternity, scorning and scorned by the world. It is\rthe song of the ages, resounding, like the shrilling of crickets on a\rsummer\u2019s night, from a million beings. This melody is built up on the one\rgreat theme, which, veiling its monotony under a thousand colourful\rreflections, tirelessly and everlastingly rejuvenates itself in the Indian spirit,\rwhose youngest incarnation is Shri Ramana himself. It is the drama of\rahamk\u0101ra, the \u201cI-maker\u201d or ego-consciousness, in opposition and\rindissoluble bondage to the atman, the self or non-ego. The Maharshi also\rcalls the atman the \u201cego-ego\u201d\u2014significantly enough, for the self is indeed\rexperienced as the subject of the subject, as the true source and controller\rof the ego, whose (mistaken) strivings are continually directed towards\rappropriating the very autonomy which is intimated to it by the self.\r\r \r\rThis conflict is not unknown to the Westerner: for him it is the\rrelationship of man to God. The modern Indian, as I can testify from my\rown experience, has largely adopted European habits of language, \u201cself\u201d or\r\u201catman\u201d being essentially synonymous with \u201cGod.\u201d But, in\rcontradistinction to the Western \u201cman and God,\u201d the Indian posits the\ropposition (or correspondence) between \u201cego and self.\u201d \u201cEgo,\u201d as\rcontrasted with \u201cman,\u201d is a distinctly psychological concept, and so is\r\u201cself\u201d\u2014to our way of thinking. We might therefore be inclined to assume\rthat in India the metaphysical problem \u201cman and God\u201d has been shifted on\rto the psychological plane. On closer inspection it is clear that this is not so,\rfor the Indian concept of \u201cego\u201d and \u201cself\u201d is not really psychological but\u2014\rone could well say\u2014just as metaphysical as our \u201cman and God.\u201d The\rIndian lacks the epistemological standpoint just as much as our own\rreligious language does. He is still \u201cpre-Kantian.\u201d This complication is\runknown in India and it is still largely unknown with us. In India there is\rno psychology in our sense of the word. India is \u201cpre-psychological\u201d: when\rit speaks of the \u201cself,\u201d it posits such a thing as existing. Psychology does\rnot do this. It does not in any sense deny the existence of the dramatic\rconflict, but reserves the right to the poverty, or the riches, of not knowing\rabout the self. Though very well acquainted with the self\u2019s peculiar and\rparadoxical phenomenology, we remain conscious of the fact that we are\rdiscerning, with the limited means at our disposal, something essentially\runknown and expressing it in terms of psychic structures which may not be\radequate to the nature of what is to be known.\r\r \r\rThis epistemological limitation keeps us at a remove from what we\rterm \u201cself\u201d or \u201cGod.\u201d The equation self = God is shocking to the European.\rAs Shri Ramana\u2019s statements and many others show, it is a specifically\rEastern insight, to which psychology has nothing further to say except that\rit is not within its competence to differentiate between the two. Psychology\rcan only establish that the empiricism of the \u201cself\u201d exhibits a religious\rsymptomatology, just as does that category of assertions associated with the\rterm \u201cGod.\u201d Although the phenomenon of religious exaltation transcends\repistemological criticism\u2014a feature it shares with all manifestations of\remotion\u2014yet the human urge to knowledge asserts itself again and again\rwith \u201cungodly\u201d or \u201cLuciferian\u201d obstinacy and wilfulness, indeed with\rnecessity, whether it be to the loss or gain of the thinking man. Sooner or\rlater he will place his reason in opposition to the emotion that grips him\rand seek to withdraw from its entangling grasp in order to give an account\rof what has happened. If he proceeds prudently and conscientiously, he will\rcontinually discover that at least a part of his experience is a humanly\rlimited interpretation, as was the case with Ignatius Loyola and his vision\rof the snake with multiple eyes, which he at first regarded as of divine, and\rlater as of diabolical, origin. (Compare the exhortation in I John 4:1: \u201cDo\rnot believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God.\u201d)\rTo the Indian it is clear that the self as the originating ground of the psyche\ris not different from God, and that, so far as a man is in the self, he is not\ronly contained in God but actually is God. Shri Ramana is quite explicit on\rthis point. No doubt this equation, too, is an \u201cinterpretation.\u201d Equally, it is\ran interpretation to regard the self as the highest good or as the goal of all\rdesire and fulfilment, although the phenomenology of such an experience\rleaves no doubt that these characteristics exist a priori and are\rindispensable components of religious exaltation. But that will not prevent\rthe critical intellect from questioning the validity of these characteristics. It\ris difficult to see how this question could be answered, as the intellect lacks\rthe necessary criteria. Anything that might serve as a criterion is subject in\rturn to the critical question of validity. The only thing that can decide here\ris the preponderance of psychic facts.\r\r \r\rThe goal of Eastern religious practice is the same as that of Western\rmysticism: the shifting of the centre of gravity from the ego to the self,\rfrom man to God. This means that the ego disappears in the self, and man\rin God. It is evident that Shri Ramana has either really been more or less\rabsorbed by the self, or has at least struggled earnestly all his life to\rextinguish his ego in it. The Exercitia spiritualia reveal a similar striving:\rthey subordinate \u201cself-possession\u201d (possession of an ego) as much as\rpossible to possession by Christ. Shri Ramana\u2019s elder contemporary,\rRamakrishna, had the same attitude concerning the relation to the self, only\rin his case the dilemma between ego and self seems to emerge more\rdistinctly. Whereas Shri Ramana displays a \u201csympathetic\u201d tolerance\rtowards the worldly callings of his disciples, while yet exalting the\rextinction of the ego as the real goal of spiritual exertion, Ramakrishna\rshows a rather more hesitant attitude in this respect. He says: \u201cSo long as\rego-seeking exists, neither knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101na) nor liberation (mukti) is\rpossible, and to births and deaths there is no end.\u201d 2 All the same, he has to\radmit the fatal tenacity of ahamk\u0101ra (the \u201cI-maker\u201d): \u201cVery few can get rid\rof the sense of \u2018I\u2019 through sam\u0101dhi.\u2026 We may discriminate a thousand\rtimes, but the sense of \u2018I\u2019 is bound to return again and again. You may cut\rdown the branches of a fig-tree today, but tomorrow you will see that new\rtwigs are sprouting.\u201d 3\rHe goes so far as to suggest the indestructibility of\rthe ego with the words: \u201cIf this sense of \u2018I\u2019 will not leave, then let it stay on\ras the servant of God.\u201d 4\rCompared with this concession to the ego, Shri\rRamana is definitely the more radical or, in the sense of Indian tradition,\rthe more conservative. Though the elder, Ramakrishna is the more modern\rof the two, and this is probably to be attributed to the fact that he was\raffected by the Western attitude of mind far more profoundly than was Shri\rRamana.\r\r \r\rIf we conceive of the self as the essence of psychic wholeness, i.e., as\rthe totality of conscious and unconscious, we do so because it does in fact\rrepresent something like a goal of psychic development, and this\rirrespective of all conscious opinions and expectations. The self is the\rsubject-matter of a process that generally runs its course outside\rconsciousness and makes its presence felt only by a kind of long-range\reffect. A critical attitude towards this natural process allows us to raise\rquestions which are excluded at the outset by the formula self = God. This\rformula shows the dissolution of the ego in the atman to be the unequivocal\rgoal of religion and ethics, as exemplified in the life and thought of Shri\rRamana. The same is obviously true of Christian mysticism, which differs\rfrom Oriental philosophy only through having a different terminology. The\rinevitable consequence is the depreciation and abolition of the physical and\rpsychic man (i.e., of the living body and ahamk\u0101ra) in favour of the\rpneumatic man. Shri Ramana speaks of his body as \u201cthis clod.\u201d As against\rthis, and taking into consideration the complex nature of human experience\r(emotion plus interpretation), the critical standpoint admits the importance\rof ego-consciousness, well knowing that without ahamk\u0101ra there would be\rabsolutely no one there to register what was happening. Without the\rMaharshi\u2019s personal ego, which, as a matter of brute experience, only exists\rin conjunction with the said \u201cclod\u201d (= body), there would be no Shri\rRamana at all. Even if we agreed with him that it is no longer his ego, but\rthe atman speaking, it is still the psychic structure of consciousness in\rassociation with the body that makes speech communication possible.\rWithout this admittedly very troublesome physical and psychic man, the\rself would be entirely without substance, as Angelus Silesius has already\rsaid:\r\r I know that without me \rGod can no moment live; \rWere I to die, then he \rNo longer could survive.\n  \r\rThe intrinsically goal-like quality of the self and the urge to realize\rthis goal are, as we have said, not dependent on the participation of\rconsciousness. They cannot be denied any more than one can deny one\u2019s\rego-consciousness. It, too, puts forward its claims peremptorily, and very\roften in overt or covert opposition to the needs of the evolving self. In\rreality, i.e., with few exceptions, the entelechy of the self consists in a\rsuccession of endless compromises, ego and self laboriously keeping the\rscales balanced if all is to go well. Too great a swing to one side or the\rother is often no more than an example of how not to set about it. This\rcertainly does not mean that extremes, when they occur in a natural way,\rare in themselves evil. We make the right use of them when we examine\rtheir meaning, and they give us ample opportunity to do this in a manner\rdeserving our gratitude. Exceptional human beings, carefully hedged about\rand secluded, are invariably a gift of nature, enriching and widening the\rscope of our consciousness\u2014but only if our capacity for reflection does not\rsuffer shipwreck. Enthusiasm can be a veritable gift of the gods or a\rmonster from hell. With the hybris which attends it, corruption sets in, even\rif the resultant clouding of consciousness seems to put the attainment of the\rhighest goals almost within one\u2019s grasp. The only true and lasting gain is\rheightened and broadened reflection.\r\r \r\rBanalities apart, there is unfortunately no philosophical or\rpsychological proposition that does not immediately have to be reversed.\rThus reflection as an end in itself is nothing but a limitation if it cannot\rstand firm in the turmoil of chaotic extremes, just as mere dynamism for its\rown sake leads to inanity. Everything requires for its existence its own\ropposite, or else it fades into nothingness. The ego needs the self and vice\rversa. The changing relations between these two entities constitute a field\rof experience which Eastern introspection has exploited to a degree almost\runattainable to Western man. The philosophy of the East, although so\rvastly different from ours, could be an inestimable treasure for us too; but,\rin order to possess it, we must first earn it. Shri Ramana\u2019s words, which\rHeinrich Zimmer has bequeathed to us, in excellent translation, as the last\rgift of his pen, bring together once again the loftiest insights that the spirit\rof India has garnered in the course of the ages, and the individual life and\rwork of the Maharshi illustrate once again the passionate striving of the\rIndian for the liberating \u201cGround.\u201d I say \u201conce again,\u201d because India is\rabout to take the fateful step of becoming a State and entering into a\rcommunity of nations whose guiding principles have anything and\reverything on the programme except detachment and peace of the soul.\r\r The Eastern peoples are threatened with a rapid collapse of their spiritual values, and what replaces them cannot always be counted among the best that Western civilization has produced. From this point of view, one could regard Ramakrishna and Shri Ramana as modern prophets, who play the same compensatory role in relation to their people as that of the Old Testament prophets in

Hoffman, once a close advisor to the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs, has criticized leadership at Facebook for not being accountable for some of the harmful effects the social media platform has had on society.\n Hoffman was responding to a question, at the 2020 CogX conference on Tuesday, about the cult of leadership in the technology industry and how people can decouple ego from their work.\n  &#34;As I look at Facebook, for example, I keep thinking are they really that ignorant or is this motivated by something \u2026 darker than what appears?&#34; she said on a panel with former colleagues of Apple&#39;s offshoot technology company General Magic.\n While Hoffman said she had &#34;enormous respect&#34; for what Facebook had achieved she suggested certain aspects of the social media giant were &#34;destroying the very fabric of democracy, destroying the very fabric of human relationships and peddling in an addictive drug called anger.&#34;\n  &#34;You know it&#39;s just like tobacco, it&#39;s no different than the opioids,&#34; she added. &#34;We know anger is addictive, we know we can attract people to our platform and get engagement if we get them p----d off enough. So therefore what, we should capitalize on that each and every time?&#34;\n  Facebook has most recently come under fire for its  decision not to moderate or take down a post by President Donald Trump, in which he said &#34;when the looting starts, the shooting starts,&#34; in reference to the George Floyd protests.\n  Civil rights leaders said they were  &#34;disappointed and stunned&#34; by Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s &#34;incomprehensible explanations&#34; for keeping Trump&#39;s post up, after a Zoom call with the Facebook CEO and COO Sheryl Sandberg last week.\n Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan have since said they were &#34;deeply shaken and disgusted by President Trump&#39;s divisive and incendiary rhetoric,&#34; in a  letter shared on Twitter. Their comments were in response to criticism from scientists funded by their\u00a0Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) over Facebook&#39;s handling of Trump&#39;s post.\n   Hoffman also said that &#34;leadership is extremely important,&#34; that &#34;individuals make a huge difference&#34; to a company and that without a &#34;leader to bring it all together, then nothing really productive results in the end.&#34;\n However, she added that we have to accept that leaders are human beings and are therefore going to be flawed.\n  She believed there were a lot of leaders who existed today who were &#34;genius in what they&#39;ve accomplished and what they have done at a very young age&#34; but added that she found they were &#34;remarkably ignorant on what they are sowing in the world.&#34;\n Hoffman joined Apple in 1980, as the fifth member of the team working on the Macintosh project \u2014 the first iteration of the Mac computer \u2014 and focused on product marketing. She then joined Steve Jobs at his own software business NeXT, which was eventually bought by Apple.\n During her time working with Jobs, Hoffman became known as one of the few people who could challenge the Apple co-founder. Kate Winslet&#39;s portrayal of Hoffman in the 2015 movie &#34;Steve Jobs&#34; reinforced this image of her as Jobs&#39; &#34;right-hand woman.&#34;\n Hoffman later became vice president of marketing at General Magic, leaving in 1995.

In tests, it was able to drop the accuracy of three state-of-the-art NLP systems dramatically. For example, Google\u2019s powerful BERT neural net was worse by a factor of five to seven at identifying whether reviews on Yelp were positive or negative.\n They tested the attack on NLP systems trained to do tasks such as identify news topics, detect fake news, and analyze sentiment. In all cases, the AI  became significantly worse.\n How it works: The software, developed by a team at MIT, looks for the words in a sentence that are most important to an NLP classifier and replaces them with a synonym that a human would find natural. For example, changing the sentence \u201cThe characters, cast in impossibly contrived situations, are totally estranged from reality\u201d to \u201cThe characters, cast in impossibly engineered circumstances, are fully estranged from reality\u201d makes no real difference to how we read it. But the tweaks made an AI interpret the sentences completely differently.\n Why it matters: We have seen many examples of such  adversarial attacks, most often with image recognition systems, where tiny alterations to the input can flummox an AI and make it misclassify what it sees. TextFooler shows that this style of attack also breaks NLP, the AI behind virtual assistants\u2014such as Siri, Alexa and Google Home\u2014as well as other language classifiers like spam filters and hate-speech detectors. The researchers say that tools like TextFooler can help make NLP systems more robust, by revealing their weaknesses.", "posttime": "2020-06-14 13:57:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "I&#39;ve stumbled upon a unique bug (or perhaps feature, from the carriers&#39; perspective) relating to what appears to be keyword blacklisting in SMS messages: From what I can tell in my limited testing, outbound text messages from some devices on the T-Mobile network are being silently blocked if they contain the phrase &#34;verification code&#34; anywhere in their content, but  only when they are sent to certain combinations of carriers and devices. I&#39;m posting here to see if users with more knowledge surrounding mobile networks and platforms can provide any insight, or chime in to say if this is known/expected behavior. I apologize for the wall of text that follows (you can just look at the tables and tl;dr for the gist of the matter), but I&#39;m aiming to be as descriptive as possible to help others reproduce the issue.\n Brief background: I&#39;m the resident techie for friends and family, and I frequently help troubleshoot issues with various online services. When doing so, I&#39;ll occasionally need to log into their accounts directly from my computer, and for the accounts that have an OTP-based 2FA that&#39;s sent out via SMS, I just ask them to forward the text message they receive containing the verification code to my phone so I can complete the authentication process. This past week, I ran into two separate instances where I was helping someone with an account secured with SMS 2FA and there was significant difficulty communicating the requisite code, to the point that it piqued my interest and started me down the path of troubleshooting.\n In the first instance, a friend said they had forwarded me the code message from the service, but nothing appeared on my end. I had the service send a new OTP code to them, and they once again said they had forwarded it to me , but I still didn&#39;t see anything on my end. We tried the same loop of the system re-sending and them forwarding once more, with the same result. At this point, I chalked it up to some generic SMS issues and had them just call me with the code so I could complete the login process and move forward. The only thing that struck me as odd was that their text messages about  sending me the codes were coming through just fine, even though the messages with the codes were apparently failing to arrive. They sent me a screenshot of their side of the conversation, and it did indeed show the messages successfully going out on their end, but I still chalked it up to some sort of temporary glitch and didn&#39;t devote further thought to it at the time.\n Yesterday, however, I had an inversion of the same behavior occur: When I sent an SMS to a family member asking them to pass on their verification code to me, they didn&#39;t respond at all, and when I asked them about it, they said they never received my text. Recalling what had happened earlier in the week, I looked back at the screenshots of the texts and considered what commonalities there were between the two conversations. The messages that the friend had attempted to forward and those I sent requesting the code were all relatively short and did not contain any unique characters so far as I could tell, so I couldn&#39;t imagine it being an issue with SMS length cap triggering MMS conversion or anything else that I had historically seen drive transmission issues. The sole consistent factor I could identify among the messages was that they all contained the exact phrase &#34;verification code&#34; somewhere within them.\n I didn&#39;t think it was likely that specific words would have an impact on text delivery, but since I had no other hypotheses, I decided it was worth at least performing a quick test. I sent the same family member a message with the simple phrase  This is a verification code test. and asked them to tell me if it arrived. They received my text asking them to respond, but the original message containing the words &#34;verification code&#34; never arrived. After waiting a couple of minutes to ensure it wasn&#39;t just a delay, I tried sending a generic text with the phrase  Test message., which arrived immediately. I tried the original phrase twice more, with it failing to arrive on the opposite end both times. I then had the other party try sending the original phrase back to me, and the message arrived immediately, so the issue didn&#39;t appear to be bi-directional. Looking back at the screenshots of the conversation from earlier in the week, I saw that my message to the friend containing the words &#34;verification code&#34; arrived successfully, so the issue similarly appears unidirectional in that instance, although on the other end of the conversation.\n Having established the basic behavior, my next instinct was to test permutations to see if I could determine the scope/shape of the blockage. I sent a series of similar messages, with the following results:\n    The pattern of successes and failures leads me to believe that whatever is causing the issue is performing a regex match along the lines of:  /v[^a-z\\d]*e[^a-z\\d]*r[^a-z\\d]*i[^a-z\\d]*f[^a-z\\d]*i[^a-z\\d]*c[^a-z\\d]*a[^a-z\\d]*t[^a-z\\d]*i[^a-z\\d]*o[^a-z\\d]*n[^a-z\\d]*[^a-z\\d]*c[^a-z\\d]*o[^a-z\\d]*d[^a-z\\d]*e/gi\n Essentially, it&#39;s blocking the specific phrase &#34;verification code&#34; with any permutation of non-alphanumeric characters intermingled.\n  Since my phone is a Pixel 3a XL on the T-Mobile network, and the family member I was communicating with for these tests has an iPhone on Verizon, my next steps were to attempt to determine whether the issue was correlated with a specific device, platform/OS, carrier, or combination of the above. I contacted the few people I knew who wouldn&#39;t mind taking time out of a Friday evening to troubleshoot an odd mobile network glitch and asked them to perform a basic test, attempting to send the phrase &#34;This is a verification code test.&#34; in both directions. I quickly ruled out the specific device model being a factor, which left the following based on carrier/OS combinations:\n    &#34;S&#34; represents a successful transmission of the phrase &#34;This is a verification code test.&#34; via text message.\n &#34;x&#34; represents the message failing to arrive on the recipient&#39;s end, even if it shows success on sender&#39;s end.\n  Most of the table is obviously incomplete, but I will try to back-fill it as I gather further results or receive data from other users here. Based on the limited data set I was able to compile on short notice, my first interpretation was that it was a block between the T-Mobile and Verizon networks, because the failures appeared to occur only in the direction of T-Mobile to Verizon, agnostic of the device platform/OS. However, when I hit the outlier of a T-Mobile iPhone failing to send to T-Mobile Android, that threw a wrench in my network hypothesis. I&#39;m not comfortable making a final judgment with only a single sample (albeit repeatable) in that pairing, so I&#39;d like to get at least one other person with a T-Mobile iPhone that can verify the unidirectional failure of transmission to T-Mobile Android.  EDIT: Another user has run the same tests of T-Mobile iPhone to T-Mobile Android successfully, so I&#39;m inclined to discount the pairing that&#39;s failing as a fluke, which would turn the focus back solely to the directional communications from T-Mobile to Verizon.\n The only guess I&#39;m able to venture about this behavior is that it&#39;s the result of a fraud protection mechanism (attempting to protect users from SMS scams) that is suffering from an over-zealous ruleset, but I&#39;m stumped as to why it would only affect certain combinations of devices and networks if that is the case.\n If anyone has friends/family/colleagues with combinations of devices for which I haven&#39;t been able to procure data (or for which I lack multiple samples), and you don&#39;t mind taking a couple minutes out of your day to run a some quick tests, please post your results in the comments and I&#39;ll try to keep the table updated.\n  tl;dr: It appears that SMS messages containing the phrase &#34;verification code&#34; (and any permutations with non-alphanumeric separators) are being silently blocked when transmitting from T-Mobile to certain combinations of networks and devices (with all of Verizon failing to receive being the most conspicuous example). I&#39;m looking to gather more data from anyone who can provide it, or to get feedback from an expert on whether this is known, expected behavior.\n  EDIT: With further testing (report from  u/DJB719), it appears that the one sample of failure from T-Mobile iPhone to T-Mobile Android may be a fluke, meaning the only reproducible errors are from T-Mobile to Verizon. That suggests that this issue could be an error on Verizon&#39;s end performing inbound message filtering from the T-Mobile network. If further results point in that direction, it may be worth having one of the Verizon subscribers call to speak with their tech support, as well.", "posttime": "2020-06-14 13:07:26", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5c4f\u853d,blocking,mobile", "title": "T-Mobile\u5c4f\u853d\u5305\u542b\u77ed\u8bed\u201c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u201d\u7684\u51fa\u7ad9\u77ed\u4fe1", "title_en": "T-Mobile blocking outbound SMS containing the phrase \u201cverification code\u201d", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/h8cotr/tmobile_silently_blocking_outbound_sms_messages/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5c4f\u853d", "blocking", "mobile"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5e274873563d8a1f5237d50dfce71f83.jpg", "infoid": 1006500, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u662f\u7266\u725b\u96c6\u4f53\u5728\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u91cc\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u5bf9\u6b64\u62a5\u544a\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u8bf7\u52a1\u5fc5\u5148\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u201c\u4e0d\u8981\u6d6a\u8d39\u91cd\u542f\u201d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\u91cd\u542f\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\uff0c\u5b83\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f60\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u4f55\u5730\u65b9\u770b\u5230\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5230\u8fbe\u5b83\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002\n\u5c31\u50cf\u4f60\u5728\u8fd9\u526f\u724c\u4e0a\u770b\u5230\u7684\u2002\u7684\u788e\u7247\u4e00\u6837\uff1f\u6b22\u8fce\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4eba\u6295\u7a3f\u4eba\uff01\u7266\u725b\u96c6\u4f53\u65e2\u4e0d\u662f\u4e2d\u4ecb\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u4e2d\u4ecb\u673a\u6784\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6210\u5458\u5408\u4f5c\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u60f3\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7740\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u54a8\u8be2\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4f9b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6346\u7ed1\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u3002\n\u559c\u6b22\u4f60\u770b\u5230\u7684\u5f88\u591a\u4e1c\u897f\u5417\uff1f\u8054\u7cfb\u5e15\u6885\u62c9\u00b7\u970d\u5df4\u7279(Pamela Hobart)\uff0c\u8ba9Yak Collective\u53c2\u4e0e\u60a8\u7684\u91cd\u542f\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u7ec4\u5efa\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5c0f\u56e2\u961f\u548c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0e\u60a8\u5408\u4f5c\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u6216\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e3a\u60a8\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u56e2\u961f\u4e3e\u529e\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u6216\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fbf\u5229\u3002\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u662f\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u4eba\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002\n\u60f3\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u73b0\u573a\u76f4\u64ad\u5417\uff1f\u52a0\u5165\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e0d\u548c\u8c10\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u3002\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u81ea\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u6709\u60f3\u6cd5\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u987e\u95ee\u52a0\u5165\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u9879\u76ee\u505a\u51fa\u8d21\u732e\u5e76\u9886\u5bfc\u5408\u4f5c\u9879\u76ee\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e5f\u6b22\u8fce\u4efb\u4f55\u6f5c\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u6765\u8fd9\u91cc\u95f2\u901b\u3002", "note_en": "This deck is the  second in a series of studies the Yak Collective is undertaking over the coming months.

"note_en": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Even as Facebook grappled this month with  an internal revolt and  a cascade of criticism over its refusal to take action on President Trump\u2019s inflammatory posts, the social network was actively making other bets behind the scenes.\n Late one Tuesday, as attention was focused on how Facebook might handle Mr. Trump, the Silicon Valley company said in  a brief blog post that it had invested in Gojek, a \u201csuper app\u201d in Southeast Asia. The deal, which gave Facebook a bigger foothold in the rapidly growing region, followed  a $5.7 billion investment it recently pumped into Reliance Jio, a telecom giant in India.\n The moves were part of a spending spree by the social network, which also shelled out $400 million last month to buy an animated GIF company and which is spending millions of dollars to build a nearly 23,000-mile undersea  fiber-optic cable encircling Africa. On Thursday, Facebook  confirmed that it was also developing a venture capital fund to invest in promising start-ups.\n Other technology giants are engaging in similar behavior. Apple has bought at least four companies this year and released a new iPhone. Microsoft has purchased three cloud computing businesses. Amazon is in talks to acquire an autonomous vehicle start-up, has leased more airplanes for delivery and has hired an additional 175,000 people since March. Google has  unveiled new messaging and video features.\n Even with the global economy  reeling from a pandemic-induced recession and dozens of businesses filing for bankruptcy, tech\u2019s largest companies \u2014 still wildly profitable and flush with billions of dollars from years of corporate dominance \u2014 are deliberately laying the groundwork for a future where they will be bigger and more powerful than ever.\n Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are aggressively placing new bets as the coronavirus pandemic has made them  near-essential services, with people turning to them to shop online, entertain themselves and stay in touch with loved ones. The skyrocketing use has given the companies new fuel to invest as other industries retrench.\n The expansion is unfolding as lawmakers and regulators in Washington and Europe are sounding the alarm over the tech giants\u2019 concentration of power and how that may have hurt competitors and led to other issues, such as spreading disinformation. This week, European Union officials were preparing  antitrust charges against Amazon for using its e-commerce dominance to box out smaller rivals, while  Britain began an inquiry into Facebook\u2019s purchase of the GIF company.\n Some of the tech behemoths have made little secret of their intention to forge ahead in a recession that has put  more than 44 million Americans out of work and that officials warn  will be protracted.\n  \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that in times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is keep investing in building the future,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in an investor call last month. \u201cWhen the world changes quickly, people have new needs, and that means there are more new things to build.\u201d\n In doubling down on growth in a time of economic pain, the largest tech companies are continuing a pattern. In previous recessions, those that invested while the economy was at its most vulnerable often emerged stronger.

"note_en": "State naming practices and local, customary naming practices are strikingly different. Each set of practices is designed to make the human and physical landscape  legible, by sharply identifying a unique individual, a household, or a singular geographic feature. Yet they are each devised by very distinct agents for whom the purposes of identification are radically different. Purely local, customary practices, as we shall see, achieve a level of precision and clarity\u2014often with impressive economy\u2014perfectly suited to the needs of knowledgeable locals. State naming practices are, by contrast, constructed to guide an official \u201cstranger\u201d in unambiguously identifying persons and places, not just in a single locality, but in many localities using standardized administrative\u00a0techniques.\n To follow the progress of state-making is, among other things, to trace the elaboration and application of novel systems which name and classify places, roads, people, and, above all, property. These state projects of legibility overlay, and often supersede, local practices. Where local practices persist, they are typically relevant to a narrower and narrower range of interaction within the confines of a face-to-face\u00a0community.\n A contrast between local names for roads and state names for roads will help illustrate the two variants of legibility. There is, for example, a small road joining the towns of Durham and Guilford in the U.S. state of Connecticut. Those who live in Durham call this road (among themselves) the \u201cGuilford Road,\u201d presumably because it informs the inhabitants of Durham exactly where they\u2019ll get to if they travel it. The same road, at its Guilford terminus, is called, the \u201cDurham Road\u201d because it tells the inhabitants of Guilford where the road will lead them. One imagines that at some liminal midpoint, the road hovers between these two identities. Such names work perfectly well; they each encode valuable local knowledge, namely what is perhaps the most important fact one might want to know about a road. That the same road has two names, depending on one\u2019s location, demonstrates the situational, contingent nature of local naming practices. Informal, \u201cfolk\u201d naming practices not only produce the anomaly of a road with two or more names; they also produce many different roads with the same name. Thus, the nearby towns of Killingworth, Haddam, Madison, and Meriden each have roads leading to Durham, each of which the inhabitants locally call the \u201cDurham\u00a0Road.\u201d\n Now imagine the insuperable problems that this locally effective folk system would pose to an outsider requiring unambiguous identifications for each road. Let\u2019s imagine, for example, that you have been in an automobile accident on the road between Durham and Guilford and are in danger of bleeding to death. You call 911 and tell them you need an ambulance and, when they ask your location, you tell them that you are on the Durham Road. The ambulance dispatcher would then have to ask, \u201cWhich Durham Road?\u201d It is, thus, no surprise that the road between Durham and Guilford is re-incarnated on all state maps and designations as \u201cRoute 77\u201d: a scheme whereby each state road is assigned a unique number in a potentially infinite series. There can now be no ambiguity about the road on which you are bleeding. Each micro-segment of that route, moreover, is identified by means of telephone pole serial numbers, milestones, and township boundaries. The naming practices of the state require a synoptic view, a standardized scheme of identification generating mutually exclusive and exhaustive\u00a0designations.\n All vernacular place names, personal names, and names of roads or rivers encode important knowledge. Some of that knowledge is a thumbnail history; for example Maiden Lane denotes the lane where five spinster sisters once lived, while Cider Hill Road is the road up the hill where the Cider Mill and orchard once stood. At one time, when the name became fixed, it was probably the most relevant and useful name for local inhabitants. Other names refer to geographical features: Mica Ridge Road, Bare Rock Road, Ball Brook Road. The sum of roads and place names in a small place, in fact, amounts to something of a local geography and history if one knows the stories, features, episodes, and family enterprises encoded within\u00a0them.\n For officials who require a radically different form of order, such local knowledge, however quaint, is illegible. It privileges particular knowledge over synoptic, standardized knowledge. In the case of colonial rule, when the conquerors speak an entirely different language, the unintelligibility of the vernacular landscape is a nearly insurmountable obstacle to effective rule. Renaming much of the landscape therefore is an essential step of imperial rule. This explains why the British Ordinance Survey of Ireland in the 1830s recorded and rendered many local Gaelic place names (e.g., Bun na hAbhann, Gaelic for \u201cmouth of the river\u201d) in a form (Burnfoot) more easily understood by the\u00a0rulers.\n  It is both striking and important to recognize how relatively little the pre-modern state actually knew about the society over which it presided. State officials had only the most tenuous idea of the population under their jurisdiction, its movements, its real property, wealth, crop yields, and so forth. Their degree of ignorance was directly proportional to the fragmentation of their sources of information. Local currencies and local measures of capacity (e.g., the bushel) and length (the ell, the rod, the  toise) were likely to vary from place to place and with the nature of the transacting parties. The opacity of local society was, of course, actively maintained by local elites as one effective means of resistance to intrusions from\u00a0above.\n Having little synoptic, aggregate intelligence about the manpower and resources available to it, officials were apt either to overreach in their exactions, touching off flight or revolt, or to fail to mobilize the resources that were, in fact, available. To follow the process of state-making, then, is to follow  the conquest of illegibility. The account of this conquest \u2014 an achievement won against stiff resistance \u2014 could take many forms, for example: the creation of the cadastral survey and uniform property registers, the invention and imposition of the meter, national censuses and currencies, and the development of uniform legal\u00a0codes.\n Given the variability of vernacular naming practices, the early modern state found it difficult even to identify particular individuals within a community without local cooperation. A banal example from a mediocre film,  Witness, will illustrate the problem. In this film Harrison Ford plays a detective trying to track down a young boy who, he believes, witnessed a murder in bus station. The boy, he learns, comes from an Amish family. He arrives in the area with only a name and turns to that classical instrument of modern police work, the telephone directory. What is a telephone directory, after all, but an alphabetical listing of names, addresses, along with the unique  number assigned to them, which serves in turn as the means of contacting them. But the Amish do not use phones, and he is stymied. He knows the last name (patronym) of the boy, but, it turns out that, as a relatively closed community, many Amish share common last names (e.g. Hoover, Boop). Again he is at an impasse. The success of his investigation, and the love interest in the film, turns on his enlisting the cooperation of the boy\u2019s mother (played by Kelly McGillis). The point is that when confronted with an illegible, vernacular community such as the Amish, an outsider, and by extension the state, can only navigate with the help of a \u201clocal tracker\u201d willing to share his or her knowledge. Having no other independent, reliable compass, the outsider is liable to be manipulated by that local\u00a0tracker.\n The permanent patronym, which most Westerners have come to take for granted, is in fact a comparatively new phenomenon. The invention of permanent inherited patronyms was, along with the standardization of weights and measures, uniform legal codes, and the cadastral land tenure survey, a vital technique in modern statecraft. It was, in nearly every case, a state project designed to allow officials to identify unambiguously the majority of its citizens. The armature of the modern state: tithe and tax rolls, property rolls, conscription lists, censuses, deeds, birth, marriage and death certificates recognized in law were inconceivable without some means of fixing an individual\u2019s identity and linking him or her to a kin group. The permanent patronym was, in effect, the now long superseded precursor to modern photo-ID cards, passports, fingerprints, personal identification numbers, fingerprints, iris scans, and, finally DNA\u00a0typing.\n Until at least the fourteenth century, the great majority of Europeans did not have permanent patronyms. An individual\u2019s name was typically his given name, which normally would suffice for local, vernacular. If something else were required, a second local designation was added indicating (in the English case), say, occupation (smith, miller, baker), geographical location (edgewood, hill), the father\u2019s  given name (in Jewish and Middle Eastern practice preceded by \u201cben\u201d \u201cibn\u201d \u201cbin\u201d or in the Celtic case preceded by \u201cO\u2019\u201d, \u201cMc\u201d, \u201cAp\u201d or, as in the French case, simply appended, as hypothetically with Victor (son of) Hugo) or a personal characteristic (strong, short, doolittle, fair, newcomb). These secondary designations, however, were not permanent surnames, they did not generally survive their\u00a0bearers.\n The acquisition of last names is, in fact, an exceptionally sensitive measure of the growing reach of the state. The census [or  catasto] of the Florentine state in 1427 was an audacious (and failed) attempt to rationalize the administration of revenue and manpower resources by recording the names, wealth, residences, land-holdings, and ages of the city-state\u2019s inhabitants. At the time, virtually the only Tuscan family names were those of a handful of great families [e.g., Strozzi] whose kin, including affines, adopted the name as a way of claiming the backing of a powerful corporate group. The vast majority were identified reasonably unambiguously by the registrars, but  not by personal patronyms. They might list their father and grandfather (e.g., Luigi, son of Paulo, son of Giovanni) or they might add a nickname, a profession, or a personal characteristic. It is reasonably clear that what we are witnessing, in the  catasto exercise, are the first stages of an administrative crystallization of personal surnames. And the geography of this crystallization traced, almost perfectly, the administrative presence of the Florentine state. While one-third of the households in the city declared a second name, the proportion dropped to one-fifth in secondary towns, and then to a low of one-tenth in the countryside. The small, tightly knit vernacular world had no need for a \u201cproper name\u201d: such names were, for all practical purposes, official names confined to administrative life. Many of the inhabitants of the poorest and most remote areas of Tuscany \u2014 those with the least contact with officialdom \u2014 only acquired family names in the seventeenth century. Nor were fifteenth-century Tuscans in much doubt about the purpose of the exercise; its failure was largely due to their foot-dragging and resistance. As the case of Florence illustrates, the naming project, like the standardization of measurements and cadastral surveys, was very much a purposeful state\u00a0mission.\n Western state-making in the seventeenth and eighteenth imposed permanent patronyms as a condition of citizenship. It became well nigh universal with the exception of Iceland which, for folkloric reasons in most cases, mandates the old Norse system (i.e. Magnus Eric son, Katrin J\u00f3ns d\u00f3ttir). The telephone directory there lists subscribers by given name and occupation. Nations such as Iran, Turkey, and Thailand that have imposed permanent patronym as a state project in the twentieth century have until comparatively recently organized the phonebook alphabetically by given name. The imposition of permanent, anglicized patronyms on indigenous peoples of North America coincided, in the United States, with the issuance of property deeds connected to efforts to seizing the bulk of tribal lands, and in Canada among the Inuit, with interventions by the welfare and health bureaucracies. Both episodes make for a reading that is filled with equal parts of hilarity and melancholy.[1] Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia and much of the Middle East have not adopted permanent patronyms but now have moved to more modern technologies of personal\u00a0identification.\n  The quest for legibility, when joined to state power, is not merely an \u201cobservation.\u201d By a kind of fiscal Heisenberg principle, it has the capacity the change the world it observes. The window and door tax established in France under the Directory and abolished only in 1917 is a striking case in point. Its originator must have reasoned that the number of windows and doors in a dwelling was almost perfectly proportionate to the dwelling\u2019s size. Thus a tax assessor need only walk around the house counting the windows and doors to estimate its size. As a simple expedient, it was a brilliant stroke, but not without consequences. Peasant dwellings were subsequently designed or renovated with the formula in mind so as to have as few apertures as possible! While the fiscal losses could be recouped by raising the tax per opening, the effects on the long term health of the rural population lasted for than a\u00a0century.\n The window and door tax illustrates something else about \u201cstate optics\u201d; they achieve their formidable power of resolution by a kind of tunnel vision that brings into sharp focus a single aspect of an otherwise far more complex and unwieldy reality. This very simplification makes the phenomenon at the center of the field of vision more legible and hence more susceptible to careful measurement and calculation. Combined with similar observations, an overall, aggregate, synoptic view of a selective reality is achieved, making possible a high degree of schematic knowledge, control and\u00a0manipulation.\n  I found this process strikingly evident in the invention of scientific forestry in 18th-century Prussia and Saxony. An abbreviated account of forest \u201cscience\u201d can serve both as a model for processes of state-simplification as well as the advantages and disadvantages it entails.[2] The lens, as it were, for this simplification was \u201ccameral science\u201d: the efforts to rationalize the revenue of the princely states. To that end, the forests were reconceptualized as streams of salable commodities, above all so many thousands of board feet of timber and so many cords of wood fetching a certain price. The crown\u2019s interest we resolved through its fiscal lens into a single number representing the revenue yield that might be extracted annually from the domainal forests. The truly heroic simplification involved here is most evident in what was left out of this utilitarian and minimalist conception of the forest. Missing were all those trees, bushes, and plants holding little or no potential for crown revenue. Missing as well were all those parts of trees, even revenue-bearing trees, which might have been of great use to the population but whose value could not easily be converted into fiscal receipts. Here I have in mind foliage and its uses as fodder and thatch, fruits and nuts as food for people, domestic animals, and game. Twigs and branches as bedding, fence posts, hop poles, and kindling; bark and roots for making medicines and for tanning; sap for resins, and so\u00a0forth.\n From a naturalist\u2019s perspective, nearly everything was missing from the state\u2019s narrow frame of reference. Gone was the vast majority of flora: grasses, flowers, lichens, mosses, mushrooms, shrubs, and vines, Gone too, were reptiles, birds, amphibians, fish, and innumerable species of insects. Gone were most species of fauna, except for the large game integral to the aristocratic\u00a0hunt.\n The utilitarian state could, quite literally, not see the real existing forest for the (commercial) trees. New techniques of measurement were developed. Representative samples of the forest were designated; five classes of tree size ( Normalba\u00fcme) were specified, the timber yield of each was estimated using the cone-volume principles of solid geometry, and a complete census of a representative section was carried out to determine the distribution of trees by size class. This knowledge, coupled with careful assumptions about rates of growth made possible the tables from which the scientific forester devised a plan of extraction based on what was assumed to be the maximum sustainable\u00a0yield.\n It is, however, the next logical step in German scientific forestry that commands our attention. That step was to attempt to create through careful seeding, planting and cutting, a redesigned forest that was easier to count, manipulate, measure, and assess. Thus was born the modern, \u201cproduction\u201d forest: a mono-cropped (Norway spruce or Scotch pine), same-age, timber-farm planted in straight rows. The very uniformity of the forest vastly simplified its management and exploitation. Forestry crews could follow a few simple rules for clearing the underbrush, trimming and fertilizing; the mature trees of comparable girth and length could be felled into the alleys and marketed as homogeneous units to logging contractors and timber merchants. For nearly a century, during which German scientific forestry as a codified discipline became the world standard, the \u201cproduction forest\u201d was a resounding success in terms of steady yields at low\u00a0cost.\n Redesigning the forest as a \u201cone-commodity machine,\u201d however, had, in the long run, catastrophic consequences for forest health and production. The mono-cropped, same-age forest was far more vulnerable to disease, blight, and storm damage. Its simplicity and formal order, together with the elimination of underbrush, deadfalls and litter dramatically reduced the diversity of the flora, insect, mammal, and bird populations so essential to soil building processes. Once the soil capital deposited by the old-growth forest had been depleted, the new forest entered a period of steep decline in growth and production. The term \u201c Waldsterben\u201d entered the vocabulary of modern forestry science and led, in turn, to huge outlays for fertilizers, rodenticides, fungicides and insecticides as well as efforts to artificially reintroduce birds, insects and mammals that had disappeared. By redesigning the complex and poorly understood ecology of the old-growth forest as a veritable wood-fiber farm and bracketing everything else, scientific forestry had destroyed a vernacular forest and a host of ecological processes that came back to haunt\u00a0it.\n  The example of scientific forestry is meant here as a signal and cautionary example of the dangers of the forms of simplification typical of states and large bureaucratic organizations. In  Seeing Like a State, I developed several examples in considerable detail: the imposition of uniform land tenure and cadastral surveys on vernacular forms of land tenure; the imposition of uniform legal codes on vernacular customs, the replacement of dialects with a national language, the design (or redesign) of abstractly planned cities (e.g. Brasilia) compared to \u201cvernacular\u201d unplanned towns, the forced resettlement of peasants and pastoralists in poor countries compared to \u201cvernacular\u201d movement and settlement, agricultural collectivization compared with small-holder mixed farming, and, finally, the difference between praxis or vernacular knowledge on the one hand and epistemic knowledge on the other. The emphasis, throughout, is on the processes whereby hierarchical organiza\n......", "posttime": "2020-06-14 12:15:31", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Welcome to the first ever interview on &#39;The Observer Effect&#39;. When planning for these series of interviews with interesting leaders and institutions, there was only one person I had in mind to have here first - Marc Andreessen.\n  Marc is one of the most notable and influential figures in the history of the internet. We were lucky to have a wide ranging conversation with him on how he spends his time, how he tries to set goals for himself, how he reads so much, what keeps him so plugged in after all of these years and what he wants people to build. Marc was generous and open with his responses and I hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I did.\n  Note: This interview was recorded in mid May 2020 before we hit major crises in this country. Therefore we don\u2019t address any of the very painful issues that we all struggle with.\n  Sriram Krishan    Let\u2019s start off on a very serious note. Marc - what are the odds of you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tregretting agreeing to this interview in the first place?\n  Marc Andreessen   [[laughs]]  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can see how much public stuff I&#39;m doing these days. And so you can gauge that pretty\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taccurately.\n    Let\u2019s get into it. Over a decade ago, you wrote a famous post called the  \u201cPmarca\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tguide to productivity\u201d.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is the 2020 version of the Marc Andreessen guide to productivity?\n  The big thing is I&#39;ve basically done a complete 180 degrees off of the model that I had\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom 13-14 years ago. A lot\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof that was just driven by starting and then scaling this firm.At this point we have a\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge number of companies in\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe portfolio and a large number of investments in the works at any point in time. The\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsheer load of the number of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthings coming at me and coming at the senior partners here is just very intense. That\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas forced a comprehensive\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tshift to a far more structured way of living. It&#39;s actually by far the most structured\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI\u2019ve ever been.   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe typical day for me right now is quite literally following the calendar very closely.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI&#39;m trying to have as\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cprogrammed\u201d a day as I possibly can.    Walk me through what a day looks like.  I should start by saying that none of what follows would be possible without the help of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmy amazing and\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindefatigable assistant Arsho Avetian. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe&#39;s been my secret weapon for more than 20\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyears.\n It&#39;s more by week than\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby day. The day of the week determines a lot. Monday and Friday have very specific\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tschedules because we run in the\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trhythm of a venture capital firm. There\u2019s an all day sort-of marathon on Monday which is\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen most of the actual\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tteamwork happens. We also use Friday for that.Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays are\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmuch more open ended. Those\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttend to be a lot more outwards-facing and have lots of board meetings, entrepreneur\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcounsels and so on. Running\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMonday through Friday in this kind of regimented schedule, I do now finally understand\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhy people have the concept\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof a weekend.I&#39;m trying my best to preserve Saturday and Sunday for at least a little\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbit of downtime.\n      In your old post you talked about Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s open calendar and the\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tupside of having unstructured\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime in your day and the flexibility you get with that.\n  When Arnold did that interview I think he was in \u2018entrepreneur mode\u2019. At the time he was\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tengaged in lots of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentrepreneurial projects and starting lots of new businesses. I think there&#39;s certainly\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvirtue to that if you&#39;re an\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentrepreneur in heavy creation mode.\n  I lived a fair amount like that earlier in my career when I was programming. Basically\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tworking on exactly one thing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall the time until you&#39;re exhausted and collapse. And then get up the next morning and\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twork on that thing some more.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI never really had a calendar. I just knew what I was working on. In a sense, that\u2019s the\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsame as having no\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tschedule.The challenge obviously shows up when you&#39;re trying to do anything that\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvolves either running an\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\torganization or being in a customer service role. That is how we think about parts of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat we do now. If part of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyour job is to deal with a large amount of incoming, you actually need to respond in a\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttimely manner and not let\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople down. Maybe some people can do that off the cuff. I don&#39;t know how to do\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat.\n  Was there a moment when you decided to change your old system? Was it when you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfounded the\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfirm?\n  Yeah, honestly, when we started the firm in 2009 we just got right into it. It was just\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta hurricane of new activity.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe had decided one of the values of the firm is respect for the people we work with. And\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpart of that respect is -\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe don&#39;t drop balls. We respond quickly and we have SLAs on getting back to people in a\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspecific period of time. We\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tuse the old JP Morgan saying of \u201cfirst class business in a first class way\u201d. If you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontact us, you&#39;re going to get\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta response. If we commit to doing something, we&#39;re going to do that thing. It was just a\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnecessity to be able to\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave some sort of system.\n  Venture capital, I think, is very \u2018close to the ground\u2019 work.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe VCs who have tried to\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabstract themselves from the day to day have not done well. You have to really know\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat&#39;s going on. You have to\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treally be in close touch with what&#39;s happening in these markets and with these\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttechnologies and where these\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentrepreneurs are. And you have to be talking to a lot of people all the time, right? It\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjust necessitates a more\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstructured approach.\n  You&#39;re waking up on Monday morning, or on a Sunday night, you&#39;re looking at this\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[[your calendar]], what are\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou thinking?\n  I\u2019m thinking \u201cGod, I\u2019m organized! I have a plan!\u201d. If I didn\u2019t have this, I\u2019d be in a\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpanic the very first moment I\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twake up.\n  The big thing is basically *everything* is on the calendar. Sleep is on the\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcalendar, going to bed is in there\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand so is free time. Free time is critical because that&#39;s the release valve. You can\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twork full tilt for a long time\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tas long as you know you have actual time for yourself coming up. I find if you don&#39;t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tschedule enough free time, you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tget resentful of your own calendar. When I was younger, I didn&#39;t really have the concept\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof turning off. But there\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcomes a time, a little bit with age, when your body rebels. And obviously, if you have a\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfamily, that\u2019s not great\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith a system where you&#39;re just always working.\n    One of the things I find interesting about your calendar is that there is a lot of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tallocated open space. We&#39;ve\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toften spoken about how some of the most interesting, influential people in the\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tworld tend to have large chunks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof open space. As opposed to executives who are scheduled for every 30 minutes\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tback to back from 8am to\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7pm.\n  You know, we\u2019ve both worked with executives where they were scheduled to the \u2018nth\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdegree. The three things you tend to\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnotice with executives like that.\n  ...It&#39;s like those classic movie scenes when there&#39;s a huge crisis and somebody calls out to their secretary \u201cCancel my schedule!\u201d...\n  One, they just never have any time to actually think. And that turns out to be a\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfairly important thing. Two,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey have a hard time adjusting to changes in circumstances. In our business of venture\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcapital, you get a lot of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproblems that come up. There is a lot of firefighting. It&#39;s like those classic movie\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tscenes when there&#39;s a huge crisis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand somebody calls out to their secretary \u201cCancel my schedule!\u201d. Well, maybe you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twouldn\u2019t need to do that if you had\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome flexibility in your calendar.\n  Then the other thing you\u2019ve probably seen is the managers who are regimented to that\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdegree end up being micro managers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou\u2019ve probably seen examples of this where some of these folks end up in the weeds on\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\teverything. The good news is\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey&#39;ve got the pulse of everything happening in the organization. The bad news is\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey\u2019ve become the bottleneck. The\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\textreme form - and I&#39;ve worked with a couple of people like this - end up having a long\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tline outside their office. The\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlines will stretch  waaaay down the hallway with people waiting to get in and see\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthem. They kind of bottleneck\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyour organization too. It&#39;s demoralizing to work in an organization like that because\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbasically, whatever that is, it\u2019s\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe opposite of delegation.\n  A related topic is delegation. For a lot of those folks, it&#39;s hard to let go.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDelegation can often be a platitude.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt\u2019s easy to talk about but in practice a lot of people struggle with it. So\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen you want to clear up open\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspace on your calendar, how do you do it? How do you *actually* say, \u201cI am not\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoing to do this\u201d, \u201cI&#39;m going to\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsay no\u201d, or \u201cI&#39;m going to have someone else do this\u201d\n  Yeah, well, the good news is because of the way I run things, I don&#39;t directly manage\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanybody.\n  You&#39;re a very unusual person for me to do these sets of interviews with because\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyou&#39;re not a traditional CEO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trunning a huge organization.\n  That&#39;s right. So that&#39;s necessarily going to be different, at least to some degree. I\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdon&#39;t have the pressure of all of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe one on ones, all the management responsibilities. I&#39;m involved in a fair amount of\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmanagement stuff for the firm but\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit&#39;s stuff that we cover in our internal meetings. And then we&#39;ve got all these\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tincredible people to manage all these\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tteams.What we all kind of have to do at some point is to figure out how to just say no\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand triage the incoming.\n  Which may be good segue to these text files that you sent me a screenshot of.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEvery executive has to have their\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\town check-in system. You have finite time and you have a bunch of projects you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcare about that you need to keep\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tan eye on. What\u2019s your system to make this work?\n      So basically, there&#39;s two kinds of projects. Apple has this concept they call the\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdirectly responsible individual - the\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tD-R-I. For any project, I\u2019ve tried to identify the DRI. Who is the person responsible\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor delivering the project? If\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat&#39;s me, then the project itself gets on my calendar. If it doesn&#39;t go on the\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcalendar, it is not getting done. The\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tweekly check in is for all the projects other people are responsible for. As an\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\texample,you could have a company raising\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoney or going through a big transaction. I don&#39;t want to hound the entrepreneur or the\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCEO every day necessarily but at\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleast want to stay up-to-date on a frequent basis, right? I never want these things to\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tjust go dark where you\u2019re going\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u201cWhatever happened to that?\u201d\n       I want to zoom out just a little bit. Talk to me about a longer time horizon,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsay at a yearly level. Is there\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta week where you&#39;re off meditating on top of a mountain and saying \u201cWell, this\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyear I need to spend more\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime with founders\u201d or \u201cThis year I need to spend more time reading scientific\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpapers\u201d or some such\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tallocation.\n And tied to that, how do you connect your goals and the firm&#39;s goals to how you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspend your\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime and attention?   Is there a mountain top?", "posttime": "2020-06-14 11:57:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6548\u5e94,effect,\u65f6\u95f4", "title": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u9a6c\u514b\u00b7\u5b89\u5fb7\u68ee(Marc Andreessen)", "title_en": "The Observer Effect: Marc Andreessen", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theobservereffect.org/marc.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6548\u5e94", "effect", "\u65f6\u95f4"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1006493, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "2019\u5e749\u6708\uff0c\u6211\u53c2\u52a0\u4e86\u8482\u4e9a\u6208\u00b7\u798f\u7279(Tiago Forte)\u5f00\u8bbe\u7684\u4e00\u95e8\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u6784\u5efa\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5927\u8111\u201d\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3002\n\u542c\u8d77\u6765\u5f88\u50cf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5927\u8111\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf-\u5728\u4f60\u8eab\u4f53\u7684\u76ae\u80a4\u548c\u9aa8\u9abc\u754c\u9650\u4e4b\u5916-\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3001\u6d88\u5316\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u826f\u597d\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\n\u5c31\u50cf\u4efb\u4f55\u96c6\u6210\u5f97\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u60a8\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5c0f\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u7231\u7684\u5c0f\u95ed\u73af--\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u8bba\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u90fd\u56f4\u7ed5\u7740\u6211\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5927\u8111\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6587\u7ae0\u3001\u4e66\u7c4d\u3001\u8bba\u6587\u3001\u64ad\u5ba2\u548c\u534a\u6210\u54c1\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u3002\u5b83\u4eec\u5f62\u6210\u7b14\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\u800c\u53d1\u5c55-\u5b83\u4eec\u5408\u5e76\u3001\u66f2\u6298\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u719f\u4e3a\u6f14\u8bb2\u3001\u535a\u5ba2\u5e16\u5b50\u548c\u63d2\u56fe\u3002\u5f88\u96be\u8bb0\u4f4f\u6ca1\u6709\u5b83\u6211\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u5b50\u3002\n\u6211\u76ee\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u662froam Research\uff0c\u7531\u952e\u76d8\u5927\u5e08(Keyboard Maestro)\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e9b\u5947\u7279\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\u8981\u6e05\u695a\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u9644\u5c5e\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u56de\u6263\u3002\u6211\u4e0d\u4f1a\u56e0\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8fd9\u95e8\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bf4\u597d\u8bdd\u800c\u62ff\u94b1\u3002\n\u8482\u4e9a\u6208\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u90fd\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u3002\u4ed6\u4ee5\u4e00\u79cd\u5728Insta-Internet\u4e0a\u96be\u5f97\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u6bcf\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\u3002\n\u5e0c\u671b\u5b83\u80fd\u8ba9\u4f60\u5bf9BASB\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u3002\u8482\u4e9a\u6208\u7684Forte Labs\u535a\u5ba2\u4e0a\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u503c\u5f97\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u4ed6\u5f88\u64c5\u957f\u53d1\u63a8\u7279\u3002", "note_en": "In September of 2019 I took a course called   Building a Second Brain by   Tiago Forte.\n Much like it sounds, Building a Second Brain is about creating a reliable system \u2013 outside your physical skin-and-bone bodily boundaries \u2013 for storing, organising, digesting, and eventually transforming information into Good Creative Output.\n Much like any well-integrated tool, the mental distance between you and the system grows small. It&#39;s a lovely little closed feedback loop \u2013   a cybernetic system. At this point almost all of my daily workflow revolves around my second brain. as, articles, books, papers, podcasts, and half-formed thoughts go in. These build into notes and develop over time \u2013 they merge, meander, and mature into talks and blog posts and illustrations.
