Shares were down 47% by 06:40 ET.\n It added that the delay in getting its accounts signed off by EY could mean loans of around 2 billion euros would be called in early this week.\n Wirecard shares plunged more than 60% on Thursday as the German payments giant postponed its annual results once again and said auditors could not confirm the existence of 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in cash on its balance sheet.\n The Munich-headquartered company said in a  statement Thursday morning that auditor EY couldn&#39;t find the cash balances\u00a0\u2014 which represent roughly a quarter of its balance sheet. There were indications that &#34;spurious balance confirmations&#34; had been made by a trustee to &#34;deceive the auditor\u00a0and create a wrong perception of the existence of such cash balances,&#34; it added.\n  &#34;The Wirecard management board is working intensively together with the auditor towards a clarification of the situation,&#34; the firm said. It added that the delay in getting its accounts signed off by EY could mean loans of around 2 billion euros would be called in early this week.\n Wirecard&#39;s share price cratered immediately after the news, and was trading almost 64% lower by 8:40 a.m. ET.\n The embattled group has fallen from its position as  one of Germany&#39;s top financial technology darlings to a company mired in controversy due to  allegations of fraud. The firm was at one point last year worth more than 24 billion euros and even replaced Commerzbank in the German blue-chip index, but has since seen its market capitalization decline to just 6.5 billion euros\n The Financial Times has published a series of reports on its investigation into Wirecard&#39;s accounting practices. According to those reports, which began back in January 2019, Wirecard&#39;s Singapore office tried to inflate revenue through forged and backdated contracts. Another story in October claimed that Wirecard&#39;s staff appeared to conspire to inflate sales and profits at subsidiaries in Dubai and Dublin and mislead EY.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 22:38:13",

"note_en": "Executives and engineers from Facebook\u2019s games division submitted their new app,  Facebook Gaming, to Apple last month for approval to offer it in the iPhone maker\u2019s App Store.\n Apple considered Facebook\u2019s application for a few weeks. This month, it delivered its verdict: denied.\n The Facebook team was not surprised. It wasn\u2019t the first time Apple had said no to the Facebook Gaming app. Or the second. Or even the third.\n Since February, Apple has rejected at least five versions of Facebook Gaming, according to three people with knowledge of the companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Each time, the people said, Apple cited its rules that prohibit apps with the \u201cmain purpose\u201d of distributing casual games.\n Facebook Gaming may also have been hurt by appearing to compete with Apple\u2019s own sales of games, two of the people said. Games are by far the most lucrative category of mobile apps worldwide. Apple\u2019s App Store, the only officially approved place for iPhone and iPad users to find new games and other programs, generated about $15 billion in revenue last year.\n Apple\u2019s rejections of the app from Facebook, a fellow Silicon Valley powerhouse, illustrate the control it exerts over the mobile software and entertainment ecosystem \u2014 clout that regulators are increasingly examining. On Tuesday, the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, said it had  opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple to determine if the terms that the company imposes on app developers violate competition rules.\n \u201cWe need to ensure that Apple\u2019s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in charge of competition policy.\n This week, Basecamp publicly complained that its  new email app, Hey, had been denied from the App Store because it charged customers outside Apple\u2019s payment system, keeping the giant company from collecting its 30 percent cut.\n \u201cWe keep trying to find logic, consistency in Apple\u2019s App Store decisions,\u201d David Hansson, Basecamp\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer,  wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe answer is much more basic: power. Apple can do what they want, when they want, so they do.\u201d\n Mr. Hansson added that the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division had contacted him earlier to talk about Apple.\n  Apple, which will hold its annual developer conference next week, said the App Store has many apps that offer casual games and that follow its rules, including the main Facebook app.\n  Apple has long taken a \u201c walled garden\u201d approach to its mobile devices while its main mobile competitor, Google and its Android operating system, has adopted a more laissez-faire philosophy. Both companies take 30 percent of most purchases on their app stores, leaving 70 percent to app developers.\n \u201cApple and Google Play have always pursued different strategies for their app stores, which align with the closed ecosystem \u2014 Apple \u2014 versus open ecosystem \u2014 Google \u2014 company attributes,\u201d said Candice Mudrick, head of market analysis at Newzoo, a game industry research firm.\n Apple has said it monitors its App Store ecosystem closely to ensure the highest standards of quality and security. According to its  App Store principles: \u201cWhen you download an app, it should work as promised. We carefully review each app and require developers to follow strict guidelines on privacy, design and business models.\u201d\n But over time, that has increasingly grated on some app developers. The European Union investigation into Apple was spurred by a  complaint last year from Spotify, whose music-streaming service competes with Apple Music. Spotify and others have criticized Apple for charging a fee of up to 30 percent on digital services sold through its App Store, arguing that it amounts to a tax that violates competition laws.\n Facebook announced its Gaming app in April as people were sheltering in place from the coronavirus pandemic and playing more video games. For the social network, the new app was a way to more deeply engage its users.\n The free app has three main components: watching live streams of other people playing games; socially networking with other gamers; and playing simple games like Words With Friends and Thug Life. On both Apple and Android devices, those simple games can be delivered within Facebook Gaming\u2019s app using software called HTML5.\n  Google quickly approved Facebook Gaming for its Google Play app store and began  offering the app worldwide on April 20. In the Android version of Facebook Gaming, a catalog of simple games is presented by category and with colorful icons. Some of those games allow players to spend real money for in-game purchases.\n Facebook initially submitted its Gaming app to Apple for approval in late February, said the people with knowledge of the situation. Apple rejected that version, they said, citing  Section 4.7 of its app rules, which state that HTML5 games are allowed \u201cas long as code distribution isn\u2019t the main purpose of the app\u201d and \u201cthe code is not offered in a store or store-like interface,\u201d among other restrictions.\n But the initial version of the Gaming app that Facebook showed to Apple was similar to the Android version, listing games by category in a manner that could be interpreted as \u201cstore-like.\u201d\n Trying to get the Gaming app through Apple\u2019s review process, Facebook then changed the design of the presentation of games in several ways, the people said. The colorful icons were removed in favor of a bland listing. The different games categories were removed to list all games at once. The ability to sort games was also taken away.\n Facebook also included a version that looked almost exactly like how such games are presented already within the main Facebook app on Apple devices, which is a single unalphabetized, unsortable list, the people said.\n  In Facebook\u2019s most recent submission, the Gaming app did not include a separate tab for playable games and included no way for the user to choose from a wide selection of games to play, the people said. Instead, that version suggested certain games within the user\u2019s news and activity feed.\n  Since then, Facebook has been weighing its next move. The company is considering releasing Facebook Gaming on Apple devices without playable games at all, the people with knowledge of the social network said. Another option, they said, is continuing to make playable games even more difficult for users to find within the app.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 22:19:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A newly discovered spyware effort attacked users through 32 million downloads of extensions to Google\u2019s market-leading Chrome web browser, researchers at Awake Security told Reuters, highlighting the tech industry\u2019s failure to protect browsers as they are used more for email, payroll and other sensitive functions.\n Alphabet Inc\u2019s (  GOOGL.O) Google said it removed more than 70 of the malicious add-ons from its official Chrome Web Store after being alerted by the researchers last month.\n \u201cWhen we are alerted of extensions in the Web Store that violate our policies, we take action and use those incidents as training material to improve our automated and manual analyses,\u201d Google spokesman Scott Westover told Reuters.\n Most of the free extensions purported to warn users about questionable websites or convert files from one format to another. Instead, they siphoned off browsing history and data that provided credentials for access to internal business tools.\n Based on the number of downloads, it was the most far-reaching malicious Chrome store campaign to date, according to Awake co-founder and chief scientist Gary Golomb.\n Google declined to discuss how the latest spyware compared with prior campaigns, the breadth of the damage, or why it did not detect and remove the bad extensions on its own despite past promises to supervise offerings more closely.\n It is unclear who was behind the effort to distribute the malware. Awake said the developers supplied fake contact information when they submitted the extensions to Google.\n \u201cAnything that gets you into somebody\u2019s browser or email or other sensitive areas would be a target for national espionage as well as organized crime,\u201d said former National Security Agency engineer Ben Johnson, who founded security companies Carbon Black and Obsidian Security.\n The extensions were designed to avoid detection by antivirus companies or security software that evaluates the reputations of web domains, Golomb said.\n If someone used the browser to surf the web on a home computer, it would connect to a series of websites and transmit information, the researchers found. Anyone using a corporate network, which would include security services, would not transmit the sensitive information or even reach the malicious versions of the websites.\n \u201cThis shows how attackers can use extremely simple methods to hide, in this case, thousands of malicious domains,\u201d Golomb said.\n All of the domains in question, more than 15,000 linked to each other in total, were purchased from a small registrar in Israel, Galcomm, known formally as CommuniGal Communication Ltd.\n  In an email exchange, Galcomm owner Moshe Fogel told Reuters that his company had done nothing wrong.\n \u201cGalcomm is not involved, and not in complicity with any malicious activity whatsoever,\u201d Fogel wrote. \u201cYou can say exactly the opposite, we cooperate with law enforcement and security bodies to prevent as much as we can.\u201d\n Fogel said there was no record of the inquiries Golomb said he made in April and again in May to the company\u2019s email address for reporting abusive behavior, and he asked for a list of suspect domains. Reuters sent him that list three times without getting a substantive response.\n The Internet Corp for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees registrars, said it had received few complaints about Galcomm over the years, and none about malware.\n While deceptive extensions have been a problem for years, they are getting worse. They initially spewed unwanted advertisements, and now are more likely to install additional malicious programs or track where users are and what they are doing for government or commercial spies.\n  Malicious developers have been using Google\u2019s Chrome Store as a conduit for a long time. After one in 10 submissions was deemed malicious, Google said in 2018  here it would improve security, in part by increasing human review.\n But in February, independent researcher Jamila Kaya and Cisco Systems\u2019 Duo Security uncovered  here a similar Chrome campaign that stole data from about 1.7 million users. Google joined the investigation and found 500 fraudulent extensions.\n \u201cWe do regular sweeps to find extensions using similar techniques, code and behaviors,\u201d Google\u2019s Westover said, in identical language to what Google gave out after Duo\u2019s report.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 22:01:48", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "Project Mercury was literally having trouble getting off the ground. In Augustof 1960, after the first Mercury-Atlas exploded in flight, the major journal inthe aerospace business,  Missiles and Rockets, stated: &#34;NASA&#39;s Mercurymanned satellite program appears to be plummeting the United States toward a newhumiliating disaster in the East-West space race. The program is more than oneyear behind the original schedule and is expected to slip to two. It no longeroffers any realistic hope of beating Russia in launching the first man intoorbit, much less to serve as an early stepping-stone for reaching the Moon.&#34; The testing of the Mercury capsule escape system was carried out at the WallopsIsland Station just below the Maryland-Virginia border. This was a Langley testfacility for all sorts of &#34;sounding,&#34; or high-altitude research rockets. Thetests of the escape system were about 50 percent successful. While we weregetting ready at the Cape, one of the Mercury tests at Wallops failedspectacularly on November 8. Sixteen seconds after launch the escape andjettison rockets fired prematurely, thus leaving the capsule attached to thebooster rocket, which reached a ten-mile apex and then came screaming back toEarth, destroying the capsule at impact. The Mercury program used two booster rockets \u2014 the Redstone and the Atlas. Bothwere derivatives of military systems but with vastly different capabilities. TheRedstone was an Army battlefield rocket. It would be used to start the capsulesystems qualification test flight and, if that was successful, for two ballisticmanned missions. The ballistic missions were to be about twenty minutes induration, reaching a maximum altitude of about 130 miles and providing a shortweightless period before reentry. The Atlas was an Air Force intercontinentalmissile and was to be used for both ballistic and orbital Mercury missions. Thefirst three missions were ballistic, to continue the booster and capsulequalification, test the tracking network, and provide experience for the MCCteam. The orbital testing would continue the qualification testing using themechanical man and a chimpanzee before the manned orbital flights. When Mercury-Atlas 1 exploded in flight, we fell about one year behind in theschedule, so a lot was riding on the first Mercury-Redstone flight, MR-1.Kraft&#39;s team arrived on November 13 for the MR-1 launch, now only eight daysaway. Once again my guardian angel, Johnson, arrived to save my bacon. He took aplace to the right of the console and punched up the buttons of the intercomduring our simulation dress rehearsal. Immediately, a half dozen different conversations flooded through my headset. Itreminded me of the cool, almost casual but terse and clear voice chatter thatcame up on the tactical frequency when things heated up during the time I was inKorea directing air strikes on ground targets. As I listened, I picked up thevoices of the test conductors. Johnson broke out some thick documents andadvised Kraft of the page and sequence of the countdown. It was fortunate thatthis was just a test. It gave Johnson a chance to brief me on the countdownprocess, get to know the people talking on the loops and Mercury Control&#39;s rolein the test. At intervals, Johnson encouraged me as the MCC procedures controller to makesuggestions to Kraft or one of the other controllers. Throughout the test, heglanced around the room and made mental notes about what people at the variousconsole positions should be doing or doing in a different way. Periodically, Iwould print out a message and call the ground communications controller.Eshelman would rush into the room to pick up the message, put it on the Teletypeline, and then rush back with a confirming copy of the transmitted text. Afterseveral hours, I picked up the routine of the count and felt comfortable, aslong as all was going well. This first mission in which I would play a role was a ballistic test of aRedstone booster rocket and a Mercury capsule. The Redstone&#39;s engine wasscheduled to burn for two and one half minutes. After the booster engine cutoff, the escape tower separated from the capsule by firing the tower ringattachment bolts and igniting the tower escape rocket. Then after the boosterthrust had decayed, explosive bolts would fire, followed by the firing of threesmall posigrade solid rockets, to separate the capsule from the booster.(&#34;Posigrade&#34; is the term used for adding velocity in the direction of flight, inthis instance the small rockets used to separate the Mercury capsule from thebooster. Retrograde rockets fire opposite to the direction of flight.) TheRedstone boosted the spacecraft to an altitude of 130 miles before it started toarc downward. At 20,000 feet, the capsule&#39;s drogue parachutes would deploy, stabilize itsmotion, and slow it down sufficiently to allow the main parachutes to deploysafely. Then the landing sequence would begin. The entire mission was planned tolast only sixteen minutes. After the countdown simulation test we began trainingfor the brief actual flight of the Redstone. For three days we rehearsed,calling out events and issuing backup commands to the automatic sequences. During the simulation run-through our instructors sat watching us from theirvantage point at the top row of the consoles and played magnetic tapes into thetelemetry and radar systems, which in turn drove the controller&#39;s meters andplot board displays. If all else failed, we would be handed a written question,like a pop quiz in school. You had to stand up in front of the entire MissionControl Center team and say, &#34;Flight! A new problem has shown up and this iswhat I am going to do about it.&#34; You took it seriously. God help you if youcouldn&#39;t come up with an answer \u2014 instantly. The launch complex from which we would fire the Redstone consisted of the launchpad, service tower, and a blockhouse for launch site command and control.Servicing the pad was a network of power and communications cables, and pipescarrying fuel and other fluids. The blockhouses were igloolike structures thatsat about 230 meters from the pad and looked somewhat like squat World War IIpillboxes. Atlas blockhouses were a bit different \u2014 twelve-sided concretebunkers with walls three meters thick and domed tops, embedded in thirteenmeters of sand. Earlier blockhouses used a viewing slit with a thickquartz/glass window. Later on periscopes were added; they afforded a view ofsuch things as the fuel tanks and cable trenches. The blockhouses had to beclose enough for direct viewing and far enough from the booster to survive anexplosion. (Five percent of the early boosters exploded shortly after liftoff.) The blockhouse team was a mixture of German rocket scientists, former Armytechnicians, and booster contractors. The Germans were most often found talkingin their native language, huddled over their displays and praying for things togo right. In addition to von Braun&#39;s colleagues, the blockhouse capsuleengineers were drawn from a broad talent pool, mostly from aircraft (soon to becalled aerospace) contractors. Kraft&#39;s team was made up of engineers who camefrom all sorts of backgrounds, put together like a pickup softball team. Thecapsule engineers came from the NASA Space Task Group, network controllers fromthe Air Force, facility technicians from Bendix, and the Mercury Control CenterCapComs from the initial group of seven astronauts. Three-man operations teamswere deployed to the thirteen Project Mercury manned tracking stations toprovide global tracking, data, and voice communications data coverage. Theleader of the three-man team was the CapCom, and he was responsible for sitemission readiness, real-time mission support, and status reporting to theMercury Control flight director. During the manned missions he provided thecommunications with the astronaut in the capsule, hence the term &#34;CapCom.&#34; The teams at the thirteen manned tracking stations were provided by Kraft&#39;soperations organization. With high-risk time-critical decisions, the astronautcorps believed that only astronauts should talk to the astronaut in the capsule.In the Mercury Control Center and at the blockhouse, CapComs were selected fromthe Mercury astronauts and they were often sent to tracking stations designatedas mission critical. During this period, the American space program drew on some military resourcesas well as those of NASA. By contrast, the Russian program was part of theirmilitary. Soviet hardware, software, and personnel were military, albeit withsome modification \u2014 spacecraft instead of warheads sitting on top of boostersthat, like our Atlas, originated in military programs developed for strategicwarfare. Over time the Russian effort would become somewhat more civilian innature, but from inception, NASA&#39;s operations would be separated by a kind offirewall from military operations and personnel. In the first decades of the race into space the Russians enjoyed the advantagesof running a program powered by the virtually unrestricted resources and fundingof a military that, in a command economy, came first in economic priority. Wewere on a somewhat more modest footing in the early days. That would changedramatically thanks to President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Johnsonpushing for the funding and resources that would enable an explicitly civilianspace program to succeed. In Mercury Control the only controllers reporting administratively to ChrisKraft were the trajectory operators, Tecwyn (Tec) Roberts, and Carl Huss, whom Ihad yet to meet; Howard Kyle, who doubled for Kraft at the flight directorconsole; Paul Johnson; and myself. The capsule engineers assigned to work withthe MCC team understandably focused on hardware rather than flight operationsand had their hands full checking out the spacecraft in Hangar S, and theylooked at training in the Mercury Control Center as a waste of their time. Thecore of the engineering staff was based at Space Task Group headquarters atLangley Research Center. When McDonnell Aircraft sent a capsule to the Cape theengineers would come down and check it out in Hangar S. Despite a certain amount of confusion about who should be doing what, since wewere inventing it all as we went along, we were moving quickly to the crunchpoint. To my dismay, two days before launch at the readiness review, Johnsontook me aside and said he would not be there. He had to go to the Canary Islandsto work out a tracking site problem. He wished me good luck. November 21, 1960, Mercury-Redstone 1 Only one month and four days after I was hired, I was at the procedures console.Thanks to Johnson&#39;s unflagging coaching and the training we had done, I had noproblems and felt comfortable with the mechanics. But I had a long way to gobefore I would have that sense of &#34;being ahead of the airplane&#34; or &#34;ahead of thepower curve&#34; as pilots put it \u2014 having the experience to anticipate what could happen rather than just reacting to what was happening at themoment. As the countdown proceeded, I noticed a change in the intensity of theatmosphere in the control room. I had felt that before when I signed off myaircraft \u2014 accepted it as ready for flight \u2014 at Holloman. Although the job wasdifferent, the emotional content was the same. Controllers were going throughthe same gut churning as we had had prior to a B-52 test flight. During a holdin the countdown to fix a leak in the Redstone&#39;s hydrogen peroxide system thatfueled the control thrusters, Kraft turned to me and said, &#34;How about getting mea couple of cartons of milk from the roach coach?&#34; (Mercury Control, like allthe other Cape facilities, was out in a vast palmetto swamp, about half a mileoff the main road. A lunch wagon, known as the roach coach, pulled by a pickuptruck, made its rounds to the test stands, camera trackers, and other stations.The loudspeakers would announce its arrival when it stopped at Mercury Controlthree times each day. The menu was pretty limited \u2014 but it did offer milk.) Forthe first time I realized that behind Kraft&#39;s calm exterior he had the samesensations I felt \u2014 of squirrels running around in my stomach \u2014 as weapproached launch. The launch countdown progressed without any major incident. As liftoffapproached, I leaned back and peered at the video image on Kraft&#39;s consolecoming from a camera focused on the Redstone standing on the launch pad.Precisely at zero on the clock, there was a great cloud of smoke. Kraft lookedstartled, and then he leaned forward intently. The TV cameraman momentarily losttrack as he panned the camera upward, and, for a few seconds, there was nothingon the screen but a smoky sky. From my position, it looked much like the rocketsI had launched from aircraft. I was surprised at how quickly the Redstone hadaccelerated and moved out of sight. Then after a few seconds the camera panned down. Although smoke still obscuredthe launch pad, the vague outline of the Redstone was still there. Kraft&#39;s facewas incredulous. He stammered for a few seconds, then called out, &#34;Booster, whatthe hell happened?&#34; Our booster engineer in the control room came from the Marshall Redstone team.After liftoff he was responsible for reporting booster status \u2014 engine andguidance \u2014 to Kraft&#39;s team. If something was wrong he was supposed to give us aheads-up so the trajectory people in Mercury Control could better assess whatthey were seeing on their radar plot boards. Now he reverted to his nativeGerman as he tried to figure out what happened and, more importantly, what theblockhouse team should do about it. All hell broke loose. The Redstone hadlifted a few inches off the launch pad and then the engine shut down. By somemiracle, the rocket had landed back on the launcher cradle. When the escape tower cut loose, unguided and spewing flame, it corkscrewed toan altitude of about 4,000 feet. As it plummeted back to Earth, loudspeakersaround the facility blared out warnings to the astronauts, engineers, and VIPsin the viewing area to take cover. The escape tower ultimately landed some 1,200feet from the launch pad. The launch team in the blockhouse was as stunned as Mercury Control. Boostercontinued talking in German to his counterparts in the blockhouse, oblivious toKraft&#39;s repeated calls. Television cameras showed the events on the pad as themain and reserve landing parachutes popped out of their stowage compartment atthe nose of the capsule, ejected upward and partially opened up. Initially, theyhung limply, then they slowly inflated and caught the sea breeze. At the sametime strips of tinfoil were ejected from the capsule and spilled over the sidesof the booster and capsule. (The strips, or chaff, were used to help radar trackthe capsule as it was slowed down by the parachute and headed for splashdown, orwater landing, in the Atlantic Ocean.) Every controller held his breath, afraidthe parachute would topple the rocket and cause an explosion. The intercom that had been quiet was now busily filled with directions,observations, and opinions. Everything that happened, although it had taken onlyseconds, passed before me in slow motion. Then it finally clicked.  We hadlaunched the escape tower. The Redstone rocket, surrounded by smoke, was armed and fueled but still sittingon the launch pad. Kraft told everyone to calm down, but Booster was still onthe hot line, interrogating the blockhouse in German. We all could see the angerglowing in Kraft&#39;s eyes as he walked over and yanked Booster&#39;s headset cordloose from the console, saying, &#34;Speak to  me, dammit!&#34; Chaos continued for several minutes until Booster, in halting English, told usthat the Redstone engines had fired and the rocket had lifted off the pad enoughto drop the umbilical, the bundle of cables that connected launch control withthe booster and that normally fell away right after liftoff. Then the engineinexplicably shut down. The Mercury capsule, sensing the booster&#39;s engineshutdown, acted as if it were in orbit and sent the command to jettison theescape tower. The capsule, not sensing any further acceleration, acted as if itwere in the recovery phase and so deployed the parachutes. We now had a liverocket on the pad, a fully pressurized Redstone; and, since the umbilicals haddisconnected, we had no control of it. The booster&#39;s destruct system was armedand there was no way to secure the system. No one had any idea what to do next. Kraft walked over to me, eyes blazing. Pointing at Booster he snapped, &#34;The damnGermans still haven&#39;t learned who they work for. Everyone in this control roommust work for me.&#34; We sat stunned, helpless in Mercury Control. We had notechnical data on the spacecraft or the launch system beyond a simple manual,the equivalent of an owner&#39;s manual for a new car. All of us were still thinkingin aircraft, not rocket, terms \u2014 and we were definitely behind the power curve.We had no data to work with because we weren&#39;t smart enough to know what wereally needed. We were dealing with a  new control room, a  newnetwork,  new procedures, and entirely  new jobs, doing somethingthat we had never done before, something almost alien to our nature. A tentative proposal came from the blockhouse to reconnect the umbilical. Thechances of people getting killed doing this were discussed and we decided thatit could not be done safely. The next, and equally desperate, suggestion was toget a cherry picker (a kind of crane or boom with a man-holding bucket on theend of it, like those used by telephone and utility line repair crews) and cutthe nylon parachute risers. This would at least eliminate the threat of windfilling the parachute and toppling the Redstone, but this idea was alsodiscarded because of the risk to personnel. All the while we were apprehensivelywatching a partially inflated parachute and praying that the sea breeze did notpick up, fill the parachute, and topple the whole damn rocket over. After impatiently listening to a pretty far-out proposal to depressurize therocket by using a rifle to shoot holes in the fuel and oxidizer tanks, Kraftsputtered and growled, &#34;Dammit, that&#39;s no way to do it! They sound like a bunchthat just started spring training!&#34; Even to a rookie like me, shooting a hole inthe tanks did not seem to be a sound plan. Kraft listened intently as each of the crazy schemes came across the loops,everybody desperately searching for a way out. Then one of the test conductorscame up with a plan that made sense. &#34;The winds are forecast to remain calm, soif we wait until tomorrow morning, the batteries will deplete, the relays andvalves will go to the normally open condition. As the oxidizer warms up, thetank vents will open, removing the flight pressure. With the boosterdepressurized and batteries depleted, it will then be safe to approach therocket.&#34; Kraft nodded and growled at his controllers, &#34;That is the first rule of flightcontrol. If you don&#39;t know what to do,  don&#39;t do anything!&#34; We securedMercury Control and the blockhouse gang got saddled with the unenviable job ofnervously watching over the Redstone throughout the night. &#34;Doing nothing&#34;worked: by early the next morning, the batteries were depleted, the destructsystem disarmed, and the pressure relieved. The capsule and the Redstone rockethad survived with only minor damages to the tail fins. This fiasco was the most embarrassing episode yet for the young engineers of theMercury program. The history books call this mission, sardonically butaccurately, &#34;The Four-Inch Flight.&#34; While the badly shaken booster engineersfrantically worked on finding out just what had happened, I promised myself thatwhen I returned to Langley I would use the same technique that had worked for meflying airplanes or flight-testing at Holloman. I would get to know as manytechnici\n......", "posttime": "2020-06-18 22:00:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u82f1\u5bf8,option,\u6d4b\u8bd5",

"note_en": "Yesterday talks between the EU and the US on a digital services tax broke down after U.S. treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, walked out \u2014 saying they\u2019d failed to make any progress, per  Reuters.\n The EU has been eyeing  levying a tax of between 2% and 6% on the local revenues of platform giants.\n  Today the European Commission dug in in response to the US move, with commissioner Paolo Gentiloni reiterating the need for \u201cone digital tax\u201d to adapt to what he dubbed \u201cthe reality of the new century\u201d \u2014 and calling for \u201cunderstanding\u201d in the global negotiation.\n However he also repeated the Commission\u2019s warning that it will push ahead alone if necessary, saying that if the US\u2019 decision to quit talks means achieving global consensus impossible it will put \u201ca new European proposal on the table\u201d.\n C\u2019\u00e8 bisogno di una  #DigitalTax adeguata alla realt\u00e0 del nuovo secolo. Serve un\u2019intesa nel negoziato globale. Se lo stop americano la rendesse impossibile, la  @EU_Commission metter\u00e0 sul tavolo una nuova proposta europea.\n Following the break down of talks, France also warned it will go ahead with a digital tax on tech giants this year \u2014 reversing an earlier suspension that had been intended to grease the negotiations.\n The  New York Times reports French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, describing the US walk-out as \u201ca provocation\u201d, and complaining about the country \u201csystematically threatening\u201d allies with sanctions.\n The issue of \u2018fair taxes\u2019 for platforms has been slow burning in Europe for years, with politicians grilling tech execs in public over how little they contribute to national coffers and even  urging the public to boycott services like Amazon (with little success).\n Updating the tax system to account for digital giants is also front and center for  Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s Commission \u2014 which is responding to the widespread regional public anger over how little tech giants pay in relation to the local revenue they generate.\n European Commission president von der Leyen, who took up her mandate at the back end of last year, has said \u201curgent\u201d reform of the tax system is needed \u2014 warning at the start of 2020 that the  European Union   would be prepared to go it alone on \u201ca fair digital tax\u201d if no global accord was reached by the end of this year.\n At the same time, a number of European countries have been pushing ahead with their own proposals to tax big tech \u2014 including the UK, which started  levying a 2% digital services tax on local revenue in April; and France, which has set out a plan to  tax tech giants 3% of their local revenues.\n This gives the Commission another clear reason to act, given its  raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to reduce fragmentation of the EU\u2019s Single Market.\n Although it faces internal challenges on achieving agreement across Member States, given some smaller economies have used low national corporate tax rates to attract inward investment, including from tech giants.\n The US, meanwhile, has not been sitting on its hands as European governments move ahead to set their own platform taxes. The Trump administration has been throwing its weight around \u2014 arguing US companies are being unfairly targeted by the taxes and warning that it could  retaliate with up to 100% tariffs on countries that go ahead. Though it has yet to do so.\n On the digital tax reform issue the US has said it wants a multilateral agreement via the OECD on a  global minimum. And a\u00a0petite  entente cordiale was reached between France and the US  last summer when president Emmanuel Macron agreed the French tech tax would be scraped once the OECD came up with a global fix.\n However with Trump\u2019s negotiators pulling out of international tax talks with the EU the prospect of a global understanding on a very divisive issue looks further away than ever.\n Though the UK said today it remains committed to a global solution, per  Reuters which quotes a treasury spokesman.\n Earlier this month the US also launched a formal investigation into new or proposed digital taxes in the EU, including the UK\u2019s levy and the EU\u2019s proposal, and plans set out by a number of other EU countries, claiming they \u201cunfairly target\u201d U.S. tech companies

"note_en": "Another long night. I was working on my perfect, bug-free program in C, when the predictable thing happened:\n  Oh, well... Maybe I&#39;ll be more lucky taking over the world another night. But then it struck me. My program received a SIGSEGV signal and crashed with &#34;Segmentation Fault&#34; message. Where does the &#34;V&#34; come from?\n Did I read it wrong? Was there a &#34;Segmentation  Vault?&#34;? Or did Linux authors make a mistake? Shouldn&#39;t the signal be named SIGSEGF?\n I asked my colleagues and  David Wragg quickly told me that the signal name stands for &#34;Segmentation Violation&#34;. I guess that makes sense. Long long time ago, computers used to have  memory segmentation. Each memory segment had defined length - called Segment Limit. Accessing data over this limit caused a processor fault. This error code got re-used  by newer systems that used paging. I think the Intel manuals call this error  &#34;Invalid Page Fault&#34;. When it&#39;s triggered it gets reported to the userspace as a SIGSEGV signal. End of story.\n  Martin Levy pointed me to an ancient  Version 6th UNIX documentation on &#34;signal&#34;. This is from around 1978:\n   It seems that userspace parts of the UNIX tree (i.e. /usr/include/signal.h) switched to SIGSEGV fairly early on. But the kernel internals continued to use the name SIGSEG for much longer.\n Looking deeper David found that PDP11 trap vector used wording  &#34;segmentation violation&#34;. This shows up in Research V4 Edition in the UNIX history repo, but it doesn&#39;t mean it was introduced in V4 - it&#39;s just because V4 is the first version with code still available.\n  The file /usr/include/signal.h appears in the tree for Research V7,  with the name SIGSEGV. But the kernel  still called it SIGSEG at the time\n  Here you go. Originally the signal was called SIGSEG. It was subsequently renamed SIGSEGV in the userspace and a bit later - around 1980 - to SIGSEGV on the kernel side. Apparently there are still no Segmentation Vaults found on UNIX systems.\n As for my original crash, I fixed it - of course - by catching the signal and jumping over the offending instruction. On Linux it is totally possible to catch and handle SIGSEGV. With that fix, my code will never again crash. For sure.\n #define _GNU_SOURCE#include &lt;signal.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;ucontext.h&gt;static void sighandler(int signo, siginfo_t *si, void* v_context){ ucontext_t *context = v_context; context-&gt;uc_mcontext.gregs[REG_RIP] += 10;}int *totally_null_pointer = NULL;int main() { struct sigaction psa; psa.sa_sigaction = sighandler; sigaction(SIGSEGV, &amp;psa, NULL); printf(&#34;Before NULL pointer dereference\\n&#34;); *totally_null_pointer = 1; __asm__ __volatile__(&#34;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;&#34;); printf(&#34;After NULL pointer.

"note_en": "Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson\u00a0launched a firestorm of public criticism of Apple after Apple rejected an update to Basecamp&#39;s new email app.\u00a0Hansson&#39;s  tweet thread and the ensuing controversy surfaced days before Apple&#39;s annual developer conference, and amidst news that the European Commission has opened an  antitrust probe of Apple and the App Store.\n The app in question is Hey, an email tool that eschews tradition to offer a better experience for a certain type of user. It requires users to pay a $99 annual subscription fee to access its features and services but offers a free trial period.\n Hey&#39;s 1.0 version was approved for launch on the App Store just this week, but it came under scrutiny at Apple when Basecamp attempted to deliver a 1.0.1 update with bug fixes. As events unfolded, a call and email came from Apple that indicated Hey would have to take steps toward making its subscription available through Apple&#39;s own billing system and in-app-payments platform. Otherwise, the app would be delisted from the store.\n According to Hansson, Apple told Basecamp that Hey violated rule 3.1.1 in the App Store&#39;s review guidelines.\u00a0Here&#39;s the language Apple uses  in those guidelines:\n If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, etc. Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.\n But at first glance, Hey doesn&#39;t break that rule.\u00a0It does not allow users to subscribe within the app. Instead, users must go to Hey&#39;s website to sign up through Basecamp&#39;s own billing\u2014as is the case for many other popular apps like Spotify or Netflix.\u00a0As per Apple&#39;s guidelines, Hey does not have a link or call-to-action directing users to said website.\n This was understandably a source of confusion for the Hey team. Also confusing: the fact that the 1.0.1 update was rejected but not the 1.0 version, even though the update did not change anything related to this issue.\n Though the tweet started the conversation, much of the meat is in a  follow-up article by David Pierce in Protocol, which contains or references statements from both Hansson and Apple. That report fleshes out the details; it appears Apple is also holding Hey to a set of rules that are\u00a0 not included in the public guidelines.\n  Apple told me that its actual mistake was approving the app in the first place, when it didn&#39;t conform to its guidelines. Apple allows these kinds of client apps\u2014where you can&#39;t sign up, only sign in\u2014for business services but not consumer products. That&#39;s why Basecamp, which companies typically pay for, is allowed on the App Store when Hey, which users pay for, isn&#39;t.\n  One other distinction: Apple allows \u201cReader\u201d apps\u2009\u2014\u2009things like Netflix and Kindle and Dropbox, where you\u2019re using the app to access existing subscriptions\u2009\u2014\u2009as long as they don\u2019t offer a way to sign up. But email, messaging, etc. don\u2019t count as Reader apps.\n Many members of the development community have responded to these revelations with outrage, because these distinctions are not stated or clarified in Apple&#39;s App Store review guidelines. Plus, there are numerous examples of apps that defy classification or simply don&#39;t seem to follow these rules, leaving commentators to  ask what the difference really is between say, Dropbox (which doesn&#39;t appear to have this problem) and Hey (which does).\n The outrage also stems from a strongly held and often voiced belief that Apple&#39;s 15 to 30 percent cut of subscriptions revenue gained through its payment system is not justified. For his part, Hansson made it clear Basecamp doesn&#39;t intend to just make the changes Apple has requested. Quoted in The Protocol, he says:\n There is never in a million years a way that I am paying Apple a third of our revenues.\u00a0That is obscene, and it&#39;s criminal, and I will spend every dollar that we have or ever make to burn this down until we get to somewhere better.\n Apple has not yet released any additional statements, but it seems this conflict is not yet over.\n  In his tweet thread, Hansson repeatedly compared Apple to the mob and gangsters, even though Apple has not yet been found to be breaking the law.\u00a0While various players like Spotify have opened complaints, those complaints haven&#39;t been resolved, and there have been no decisive conclusions that what Apple is doing is, in fact, illegal in Europe, the United States, or most other regions.\n It&#39;s difficult to make the case that Apple is a monopoly, because it does have competition, and it holds a minority market share\u2014by an enormous margin\u2014against its main competitor. But the winds of the legality question could shift, pending the results of the EU complaints and investigation.\n Developers have long complained about the &#34;Apple tax&#34;\u2014that revenue cut the company takes from apps in its App Store. To that point, Hansson is  quoted in The Verge comparing Apple&#39;s cut unfavorably with those of credit card companies that handle billing for transactions like this:\n Why is it that credit card processing fees hover in the 1.8-2.8% range, while Apple\u2019s App Store have sat steady at 30% on the high end? Because there\u2019s no competition! And they have a monopoly grip!\n Credit cards, he argues, offer such low fees because they live in a world of fierce competition\u2014never mind the fact that credit cards are largely fungible. And there are more reasons for this difference besides competition. Credit card companies do not offer nearly the breadth of services and support to businesses that Apple does.\u00a0It&#39;s not just about payment infrastructure.\n Apple provides resources and support to developers, including a wide range of APIs and software tools, that are critical to developing iOS and iPadOS apps. It is not possible to create the apps without them. Apple operates a vast editorial operation to curate and highlight apps, which many developers I have spoken with say is vital for discoverability and success on the platform.\u00a0Apple spends a fortune on the research and development of hardware that developers use, like cameras, CPUs, machine-learning processors, GPUs, and more. And yes, it operates a payments system.\n Apple&#39;s defense of its revenue share, when it has offered one, is similar to the defense of corporate taxes by a national government, which most people support: the earnings of a business are only possible because of the government&#39;s support and diligence in providing security, regulations, multiple forms of basic infrastructure, and so on, so it is reasonable for that business to pay a significant sum in taxes.\n That&#39;s what Apple offers to developers. It&#39;s also worth considering the investment that went into the platform to begin with.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 20:28:48", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

"note_en": "Construction is beginning on the world\u2019s largest liquid air battery, which will store renewable electricity and reduce carbon emissions from fossil-fuel power plants.\n The project near Manchester, UK, will use spare green energy to compress air into a liquid and store it. When demand is higher, the liquid air is released back into a gas, powering a turbine that puts the green energy back into the grid.\n A big expansion of wind and solar energy is vital to tackle the climate emergency but they are not always available. Storage is therefore key and the new project will be the largest in the world outside of pumped hydro schemes, which require a mountain reservoir to store water.\n This revolutionary new facility will form a key part of our push towards net zero\n The new liquid air battery, being developed by  Highview Power, is due to be operational in 2022 and will be able to power up to 200,000 homes for five hours, and store power for many weeks. Chemical batteries are also needed for the transition to a zero-carbon world and are plummeting in price, but can only store relatively small amounts of electricity for short periods.\n Liquid air batteries can be constructed anywhere, said Highview\u2019s chief executive, Javier Cavada: \u201cAir is everywhere in the world. The main competitor is really not other storage technologies but fossil fuels, as people still want to continue building gas and coal-fired plants today, strangely enough,\u201d he said.\n The UK government has supported the project with a \u00a310m grant. The energy and clean growth minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: \u201cThis revolutionary new facility will form a key part of our push towards net zero, bringing greater flexibility to Britain\u2019s electricity grid and creating green-collar jobs in Greater Manchester.\n \u201cProjects like these will help us realise the full value of our world-class renewables, ensuring homes and businesses can still be powered by green energy, even when the sun is not shining and the wind not blowing,\u201d he said.\n  The UK government is  being urged to make the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic a green one. \u201cWe owe it to future generations to build back better,\u201d  said the prime minister, Boris Johnson, recently, while the chancellor,  Rishi Sunak, is reported to be planning a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d.\n Alex Buckman, an energy storage expert at the  Energy Systems Catapult group, said polluting gas power plants were the main way the UK electricity grid was balanced. But a net zero carbon system would need more than the 30% renewable energy of today and therefore more storage.\n \u201cThere is likely going to be a need for one or more of the medium-to-long duration electricity storage technologies to fill a gap in the market, and liquid air energy storage (LAES) is right up there as an option,\u201d he said. Pumped hydro is limited by the need for a mountain reservoir, while gravity storage \u2013 where you raise a weight and then let it drop to power a generator \u2013 is less developed, as is large-scale production of hydrogen fuel from green energy.\n \u201cThe combination of being more developed and more scalable provides LAES with an opportunity to be competitive, if they can prove that they can reduce costs with increased scale,\u201d Buckman said.\n The Highview battery will store 250MWh of energy, almost double the amount stored by the  biggest chemical battery, built by Tesla in South Australia. The new project is sited at the Trafford Energy Park, also home to the Carrington gas-powered energy plant and a closed coal power station.\n The project will cost \u00a385m, and Highview received  \u00a335m of investment from the Japanese machinery giant Sumitomo in February. The liquid air battery is creating 200 jobs, mainly in construction, and employing former oil and gas engineers, with a few dozen in the continuing operation. The plant\u2019s lifetime is expected to be 30-40 years. \u201cIt will pass to the next generation,\u201d said Cavada.\n Highview is developing other sites in the UK, continental Europe and the US, including in  Vermont, but the Manchester project will be the first. \u201cThe first one is definitely the most important and this is why we really value the UK government\u2019s bold move to use UK technology to solve UK problems and afterwards export the tech globally,\u201d said Cavada.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 20:28:26", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

"note_en": "So someone asks how they should go about  getting a group of people together to work on a software project. I, with a massive ego propped up by very little talent, ability or experience,  decided to answer it. Many of these ideas have been said elsewhere in various forms, but this seems to be a nice compaction of them.\n  Start writing it. No, really. Go start coding. Upload the notes, the sketches, whatever. Put it up on Google Code, Rubyforge or something similar. Haunt the IRC channels and mailing lists for the tools you are using and post news everytime you put out a new release. Be sure not to post in places that won\u2019t care, and don\u2019t post too much. Talk about it with friends. Even friends that have no idea what a compiler is.\n The nerds will come to you but you\u2019ve got to work your ass off first. No one, absolutely no one, who is any fucking good will come near your project if its nothing more than a few airy ideas. Excepting, of course, those close friends that you\u2019ve already had long discussions with. But if you had friends with a clue, you wouldn\u2019t need to ask this question.\n I understand. I, too, have a group of friends who don\u2019t share my peccadilloes. And it can be a strength. It teaches you to hone your description of what you are doing down to its simplest core. It teaches you how to tell yourself what you are doing. Clarity of thought is essential.\n Most of your friends won\u2019t understand it. Some will love it for terrible reasons. The rest will think its dumb. If you have a couple of shitty \u201cfriends\u201d you only hang around with for historical reasons (like I do) you will invariably have the conversation swiped from you 20 seconds into your 30 second pitch because.. well.. because they are fucking assholes. Almost all of the opinions you hear will be worthless, even from friends with half a clue or more.\n Cling to the positive responses. You and I know they mean nothing in relation to the project, but they mean everything in relation to you. It means they think you have good ideas in the areas they understand, and believe in you enough to have good ideas in the areas they don\u2019t. Knowing that can ride you along when you\u2019re coming back from another day at some shitty job to code for 10 more hours before crashing, or, at least, wishing you could crash as you pace your hallway thinking about what needs to be done.\n  You don\u2019t have to code everyday, if it\u2019s just a side project, but you\u2019ve got to do it damn near. If you aren\u2019t blowing off your friends to work on it at least once a month or more, you aren\u2019t working hard enough on it. If this is really to be a start up, you need to be blowing them off all the time. It sucks. Get used to it. You\u2019ve got a world to change. (Note: I have experience with side projects and have second-hand experience with startups)\n But don\u2019t overwork. Insight comes from your brain hashing together your work and your knowledge and your experiences from elsewhere. That mashup club that you heard about? Go check it out. Read some philosophy. Read some comic books. Read something you sort-of-know-about-but-not-really.\n Read a shit ton about programming. programming.reddit and Planet Intertwingly are good places to start. The first for what all the cool kids are talking about and the latter for intelligent debate, and odd viewpoints all mixed together. (Er, I should mention I was recently added on to the blog roll there, but I was a huge fan of it way, way before that. In other words, I\u2019m not a self-promoting jerk, just a regular old jerk.)\n Write good code. Go back over older code and rewrite it. Then come back later and rewrite it again. Make it better. But don\u2019t stop coding because you can\u2019t \u201cget it right\u201d. If its ugly or sucks or doesn\u2019t pass the tests, put in some placeholder code with a FIXME comment above it. This can be a good place for others to help fill in the gaps but never, ever leave something like that if all you have is the hope that someone will fix it. Ask them, or do it yourself later.\n Test. Test a lot. Write tools or use already established tools to make it easier for you. I suggest the latter, though I\u2019ve had to adapt other\u2019s work to test my current \u201cbig project\u201d. If your project is different enough or big enough, there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll be adapting the work of others, too. Testing is what will remind you that you put all of those shitty FIXME comments in your code.\n If you stop coding for a couple of days, get pissed at yourself and code angry. Code real fucking angry.\n You might break a keyboard, but it\u2019ll be worth it. This is one you have to experience to believe. There is little like coding through your frustration, aggravation and even constipation and finally, finally getting it right.\n Anger and love and frustration and elation and sadness and comfort, each of these you will feel when you are coding. Some you\u2019ll feel more than others. All of them will, at some point, make you want to stop. Don\u2019t.\n Remember: coding isn\u2019t just putting characters in a text editor, but all those hours you spent thinking don\u2019t count until you punch the fucking keys. Time isn\u2019t your enemy as much as your will to continue on is. And time is a big fucking enemy in a startup.\n Go. Go fucking hard. That\u2019s how you get people to come in. Oh, and you\u2019ll probably fail. But it\u2019ll be a good failure. It\u2019ll be the kind of failure that you can turn into a victory later.\n People say failure \u201cbuilds character\u201d or \u201chelps you grow\u201d. That\u2019s pretty much just a bullshit short way of saying this:\n You don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll fuck up until you do. The next time you\u2019re about to fuck up, you might see how to not fuck up. You might see a new opportunity because of the way things fucked up, or the state your fuck up left you. Also, some other people with experience or money might see your fuck up and realize that a) you\u2019ve actually got some chops or b) you could have some chops with some help. They will help you. Maybe. Fucking up will be easier next time, except when it doesn\u2019t but if you\u2019ve got chops it all starts coming together. Eventually.\n Fail hard. Fail with motherfucking gusto.

"note_en": "Scientists working on the Xenon1T experiment have detected more activity within their detector than they would otherwise expect.\n This &#34;excess of events&#34; could point to the existence of a previously undetected dark matter particle called an axion.\n    There are three potential explanations for the new signal from the Xenon1T experiment. Two require new physics to explain, while one of them is consistent with a hypothesised dark matter particle called a solar axion.\n  So far, scientists have only observed indirect evidence of dark matter. A definitive, direct detection of dark matter particles has yet to be made.\n  There are several theories to account for what that particle might be like. The most favoured one has been the WIMP, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particle.\n Physicists working on the Xenon series of experiments have spent more than a decade hunting for signs of these WIMPs. But the search has been fruitless.\n   The experiment was operated deep underground at the Gran Sasso facility in Italy, from 2016 to 2018.\n Its detector was filled with 3.2 tonnes of ultra-pure liquefied xenon, two tonnes of which served as a &#34;target&#34; for interactions between the xenon atoms and other particles that were passing through.\n When a particle crosses the target, it can generate tiny flashes of light and free electrons from a xenon atom.\n Most of these interactions - also known as events - are with particles we already know about, such as muons, cosmic rays and neutrinos. This constitutes what scientists refer to as the background signal.\n  A potential signal from an undiscovered particle needs to be strong enough to rise above this background noise.\n Scientists carefully estimated the number of background events in Xenon1T. They expected to see roughly 232, but the experiment instead saw 285 - an excess of 53 events.\n One explanation could be a new, previously unconsidered source of background contamination, caused by the presence of tiny amounts of tritium in the Xenon1T detector.\n It could also be due to neutrinos, trillions of which pass through your body, unhindered, every second. One explanation could be that the magnetic moment (a property of all particles) of neutrinos is larger than its value in the Standard Model, which categorises the elementary particles in physics.\n  This would be a strong hint that some other new physics is needed to explain it.\n However, the excess is most consistent with a signal from solar axions, a very light as-yet undetected particle, which is also a dark matter candidate.\n  While this significance is fairly high, it is not large enough to conclude that axions exist. Five sigma is generally the accepted threshold for a discovery.\n The significance of both the tritium and neutrino magnetic moment hypotheses corresponds to 3.2 sigma, meaning that they are also consistent with the data.\n Scientists working on the Xenon collaboration are currently upgrading to a different iteration called XENONnT. With better data from this future version, they are confident they will soon find out whether the excess is a statistical fluke, a background contaminant, or something far more exciting.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 19:35:48", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u641c\u5bfb,matter,\u7c92\u5b50", "title": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u641c\u5bfb\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7", "title_en": "Dark matter hunt yields unexplained signal", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-53085260", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u641c\u5bfb", "matter", "\u7c92\u5b50"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a94d546699552a61a88abe3f62823833.png", "infoid": 1007080, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9605\u8bfb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u4f60\u5c06\u8be6\u7ec6\u4e86\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001\u3002\n\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u719f\u6089\u548c\u719f\u6089\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u590d\u6570\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u6211\u4eec\u4f1a\u6559\u4f60\u7684\u3002\n\u4ee5\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u52a9\u8bb0\u5a92\u4f53\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u53ef\u4ee5\u6beb\u4e0d\u8d39\u529b\u5730\u8bb0\u4f4f\u4f60\u8bfb\u5230\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\n\u201c\u91cf\u5b50\u56fd\u5ea6\u201d\u662f\u4e00\u672c\u65b0\u4e66\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u754c\u9762\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u8fd9\u5728\u50cf\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ba9\u8bb8\u591a\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5bf9\u964c\u751f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0d\u77e5\u6240\u63aa\u3002", "note_en": "By working through these essays, you will understand in detail all the basic principles of quantum computing and quantum mechanics, plus two important applications: the quantum search algorithm and quantum teleportation.\n You\u2019ll need familiarity and comfort with the basics of linear algebra and complex numbers.

"note_en": "The reality of security is mathematical, based on the probability of different risks and the effectiveness of different countermeasures. We can calculate how secure your home is from burglary, based on such factors as the crime rate in the neighborhood you live in and your door-locking habits. We can calculate how likely it is for you to be murdered, either on the streets by a stranger or in your home by a family member. Or how likely you are to be the victim of identity theft. Given a large enough set of statistics on criminal acts, it&#39;s not even hard; insurance companies do it all the time.\n We can also calculate how much more secure a burglar alarm will make your home, or how well a credit freeze will protect you from identity theft. Again, given enough data, it&#39;s easy.\n But security is also a feeling, based not on probabilities and mathematical calculations, but on your psychological reactions to both risks and countermeasures. You might feel terribly afraid of terrorism, or you might feel like it&#39;s not something worth worrying about. You might feel safer when you see people taking their shoes off at airport metal detectors, or you might not. You might feel that you&#39;re at high risk of burglary, medium risk of murder, and low risk of identity theft. And your neighbor, in the exact same situation, might feel that he&#39;s at high risk of identity theft, medium risk of burglary, and low risk of murder.\n Or, more generally, you can be secure even though you don&#39;t feel secure. And you can feel secure even though you&#39;re not. The feeling and reality of security are certainly related to each other, but they&#39;re just as certainly not the same as each other. We&#39;d probably be better off if we had two different words for them.\n This essay is my initial attempt to explore the feeling of security: where it comes from, how it works, and why it diverges from the reality of security.\n Four fields of research--two very closely related--can help illuminate this issue. The first is behavioral economics, sometimes called behavioral finance. Behavioral economics looks at human biases--emotional, social, and cognitive--and how they affect economic decisions. The second is the psychology of decision-making, and more specifically bounded rationality, which examines how we make decisions. Neither is directly related to security, but both look at the concept of risk: behavioral economics more in relation to economic risk, and the psychology of decision-making more generally in terms of security risks. But both fields go a long way to explain the divergence between the feeling and the reality of security and, more importantly, where that divergence comes from.\n There is also direct research into the psychology of risk. Psychologists have studied risk perception, trying to figure out when we exaggerate risks and when we downplay them.\n A fourth relevant field of research is neuroscience. The psychology of security is intimately tied to how we think: both intellectually and emotionally. Over the millennia, our brains have developed complex mechanisms to deal with threats. Understanding how our brains work, and how they fail, is critical to understanding the feeling of security.\n These fields have a lot to teach practitioners of security, whether they&#39;re designers of computer security products or implementers of national security policy. And if this paper seems haphazard, it&#39;s because I am just starting to scratch the surface of the enormous body of research that&#39;s out there. In some ways I feel like a magpie, and that much of this essay is me saying: &#34;Look at this! Isn&#39;t it fascinating? Now look at this other thing! Isn&#39;t that amazing, too?&#34; Somewhere amidst all of this, there are threads that tie it together, lessons we can learn (other than &#34;people are weird&#34;), and ways we can design security systems that take the feeling of security into account rather than ignoring it.\n  Security is a trade-off. This is something I have written about extensively, and is a notion critical to understanding the psychology of security. There&#39;s no such thing as absolute security, and any gain in security always involves some sort of trade-off.\n Security costs money, but it also costs in time, convenience, capabilities, liberties, and so on. Whether it&#39;s trading some additional home security against the inconvenience of having to carry a key around in your pocket and stick it into a door every time you want to get into your house, or trading additional security from a particular kind of airplane terrorism against the time and expense of searching every passenger, all security is a trade-off.\n I remember in the weeks after 9/11, a reporter asked me: &#34;How can we prevent this from ever happening again?&#34; &#34;That&#39;s easy,&#34; I said, &#34;simply ground all the aircraft.&#34;\n It&#39;s such a far-fetched trade-off that we as a society will never make it. But in the hours after those terrorist attacks, it&#39;s exactly what we did. When we didn&#39;t know the magnitude of the attacks or the extent of the plot, grounding every airplane was a perfectly reasonable trade-off to make. And even now, years later, I don&#39;t hear anyone second-guessing that decision.\n It makes no sense to just look at security in terms of effectiveness. &#34;Is this effective against the threat?&#34; is the wrong question to ask. You need to ask: &#34;Is it a good trade-off?&#34; Bulletproof vests work well, and are very effective at stopping bullets. But for most of us, living in lawful and relatively safe industrialized countries, wearing one is not a good trade-off. The additional security isn&#39;t worth it: isn&#39;t worth the cost, discomfort, or unfashionableness. Move to another part of the world, and you might make a different trade-off.\n We make security trade-offs, large and small, every day. We make them when we decide to lock our doors in the morning, when we choose our driving route, and when we decide whether we&#39;re going to pay for something via check, credit card, or cash. They&#39;re often not the only factor in a decision, but they&#39;re a contributing factor. And most of the time, we don&#39;t even realize it. We make security trade-offs intuitively.\n These intuitive choices are central to life on this planet. Every living thing makes security trade-offs, mostly as a species--evolving this way instead of that way--but also as individuals. Imagine a rabbit sitting in a field, eating clover. Suddenly, he spies a fox. He&#39;s going to make a security trade-off: should I stay or should I flee? The rabbits that are good at making these trade-offs are going to live to reproduce, while the rabbits that are bad at it are either going to get eaten or starve. This means that, as a successful species on the planet, humans should be really good at making security trade-offs.\n And yet, at the same time we seem hopelessly bad at it. We get it wrong all the time. We exaggerate some risks while minimizing others. We exaggerate some costs while minimizing others. Even simple trade-offs we get wrong, wrong, wrong--again and again. A Vulcan studying human security behavior would call us completely illogical.\n The truth is that we&#39;re not bad at making security trade-offs. We are very well adapted to dealing with the security environment endemic to hominids living in small family groups on the highland plains of East Africa. It&#39;s just that the environment of New York in 2007 is different from Kenya circa 100,000 BC. And so our feeling of security diverges from the reality of security, and we get things wrong.\n There are several specific aspects of the security trade-off that can go wrong. For example:\n  The more your perception diverges from reality in any of these five aspects, the more your perceived trade-off won&#39;t match the actual trade-off. If you think that the risk is greater than it really is, you&#39;re going to overspend on mitigating that risk. If you think the risk is real but only affects other people--for whatever reason--you&#39;re going to underspend. If you overestimate the costs of a countermeasure, you&#39;re less likely to apply it when you should, and if you overestimate how effective a countermeasure is, you&#39;re more likely to apply it when you shouldn&#39;t. If you incorrectly evaluate the trade-off, you won&#39;t accurately balance the costs and benefits.\n A lot of this can be chalked up to simple ignorance. If you think the murder rate in your town is one-tenth of what it really is, for example, then you&#39;re going to make bad security trade-offs. But I&#39;m more interested in divergences between perception and reality that  can&#39;t be explained that easily. Why is it that, even if someone knows that automobiles kill 40,000 people each year in the U.S. alone, and airplanes kill only hundreds worldwide, he is more afraid of airplanes than automobiles? Why is it that, when food poisoning kills 5,000 people every year and 9/11 terrorists killed 2,973 people in one non-repeated incident, we are spending tens of billions of dollars per year (not even counting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan) on terrorism defense while the entire budget for the Food and Drug Administration in 2007 is only $1.9 billion?\n It&#39;s my contention that these irrational trade-offs can be explained by psychology. That something inherent in how our brains work makes us more likely to be afraid of flying than of driving, and more likely to want to spend money, time, and other resources mitigating the risks of terrorism than those of food poisoning. And moreover, that these seeming irrationalities have a good evolutionary reason for existing: they&#39;ve served our species well in the past. Understanding what they are, why they exist, and why they&#39;re failing us now is critical to understanding how we make security decisions. It&#39;s critical to understanding why, as a successful species on the planet, we make so many bad security trade-offs.\n  Most of the time, when the perception of security doesn&#39;t match the reality of security, it&#39;s because the perception of the risk doesn&#39;t match the reality of the risk. We worry about the wrong things: paying too much attention to minor risks and not enough attention to major ones. We don&#39;t correctly assess the magnitude of different risks. A lot of this can be chalked up to bad information or bad mathematics, but there are some general pathologies that come up over and over again.\n  Last, people overestimate risks that are being talked about and remain an object of public scrutiny.   1\n David Ropeik and George Gray have a longer list in their book  Risk: A Practical Guide for Deciding What&#39;s Really Safe and What&#39;s Really Dangerous in the World Around You:\n Most people are more afraid of risks that are new than those they&#39;ve lived with for a while. In the summer of 1999, New Yorkers were extremely afraid of West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne infection that had never been seen in the United States. By the summer of 2001, though the virus continued to show up and make a few people sick, the fear had abated. The risk was still there, but New Yorkers had lived with it for a while. Their familiarity with it helped them see it differently.\n Most people are less afraid of risks that are natural than those that are human-made. Many people are more afraid of radiation from nuclear waste, or cell phones, than they are of radiation from the sun, a far greater risk.\n Most people are less afraid of a risk they choose to take than of a risk imposed on them. Smokers are less afraid of smoking than they are of asbestos and other indoor air pollution in their workplace, which is something over which they have little choice.\n Most people are less afraid of risks if the risk also confers some benefits they want. People risk injury or death in an earthquake by living in San Francisco or Los Angeles because they like those areas, or they can find work there.\n Most people are more afraid of risks that can kill them in particularly awful ways, like being eaten by a shark, than they are of the risk of dying in less awful ways, like heart disease--the leading killer in America.\n Most people are less afraid of a risk they feel they have some control over, like driving, and more afraid of a risk they don&#39;t control, like flying, or sitting in the passenger seat while somebody else drives.\n Most people are less afraid of risks that come from places, people, corporations, or governments they trust, and more afraid if the risk comes from a source they don&#39;t trust. Imagine being offered two glasses of clear liquid. You have to drink one. One comes from Oprah Winfrey. The other comes from a chemical company. Most people would choose Oprah&#39;s, even though they have no facts at all about what&#39;s in either glass.\n We are more afraid of risks that we are more aware of and less afraid of risks that we are less aware of. In the fall of 2001, awareness of terrorism was so high that fear was rampant, while fear of street crime and global climate change and other risks was low, not because those risks were gone, but because awareness was down.\n We are much more afraid of risks when uncertainty is high, and less afraid when we know more, which explains why we meet many new technologies with high initial concern.\n Adults are much more afraid of risks to their children than risks to themselves. Most people are more afraid of asbestos in their kids&#39; school than asbestos in their own workplace.\n You will generally be more afraid of a risk that could directly affect you than a risk that threatens others. U.S. citizens were less afraid of terrorism before September 11, 2001, because up till then the Americans who had been the targets of terrorist attacks were almost always overseas. But suddenly on September 11, the risk became personal. When that happens, fear goes up, even though the statistical reality of the risk may still be very low.    2\n Others make these and similar points, which are summarized in Table 1.   3    4    5    6\n When you look over the list in Table 1, the most remarkable thing is how reasonable so many of them seem. This makes sense for two reasons. One, our perceptions of risk are deeply ingrained in our brains, the result of millions of years of evolution. And two, our perceptions of risk are generally pretty good, and are what have kept us alive and reproducing during those millions of years of evolution.\n   When our risk perceptions fail today, it&#39;s because of new situations that have occurred at a faster rate than evolution: situations that exist in the world of 2007, but didn&#39;t in the world of 100,000 BC. Like a squirrel whose predator-evasion techniques fail when confronted with a car, or a passenger pigeon who finds that evolution prepared him to survive the hawk but not the shotgun, our innate capabilities to deal with risk can fail when confronted with such things as modern human society, technology, and the media. And, even worse, they can be made to fail by others--politicians, marketers, and so on--who exploit our natural failures for their gain.\n   The human brain is a fascinating organ, but an absolute mess. Because it has evolved over millions of years, there are all sorts of processes jumbled together rather than logically organized. Some of the processes are optimized for only certain kinds of situations, while others don&#39;t work as well as they could. And there&#39;s some duplication of effort, and even some conflicting brain processes.\n Assessing and reacting to risk is one of the most important things a living creature has to deal with, and there&#39;s a very primitive part of the brain that has that job. It&#39;s the amygdala, and it sits right above the brainstem, in what&#39;s called the medial temporal lobe. The amygdala is responsible for processing base emotions that come from sensory inputs, like anger, avoidance, defensiveness, and fear. It&#39;s an old part of the brain, and seems to have originated in early fishes. When an animal--lizard, bird, mammal, even you--sees, hears, or feels something that&#39;s a potential danger, the amygdala is what reacts immediately. It&#39;s what causes adrenaline and other hormones to be pumped into your bloodstream, triggering the fight-or-flight response, causing increased heart rate and beat force, increased muscle tension, and sweaty palms.\n This kind of thing works great if you&#39;re a lizard or a lion. Fast reaction is what you&#39;re looking for; the faster you can notice threats and either run away from them or fight back, the more likely you are to live to reproduce.\n But the world is actually more complicated than that. Some scary things are not really as risky as they seem, and others are better handled by staying in the scary situation to set up a more advantageous future response. This means that there&#39;s an evolutionary advantage to being able to hold off the reflexive fight-or-flight response while you work out a more sophisticated analysis of the situation and your options for dealing with it.\n We humans have a completely different pathway to deal with  analyzing risk. It&#39;s the neocortex, a more advanced part of the brain that developed very recently, evolutionarily speaking, and only appears in mammals. It&#39;s intelligent and analytic. It can reason. It can make more nuanced trade-offs. It&#39;s also much slower.\n So here&#39;s the first fundamental problem: we have two systems for reacting to risk--a primitive intuitive system and a more advanced analytic system--and they&#39;re operating in parallel. And it&#39;s hard for the neocortex to contradict the amygdala.\n In his book  Mind Wide Open, Steven Johnson relates an incident when he and his wife lived in an apartment and a large window blew in during a storm. He was standing right beside it at the time and heard the whistling of the wind just before the window blew. He was lucky--a foot to the side and he would have been dead--but the sound has never left him:\n But ever since that June storm, a new fear has entered the mix for me: the sound of wind whistling through a window. I know now that our window blew in because it had been installed improperly\u2026. I am entirely convinced that the window we have now is installed correctly, and I trust our superintendent when he says that it is designed to withstand hurricane-force winds. In the five years since that June, we have weathered dozens of storms that produced gusts comparable to the one that blew it in, and the window has performed flawlessly.\n I know all these facts--and yet when the wind kicks up, and I hear that whistling sound, I can feel my adrenaline levels rise\u2026. Part of my brain--the part that feels most  me-like, the part that has opinions about the world and decides how to act on those opinions in a rational way--knows that the windows are safe\u2026. But another part of my brain wants to barricade myself in the bathroom all over again.   7\n There&#39;s a good reason evolution has wired our brains this way. If you&#39;re a higher-order primate living in the jungle and you&#39;re attacked by a lion, it makes sense that you develop a lifelong fear of lions, or at least fear lions more than another animal you haven&#39;t personally been attacked by.

"note_en": "Landing a spacecraft on Mars is hard enough. Doing it during a global pandemic makes the hair-raising task \u2014 \u201cterror\u201d is a word often associated with Mars landings \u2014 even more difficult. But NASA is pushing ahead with its plans to send a rover to Mars and remains on track to launch the spacecraft next month from Cape Canaveral, Fla., officials said Wednesday.\n Mars and Earth are only on the same side of the sun every 26 months, meaning NASA has a limited window to launch the spacecraft to the Red Planet. Storing the spacecraft and waiting another two years for the next opportunity could have cost \u201chalf a billion dollars,\u201d NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said during a news briefing Wednesday, so the space agency made the mission a high priority, despite the  coronavirus pandemic.\n   Despite the difficulties of working amid the virus, officials said they have made significant progress on what they called one of the most ambitious and significant robotic programs the space agency has tackled in years.\n Dubbed \u201cPerseverance,\u201d the SUV-size rover would embark on a $2.7 billion exploration mission to search for ancient signs of life on Mars and begin the first leg of an attempt to bring samples from the Red Planet back to Earth. Over the course of a mission that is expected to last some two years on the surface, the rover would also study the planet\u2019s climate and geology and help pave the way for human exploration, NASA said.\n The spacecraft also will be carrying a  small helicopter, called \u201cIngenuity,\u201d which would become the first rotorcraft to fly on another planet.\n  If all goes well, the spacecraft would lift off on an Atlas V rocket from the Florida Space Coast on July 20 and land on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. For the landing site, NASA has  chosen a crater called Jezero, the site of an ancient lake as well as a delta, where there are rocks that date back 4 billion years. Perseverance is expected to scour the area,  drilling for samples and signs of habitable conditions and even signs of ancient microbial life.\n  \u201cThe rover will study the record that is preserved in layers of rock on the surface of Mars \u2026 that could have proved evidence of the chemical building blocks of life,\u201d said Lori Glaze, the director of NASA\u2019s Planetary Science Division.\n The rover would  stockpile the samples on the Martian surface, to be picked up on a subsequent mission, to launch to Mars in 2026, for return to Earth. That would be a first, Glaze said.\n  Scientists have studied samples of meteorites that have come from Mars, but \u201cit\u2019s not the same as getting an actual sample of pristine Mars rock and soil to study,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re at a point where we can begin to attempt his amazing feat.\u201d\n With six wheels designed to handle the rugged Martian terrain, Perseverance in many ways looks like Curiosity, one of its predecessors on Mars. But it\u2019s a \u201cnew vehicle with new capabilities,\u201d said Matt Wallace, the Perseverance deputy program manager at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n  The spacecraft would be outfitted with a more powerful computer that would help guide it to the surface and help it avoid hazardous areas, such as rock piles. It would also have high-resolution cameras to record the landing.\n  \u201cWe should be able to watch this big parachute inflate supersonically,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cWe should be able to watch the rover deploy and touch down on the surface. And this is going to be very exciting \u2014 the first time that we have ever been able to see a spacecraft land on another planet.\u201d\n NASA said it hopes the mission will pave the way for an eventual human mission to the Red Planet.
