"note_en": "In the early 2000s, Brandon Sandmaier worked as a heavy-duty mechanic in Canada \u2019s tar sands, the world \u2019s largest industrial project, located in northern Alberta. He built pipelines and repaired 400-ton trucks that haul thick, oily bitumen through the open-pit mines. But after more than 10 years in the oil and gas industry, Sandmaier went back to school to study alternative energy in 2014. He knew he wanted to eventually start his own business and he saw potential for growth in solar. He now  ...\n Jake Kubiski was working as an electrician in Alberta \u2019s oil industry when he went on vacation to Costa Rica in 2015 and saw how renewable energy was booming there. Returning home, he decided to start a clean energy business in Alberta, where the industry was still nascent. Now the owner and CEO of Kuby Renewable Energy, an Edmonton-based solar contractor, he has hired about 10 staff with work experience in the fossil fuel industry. \u201cAlberta oil and gas field employees are extremely well-trained,  ...\n Sandmaier and Kubiski\u2019s businesses are part of a growing renewable energy sector in Alberta \u2014 unlikely shoots of life in a province that has been described as a petrostate. For decades, Alberta\u2019s economy was dominated by the exploitation of viscous bitumen in its vast tar sands, which hold the world\u2019s  third-largest oil reservesbehind Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. But since oil prices crashed in 2014, about 35,000 jobs in Alberta \u2019s tar sands have been lost, likely for good. Now, the Canadian  ...\n    As Alberta \u2019s oil and gas industry comes to grips with a long-lasting downturn, workers in the oil industry are beginning to look to the renewable energy sector to make up for the jobs being shed in the tar sands. A handful of nonprofit and economic development agencies are starting retraining programs to prepare former oilfield hands to work in solar and wind power. \u201cMost of the workers that reach out to us have been through boom-bust cycles once, twice, three times, \u201dsays Andrea Visser,  ...\n Sandmaier says more oil workers are reaching out to him to explore working in renewables. \u201cIf presented with an opportunity,\u201d he says, \u201cthey would take it.\u201d\n Rod Wood, national representative for the labor union, Unifor, which represents many oil and gas workers in Alberta, says that although there are a few forward-looking people in the energy industry, many remain resistant to change. But he says that as the tar sands industry continues to be buffeted and as the fight to slow climate change gathers momentum, an energy transition is inevitable. \u201cThe transition is going to occur, \u201dsays Wood, whether Albertans are ready for it or not. \u201cI think  ...\n Around 10 percent of Alberta\u2019s electricity generation currently comes from renewable energy sources, according to the  Canada Energy Regulator. However, renewables are growing fast: From 2005 to 2018, Alberta\u2019s installed renewable electricity capacity  nearly doubled, from 1,484 megawatts to 2,825 megawatts. More than 1,300 megawatts of renewable energy projects are now under construction in the province.\n     The Alberta government says that  8,100 people in the province work as solar installers and  3,200 people as wind turbine technicians. By one estimate, direct and indirect employment in Alberta\u2019s renewable energy sector totals  26,000 jobs, and two consulting firms,  Solas Energy Consulting and  the Delphi Group, forecast that as many as 20,000 new jobs may be created in Alberta\u2019s renewable energy sector by 2030. As of 2018, Alberta\u2019s oil and gas industry employed  153,000 people, a number that  ...\n Programs to retrain oil and gas workers are getting underway, albeit slowly. A non-profit corporation, Calgary Economic Development, recently started a U.S. $1.1 million program to transition unemployed oil and gas professionals to jobs in digital technology, such as software development and programming, which can be used in a variety of energy industries. And Iron &amp; Earth is rolling out three programs to train oil and gas workers in solar and wind energy later this year. The group  ...\n     Oil has long been the lifeblood of Alberta\u2019s economy. In 2018, the oil sands produced  2.9 million barrels per day, about two-thirds of Canada \u2019s total production. In the early 2000s, people from across the country flocked to Fort McMurray, the epicenter of the oil sands boom, to make six-figure salaries. Tar sands companies could not find enough workers. Then, oil prices crashed in 2014 and stayed low, in part because of the fracking boom south of the border in the United States. More  ...\n Those jobs are likely not coming back, according to Ian Hussey, research manager at the Parkland Institute, who wrote the report. Facing tighter budgets, oil companies have changed the way they operate to reduce costs. Suncor, an oil sands mining company, eliminated all drivers that operate massive haul trucks in one of its mines in 2018 and replaced them with driverless trucks. The company is now replicating that model at its other mines and is expecting to cut 400 drivers by 2023.  ...\n    As pressure grows to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, forces from outside Alberta are also threatening the oil sands, whose thick bitumen requires an extraction and refining process that produces more greenhouse gases than conventional oil. In recent months, major financial institutions \u2014 from Sweden\u2019s central bank to the world\u2019s largest asset manager, Blackrock \u2014 have  shifted away from investing in Alberta\u2019s fossil fuel industrydue to its climate impacts. And in February, Teck  ...\n The global economic recession created by the coronavirus has further darkened the outlook for the tar sands industry. As companies slash their spending and delay projects, Alberta\u2019s oil and gas sector is seeing hundreds of layoffs and thousands of jobs put on hold.\n While the majority of oil workers are not eager to switch careers, many see the writing on the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that they work in an industry that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d says Jamie Kirkpatrick, program manager at  Blue Green Canada, an alliance among labor unions, environmental groups, and civil society organizations that advocates for working people and the environment. However, he says, switching to other sectors can be unappealing since it often means taking a sizeable  ...\n While acknowledging the contribution of fossil fuels to people \u2019s livelihoods, Iron &amp; Earth is heading campaigns asking for federal and provincial government support to retrain fossil fuel workers and create more jobs in renewable energy. More than 5,000 people have signed the organization \u2019s pledge to \u201cstand with fossil fuel workers calling for training in renewable energy. \u201dIron &amp; Earth has already retrained a small number of fossil fuel workers and members of the Louis  ...\n     The Calgary Economic Development project is aimed at transitioning displaced oil and gas professionals, such as engineers and geoscientists, into the technology sector. The federally funded project is focused on Calgary, a hub for major oil companies that has been hit hard by the oil downturn. The program, which offers six months of free training, accepted 50 students in its first round, although 500 people applied. Another 50 students will take part in a second round of training  ...\n The previous left-of-center Alberta government bolstered clean-energy growth by pledging to generate 30 percent of the province\u2019s electricity from renewables by 2030. The province provided incentives to homeowners and businesses for solar installation and held three auctions for renewable power projects in 2017 and 2018, leading to the ongoing construction of 1,360 megawatts of renewable energy capacity.\n However, the current conservative government scrapped these programs when it came to power last year. Estimates now are that by 2030 renewables are likely to provide 19 percent of the province\u2019s electricity, doubling current generation, according to  one forecast.\n    Market forces are increasingly driving renewables growth in the province. Several major projects have secured funding from private investors despite the lack of support by the provincial government. A 400-megawatt  solar project, the largest in the country, received $500 million in backing from a Danish investment group earlier this year, and a North American energy company, TC Energy, agreed to buy more than half of the electricity generated by a 130-megawatt solar project  ...\n The recovery period that follows the current coronavirus-related swoon in the oil industry could be an opportunity to pivot to a new energy future in Alberta, Wood, the labor official, says. In March, the federal government said it was preparing a multibillion-dollar bailout for the struggling oil and gas industry. In response, 256 academics across Canada signed  a letterto Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urging the government to \u201csupport an economic recovery plan that encompasses  ...\n     For now, oil is still king. Less than two miles from Sandmaier\u2019s solar company, refineries continue to process more than 300,000 barrels a day. \u201cWe cannot just continue to prop up [the fossil fuel] industry,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to look at what industries do have hope.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:57:08", "tags": "\u5bfb\u627e,industry,\u827e\u4f2f\u5854\u7701,oil", "title":

"note_en": "William Shakespeare is widely regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time and one of the most important and influential people who has ever lived. His written works (plays, sonnets and poems) have been translated into more than 100 languages and these are performed around the world.\n There is also an enduring desire to learn more about the man himself. Countless books and articles have been written about Shakespeare\u2019s life. These have been based primarily on the scholarly analysis of his works and the official record associated with him and his family. Shakespeare\u2019s popularity and legacy endures, despite  uncertainties in his life story and debate surrounding  his authorship and identity.\n The life and times of William Shakespeare and his family have also recently been informed by cutting-edge archaeological methods and interdisciplinary technologies at both New Place (his long-since demolished family home) and his burial place at Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon. The  evidence gathered from these investigationsby the Centre of Archaeology at Staffordshire University provides new insights into his interests, attitudes and motivations \u2013and those of his family \u2013and shows  ...\n Archaeology has the ability to provide a direct connection to an individual through the places and objects associated with them. Past excavations of the  Shakespearean-era theatres in London have provided evidence of the  places he worked and spent much of his time.\n Attributing objects to Shakespeare is difficult, we have his written work of course,  his portrait(s) and  memorial bust \u2013 but all of his known possessions, like those  mentioned in his will, no longer exist. A single gold signet ring, inscribed with the initials W S, is thought by some to be the most significant object owned and used by the poet, despite its  questionable provenance.\n  Shakespeare\u2019s greatest and most expensive possession was his house, New Place. Evidence, obtained through  recent archaeological investigations of its foundations, give us quantifiable insights into Shakespeare\u2019s thought processes, personal life and business success.\n The building itself was lost in the 18th century, but the site and its remains were preserved beneath a garden. Erected in the centre of Stratford-upon-Avon more than a century prior to Shakespeare\u2019s purchase in 1597, from its inception, it was architecturally striking. One of the largest domestic residences in Stratford, it was the only courtyard-style, open-hall house within the town.\n  This type of house typified the merchant and elite classes and in purchasing and renovating it to his own vision, Shakespeare inherited the traditions of his ancestors while embracing the latest fashions. The building materials used, its primary structure and later redevelopment can all be used as evidence of the  deliberate and carefully considered choices made by him and his family.\n Shakespeare focused on the outward appearance of the house, installing a long gallery and other fashionable architectural embellishments as was expected of a well-to-do, aspiring gentleman of the time. Many other  medieval features were retained and the hall was likely retained as the showpiece of his home, a place to announce his prosperity, and his rise in status.\n It provided a place for him and his immediate and extended family to live, work and entertain. But it was also a place which held local significance and symbolic associations. Intriguingly, its appearance also resembled the courtyard inn theatres of London and elsewhere with which Shakespeare was so familiar, presenting the opportunity to host private performances.\n   Extensive evidence of the personal possessions, diet and the leisure activities of Shakespeare, his family and the inhabitants of New Place were recovered during the archaeological investigations, revolutionising what we understand about his day-to-day life.\n An  online exhibition, due to be made available in early May 2020, presents 3D-scanned artefacts recovered at the site of New Place. These objects, some of which may have belonged to Shakespeare, have been chosen to characterise the chronological development and activities undertaken at the site.\n  Open access to these virtual objects will enable the dissemination of these important results and the potential for others to continue the research.\n  Archaeological evidence recovered from non-invasive investigations at Shakespeare\u2019s burial place has also been used to provide further evidence of his personal and family belief. Multi-frequency Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was  used to investigate the Shakespeare family graves below the chancel of Holy Trinity Church.\n A  number of legendssurrounded Shakespeare \u2019s burial place. Among these were doubts over the presence of a grave, its contents, tales of grave robbing and suggestions of a large family crypt. The work confirmed that individual shallow graves exist beneath the tombstones and that the various members of Shakespeare \u2019s family were not buried in coffins, but in simple shrouds. Analysis concluded that Shakespeare \u2019s grave had been disturbed in the past and that it was likely that his  ...\n  These family graves occupy a significant (and expensive) location in Holy Trinity Church. Despite this, the simple nature of Shakespeare\u2019s grave, with no elite trappings or finery and no large family crypt, coupled with his belief that he should not be disturbed, confirm a simple regional practice based on pious religious observance and an affinity with his hometown.\n    There is still so much we don\u2019t know about Shakespeare\u2019s life, so it\u2019s a safe bet that researchers will continue to investigate what evidence there is. Archaeological techniques can provide quantifiable information that isn\u2019t available through traditional Shakespearean research. But just like other disciplines, interpretation \u2013 based on the evidence \u2013 will be key to unlocking the mysteries surrounding the life (and death) of the English language\u2019s greatest

We have partially released the source code used in this work. You can find the user-level packet I/O engine for Intel 82598/82599 NICs  here. We do not have a definite release plan for other parts of the PacketShader code not made available on the web as of today.\n    PacketShader is a high-performance PC-based software router platform that accelerates the core packet processing with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Based on our observation that the CPU is the typical performance bottleneck in high-speed sofware routers, we scale the computing power in a cost-effective manner with massively-parallel GPU. PacketShader offloads computation and memory-intensive router applications to GPUs while optimizing the packet reception and transmission path on Linux.  ...\n    As you all know, GPU is a central chip in your graphics card. GPUs expose a high level of processing parallelism by supporting tens of thousands of hardware threads and ample memory bandwidth. Beyond fast graphics rendering, recent GPUs are widely used for high-performance parallel applications whose workloads require enormous computation cycles and/or memory bandwidth. The data-parallel execution model of GPU fits nicely with inherent parallelism in most router applications.\n    We implemented high-performance packet I/O engine for user-level application.  This project is being maintained separately, and the source code is publicly available now.  Currently-available Linux network stack is not optimized for high-performance IP packet processing, say, for multi-10G networks. For high-speed software routers and better utilization of GPUs, we optimize the packet I/O path in Linux with the following approach.\n  Huge packet buffer: Instead of allocating metadata (sk_buff or skb) and packet data for each packet reception, PacketShader pre-allocates two circular buffers that can hold a large array of metadata and packet data. This greatly reduces the memory allocation/deallocation overhead for high-speed packet reception.\n  Batch processing: PacketShader batch processes a group of packets at a time in the hardware, device driver, and even in the application layer. This amortize per-packet processing overhead.\n  NUMA-aware data placement: PacketShader minimizes packet movement between local and remote memory in a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) system. Packets received by NICs are processed by its local CPU and memory.\n  Multi-core CPU scalability: PacketShader takes advantage of receive-side scaling (RSS) to eliminate the lock contention in accessing the NIC queues. It also removes the false sharing problem with the CPU cache by aligning the start address of RX queue to the cacheline boundary. Finally, it removes the global  ...\n  With our packet I/O optimization, we are able to run the packet processing in  the user level even for multi-10G router workloads.\n    Figure 1 shows the performance of our optimized packet I/O engine. RX+TX bars represent the case of no-op forwarding, which transmits a packet from a port to another port without further processing.\n    We have implemented four &#34;router applications&#34; based on the packet I/O engine: IPv4 forwarding, IPv6 forwarding, OpenFlow switch, and IPsec tunneling. The below four graphs compare the throughput of the CPU-only implementation and the GPU-accelerated implementation. The performance results clearly show  ...\n    For the IP forwarding, we offloaded longest prefix matching to GPU. Forwarding table lookup is highly memory-intensive, and GPU can acclerate it with both latency hiding capability and bandwidth.\n    OpenFlow and IPsec represent compute-intensive workloads of software routers in our work. We have confirmed that compute-intensive applications can benefit from GPU as well as memory-intensive applications.\n    Our prototype implementation uses two four-core Intel Nehalem CPUs (2.66GHz), four dual-port 10GbE Intel NICs, and two NVIDIA GTX 480 cards. Since we use many PCI-e devices, our machine adopts two IOHs (formerly called Northbridge). Interestingly, the performance of our system is limited by the dual-IOH  ...\n        PacketShader: a GPU-accelerated Software Router ( slides)    Sangjin Han, Keon Jang, KyoungSoo Park and Sue Moon.

"note_en": "Software development teams find life can be much easier if they integrate their work as often as they can. They also find it valuable to release frequently into production. But teams don&#39;t want to expose half-developed features to their users. A useful technique to deal with this tension is to build all the back-end code, integrate, but don&#39;t build the user-interface. The feature can be integrated and tested, but the UI is held back until the end until, like a keystone, it&#39;s added to  ...\n A simple example of this technique might be to give a customer the option of a rush order. Such an order needs to be priced, depending on where the customer lives and what delivery companies operate there. The nature of the goods involved affects the picking approach used in the warehouse. Certain customers may qualify to have rush orders available to them, which may also depend on the delivery location, the time of year, and the kind of goods ordered.\n All in all that&#39;s a fair bit of business logic, particularly since it will involve gnarly integration with various warehousing, catalog, and customer service systems. Doing this could take several weeks, while other features, need to be released every few days. But as far as the user is concerned, a rush order is just a check-box on the order form.\n To build this using the check-box as the keystone, the team does development work on the underlying business logic and interfaces to internal systems over the course of several production releases. The user is unaware of all this latent code. Only with the last step does the keystone check-box need to be made visible, which can be done in a relatively short time. This way all latent code can be integrated and be part of the system going into production, reducing the problems that come with a long-lived  ...\n  The latent code does need to be tested to the same degree of confidence that it would be if it were active. This can be done providing the architecture of the system is setup so that most testing isn&#39;t done through the user interface.  Unit Tests and other lower layers of the  Test Pyramid should be easy to run this way. Even  Broad Stack Tests can be run providing there is a mechanism to make them  Subcutaneous Tests. In some cases there will a significant amount of behavior within the UI itself,  ...\n Not all applications are built in such a way that they can be extensively tested in a subcutaneous manner - but the effort required to do this is worthwhile even without the capability to use a keystone. Tests running through the UI are always more trouble to setup, even with the best tools to automate the process. Moving more tests to subcutaneous and lower level tests, especially unit tests, can dramatically speed up  Deployment Pipelines and enable  Continuous Delivery.\n Of course, most UIs will be more than a check-box, although often they aren&#39;t that much more work to keystone. In a web app, a complex feature will often be an independent web page, that can be built and tested in full, and the keystone is merely a link. A desktop may have several screens where the keystone is the menu-item to make them visible.\n That said, there are cases when the UI can&#39;t be packaged into a simple keystone. When that&#39;s the case then it&#39;s time to use  Feature Toggles. Even in this case, however, thinking of a keystone can be useful by ensuring that the feature toggle only applies to the UI. This avoids scattering lots of toggle points through the back end code, reduces the complexity of applying the toggle, allows the use of  simple toggle mechanisms, and makes it easier to remove when the time comes.\n There is a general danger with developing a UI last, in that the back-end code may be designed in a way that doesn&#39;t work with the UI once it&#39;s built, or the UI isn&#39;t given the attention it needs until late, leading to a lack of iteration and a poor user experience. For those reasons a keystone approach works best within an overall approach that encourages building a product through thin vertical slices that lead to releasing small but fully working features rapidly.\n I&#39;ve used the example of a user-interface here, but of course the same approach can be used with any other interface, such as an API. By building the consumer&#39;s interface last, and keeping it simple, we can build and integrate even large features in small chunks.\n Dark Launching is a variation where the new feature is called once its built, but no results are shown to the user. This is done to measure the impact on the back-end systems, which is useful for some changes. Once all is good, we can add the keystone.\n I first came across the metaphor of a keystone for this technique in the second edition of Kent Beck&#39;s  Extreme Programming Explained .

"note_en": "One of the questions I get asked the most these days is when the world will be able to go back to the way things were in December before the coronavirus pandemic. My answer is always the same: when we have an almost perfect drug to treat COVID-19, or when almost every person on the planet has been vaccinated against coronavirus.\n The former is unlikely to happen anytime soon. We\u2019d need a miracle treatment that was at least 95 percent effective to stop the outbreak. Most of the  drug candidates right now are nowhere near that powerful. They could save a lot of lives, but they aren\u2019t enough to get us back to normal.\n  Humankind has never had a more urgent task than creating broad immunity for coronavirus. Realistically, if we\u2019re going to return to normal, we need to develop a safe, effective vaccine. We need to make billions of doses, we need to get them out to every part of the world, and we need all of this to happen as quickly as possible.\n That sounds daunting, because it is. Our foundation is the biggest funder of vaccines in the world, and this effort dwarfs anything we\u2019ve ever worked on before. It\u2019s going to require a global cooperative effort like the world has never seen. But I know it\u2019ll get done. There\u2019s simply no alternative.\n Here\u2019s what you need to know about the race to create a COVID-19 vaccine.\n  Dr. Anthony Fauci has said he thinks it\u2019ll take around eighteen months to develop a coronavirus vaccine. I agree with him, though it could be as little as 9 months or as long as two years.\n Although eighteen months might sound like a long time, this would be the fastest scientists have created a new vaccine. Development usually takes around five years. Once you pick a disease to target, you have to create the vaccine and test it on animals. Then you begin testing for safety and efficacy in humans.\n Safety and efficacy are the two most important goals for every vaccine.  Safety is exactly what it sounds like: is the vaccine safe to give to people? Some minor side effects (like a mild fever or injection site pain) can be acceptable, but you don\u2019t want to inoculate people with something that makes them sick.\n Efficacy measures how well the vaccine protects you from getting sick. Although you\u2019d ideally want a vaccine to have 100 percent efficacy, many don\u2019t. For example, this year\u2019s flu vaccine is  around 45 percent effective.\n  Phase one is the safety trial. A small group of healthy volunteers gets the vaccine candidate. You try out different dosages to create the strongest immune response at the lowest effective dose without serious side effects.\n  Once you\u2019ve settled on a formula, you move onto  phase two, which tells you how well the vaccine works in the people who are intended to get it. This time, hundreds of people get the vaccine. This cohort should include people of different ages and health statuses.\n  Then, in  phase three, you give it to thousands of people. This is usually the longest phase, because it occurs in what\u2019s called \u201cnatural disease conditions.\u201d You introduce it to a large group of people who are likely already at the risk of infection by the target pathogen, and then wait and see if the vaccine reduces how many people get sick.\n After the vaccine passes all three trial phases, you start building the factories to manufacture it, and it gets submitted to the WHO and various government agencies for approval.\n This process works well for most vaccines, but the normal development timeline isn\u2019t good enough right now. Every day we can cut from this process will make a huge difference to the world in terms of saving lives and reducing trillions of dollars in economic damage.\n So, to speed up the process, vaccine developers are compressing the timeline. This graphic shows how:\n       In the traditional process, the steps are sequential to address key questions and unknowns. This can help mitigate financial risk, since creating a new vaccine is expensive. Many candidates fail, which is why companies wait to invest in the next step until they know the previous step was successful.\n For COVID-19, financing development is not an issue. Governments and other organizations (including our foundation and an amazing alliance called the  Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) have made it clear they will support whatever it takes to find a vaccine. So, scientists are able to save time by doing several of the development steps at once. For example, the private sector, governments, and our foundation are going to start identifying facilities to manufacture  ...\n Fortunately, compressing the trial timeline isn\u2019t the only way to take a process that usually takes five years and get it done in 18 months. Another way we\u2019re going to do that is by testing lots of different approaches at the same time.\n  As of April 9, there are  115 different COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the development pipeline. I think that eight to ten of those look particularly promising. (Our foundation is going to keep an eye on all the others to see if we missed any that have some positive characteristics, though.)\n     The most promising candidates take a variety of approaches to protecting the body against COVID-19. To understand what exactly that means, it\u2019s helpful to remember how the human immune system works.\n When a disease pathogen gets into your system, your immune system responds by producing antibodies. These antibodies attach themselves to substances called  antigens on the surface of the microbe, which sends a signal to your body to attack. Your immune system keeps a record of every microbe it has ever defeated, so that it can quickly recognize and destroy invaders before they make you ill.\n Vaccines circumvent this whole process by teaching your body how to defeat a pathogen without ever getting sick. The two most common types\u2014and the ones you\u2019re probably most familiar with\u2014are inactivated and live  vaccines. Inactivated vaccines contain pathogens that have been killed. Live vaccines, on the other hand, are made of living pathogens that have been weakened (or \u201cattenuated \u201d). They \u2019re highly effective but more prone to side effects than their inactivated  ...\n Inactivated and live vaccines are what we consider \u201ctraditional\u201d approaches. There are a number of COVID-19 vaccine candidates of both types, and for good reason: they\u2019re well-established. We know how to test and manufacture them.\n The downside is that they\u2019re time-consuming to make. There\u2019s a ton of material in each dose of a vaccine. Most of that material is biological, which means you have to grow it. That takes time, unfortunately.\n That\u2019s why I\u2019m particularly excited by two new approaches that some of the candidates are taking:  RNA and DNA vaccines. If one of these new approaches pans out, we\u2019ll likely be able to get vaccines out to the whole world much faster. (For the sake of simplicity, I\u2019m only going to explain RNA vaccines. DNA vaccines are similar, just with a different type of genetic material and method of administration.)\n Our foundation\u2014both through our own funding and through  CEPI\u2014has been supporting the development of an RNA vaccine platform for nearly a decade. We were planning to use it to make vaccines for diseases that affect the poor like malaria, but now it\u2019s looking like one of the most promising options for COVID. The first candidate to start human trials was an RNA vaccine created by a company called Moderna.\n Here\u2019s how an RNA vaccine works: rather than injecting a pathogen\u2019s antigen into your body, you instead give the body the genetic code needed to produce that antigen itself. When the antigens appear on the outside of your cells, your immune system attacks them\u2014and learns how to defeat future intruders in the process. You essentially turn your body into its own vaccine manufacturing unit.\n Because RNA vaccines let your body do most of the work, they don \u2019t require much material. That makes them much faster to manufacture. There \u2019s a catch, though: we don \u2019t know for sure yet if RNA is a viable platform for vaccines. Since COVID would be the first RNA vaccine out of the gate, we have to prove both that the platform itself works and that it creates immunity. It \u2019s a bit like building your computer system and your first piece of software at the same  ...\n Even if an RNA vaccine continues to show promise, we still must continue pursuing the other options. We don\u2019t know yet what the COVID-19 vaccine will look like. Until we do, we have to go full steam ahead on as many approaches as possible.\n  The smallpox vaccine is the only vaccine that\u2019s wiped an entire disease off the face of the earth, but it\u2019s also pretty brutal to receive. It left a scar on the arm of anyone who got it. One out of every three people had side effects bad enough to keep them home from school or work. A small\u2014but not insignificant\u2014number developed more serious reactions.\n The smallpox vaccine was far from perfect, but it got the job done. The COVID-19 vaccine might be similar.\n If we were designing the perfect vaccine, we\u2019d want it to be completely safe and 100 percent effective. It should be a single dose that gives you lifelong protection, and it should be easy to store and transport. I hope the COVID-19 vaccine has all of those qualities, but given the timeline we\u2019re on, it may not.\n The two priorities, as I mentioned earlier, are  safety and  efficacy. Since we might not have time to do multi-year studies, we will have to conduct robust phase 1 safety trials and make sure we have good real-world evidence that the vaccine is completely safe to use.\n We have a bit more wiggle room with efficacy. I suspect a vaccine that is at least 70 percent effective will be enough to stop the outbreak. A 60 percent effective vaccine is useable, but we might still see some localized outbreaks. Anything under 60 percent is unlikely to create enough herd immunity to stop the virus.\n The big challenge will be making sure the vaccine works well in older people. The older you are, the less effective vaccines are. Your immune system\u2014like the rest of your body\u2014ages and is slower to recognize and attack invaders. That\u2019s a big issue for a COVID-19 vaccine, since older people are the most vulnerable. We need to make sure they\u2019re protected.\n The shingles vaccine\u2014which is also targeted to older people\u2014combats this by amping up the strength of the vaccine. It\u2019s possible we do something similar for COVID, although it might come with more side effects. Health authorities could also ask people over a certain age to get an additional dose.\n  How many doses will it be? A vaccine you only get once is easier and quicker to deliver. But we may need a multi-dose vaccine to get enough efficacy.\n  How long does it last? Ideally, the vaccine will give you long-lasting protection. But we might end up with one that only stops you from getting sick for a couple months (like the seasonal flu vaccine, which protects you for about six months). If that happens, the short-term vaccine might be used while we work on a more durable one.\n  How do you store it? Many common vaccines are kept at 4 degrees C. That\u2019s around the temperature of your average refrigerator, so storage and transportation is easy. But RNA vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperature\u2014as low as -80 degrees C\u2014which will make reaching certain parts of the world more difficult.\n My hope is that the vaccine we have 18 months from now is as close to \u201cperfect\u201d as possible. Even if it isn\u2019t, we will continue working to improve it. After that happens, I suspect the COVID-19 vaccine will become part of the routine newborn immunization schedule.\n Once we have a vaccine, though, we still have huge problems to solve. That\u2019s because\u2026\n  In order to stop the pandemic, we need to make the vaccine available to almost every person on the planet. We\u2019ve never delivered something to every corner of the world before. And, as I mentioned earlier, vaccines are particularly difficult to make and store.\n There\u2019s a lot we can\u2019t figure out about manufacturing and distributing the vaccine until we know what exactly we\u2019re working with. For example, will we be able to use existing vaccine factories to make the COVID-19 vaccine?\n What we can do now is build different kinds of vaccine factories to prepare. Each vaccine type requires a different kind of factory. We need to be ready with facilities that can make each type, so that we can start manufacturing the final vaccine (or vaccines) as soon as we can. This will cost billions of dollars. Governments need to quickly find a mechanism for making the funding for this available. Our foundation is currently working with CEPI,  ...\n Part of those discussions center on who will get the vaccine when. The reality is that not everyone will be able to get the vaccine at the same time. It\u2019ll take months\u2014or even years\u2014to create 7 billion doses (or possibly 14 billion, if it\u2019s a multi-dose vaccine), and we should start distributing them as soon as the first batch is ready to go.\n Most people agree that health workers should get the vaccine first. But who gets it next? Older people? Teachers? Workers in essential jobs?\n I think that low-income countries should be some of the first to receive it, because people will be at a much higher risk of dying in those places. COVID-19 will spread much quicker in poor countries because measures like physical distancing are harder to enact. More people have poor underlying health that makes them more vulnerable to complications, and weak health systems will make it harder for them to receive the care they need. Getting the  ...\n With most vaccines, manufacturers sign a deal with the country where their factories are located, so that country gets first crack at the vaccines. It\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s what will happen here. I hope we find a way to get it out on an equitable basis to the whole world. The WHO and national health authorities will need to develop a distribution plan once we have a better understanding of what we\u2019re working with.\n Eventually, though, we\u2019re going to scale this thing up so that the vaccine is available to everyone.

It\u2019s also dropping the price of the service by more than 50% and giving developers the option to run it on relatively low-performance virtual machines that will start at $0.08 per hour.\n In today\u2019s announcement, Microsoft\u2019s Nik Molnar points out that the company learned that most developers who used Visual Studio Online thought of it as being much more than simply an editor in the browser.\n   \u201cTo better align with that sentiment, and the true value of the service, we\u2019re renaming Visual Studio Online to Visual Studio Codespaces. (It\u2019s true what they say, naming is hard!) Do you want a great experience working on your long-term project? Do it in a Codespace. Need to quickly prototype a new feature or perform some short-term tasks (like reviewing pull requests)? Create a Codespace! Your Codespaces are simply the most productive place to code.\u201d\n The new pricing will go into effect on May 19, the first day of Microsoft\u2019s (virtual) Build developer conference. These are pretty significant price drops, down from $0.45 per hour to $0.17 for a machine with 4 cores and 8 GB of memory, for example (you also incur some relatively minor storage costs of $0.0088 for using a 64 GB SDD, too).\n  Molnar also points out that a lot of developers don\u2019t need quite that much power, so the company is now introducing a Basic plan with a 2-core machine and 4 GB of RAM for $0.08 per hour. Best I can tell, these will go live for around $0.24 per hour today and then see a price cut on May 19, too. Why not launch it at the reduced price? Only Microsoft knows, so we asked and will update this post once they tell us.\n Typically, this is the kind of announcement Microsoft would make at its annual Build developer conference. And while some other companies have decided to fully scrap their events and aren\u2019t even hosting a virtual conference, Microsoft is moving full steam ahead with its Build conference in the middle of May. I expect in the near future we\u2019ll hear more about how that event will play out.\n Correction:  we mistakenly attributed the Microsoft blog post to\u00a0 Microsoft\u2019s Scot Hanselman, but it was Nik Molnar who wrote it.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:56:30", "tags": "microsoft,visual,\u4ef7\u683c", "title": "Microsoft\u7684Visual Studio Online\u73b0\u5728\u662fVisual Studio Codespaces\uff1b\u964d\u4ef750%", "title_en": "Microsoft\u2019s Visual Studio Online is now Visual Studio Codespaces; 50% price drop", "transed": 0, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/microsofts-visual-studio-online-code-editor-is-now-visual-studio-codespaces-and-gets-a-price-drop/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["microsoft", "visual", "\u4ef7\u683c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "fd02ffdee6db11f3587038c5b6ea3833.png", "infoid": 1000177, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6628\u665a(4\u670830\u65e5)\u516c\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u8d1f\u503a\u8868\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e03\u5929\u91cc\u53c8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86830\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u51e0\u5468\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u7684\u653e\u7f13\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0e\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u4ecd\u7136\u5feb\u5f97\u4ee4\u4eba\u773c\u82b1\u7f2d\u4e71\u3002\n\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e03\u5929\u7684\u201c\u5370\u949e\u201d\u89c4\u6a21\u4e3a830\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u800c\u524d\u4e00\u5468\u4e3a2050\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u622a\u81f33\u670825\u65e5\u7684\u4e03\u5929\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u4e3a5860\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e00\u5468\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u8d44\u4ea7\u8d1f\u503a\u8868\u7684\u589e\u957f\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u7531620\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u56fd\u5e93\u5238\u6784\u6210\u3002\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u8fd8\u7565\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u56de\u8d2d(+7.02\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143)\uff0c\u5411\u5176\u7279\u6b8a\u76ee\u7684\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684\u5b57\u6bcd\u6c64\u989d\u5916\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8610\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8d37\u6b3e\uff0c\u5e76\u53c8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86290\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u592e\u884c\u8d27\u5e01\u6389\u671f\u3002\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u652f\u6301\u8bc1\u5238(MBS)\u4e0a\u635f\u5931\u4e86177\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u524d\u4e00\u5468\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8fd1300\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n\u5e02\u573a\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e07\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u6062\u590d\u5230\u957f\u671f\u589e\u957f\u7387\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u8d1f\u503a\u8868\u89c4\u6a21\u4f1a\u6709\u591a\u5927\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u56de\u5230\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u7206\u53d1\u524d\u6bcf\u6708600\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u589e\u957f\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e5f\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9065\u8fdc\u7684\u68a6\u60f3\u3002\n\u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u7ebf\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u65b0\u6587\u7ae0\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u662f\u5426\u5e0c\u671b\u6536\u5230\u901a\u77e5\uff1f/\u5355\u51fb\u6b64\u5904\u514d\u8d39\u8ba2\u9605\u3002", "note_en": "Data released last night (April 30th) reveals that the Fed\u2019s balance sheet grew by another $83 billion over the past seven days, a considerable slowdown compared to recent weeks, although still a blindingly fast pace compared to pre-Coronavirus times.\n   The past seven days\u2019 $83 billion of \u2018printing\u2019 by the Fed compares to $205 billion the week prior and a peak of $586 billion for the seven day period ending March 25th.\n   Most of the growth in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet over the past week consisted of $62 billion of treasury securities. The Fed also slightly increased its repos (+$702 million), made an additional billion dollars of loans to its alphabet soup of special purpose vehicles, and did another $29 billion in central bank currency swaps.

"note_en": "Companies shouldn&#39;t be afraid or embarrassed of their dev environments. It is what they use to do stuff, and what every single software person will end up using, so they should be forthcoming about it! This way, if it sucks, people can see it as a warning and stay far away.\n  Company A has you write code on your Mac laptop. Then you start up a large virtual Linux box on the laptop and it NFS-mounts your homedir from the Mac over a virtual interface. It has to download tens of GBs of packages to do this the first time, and it periodically (and unpredictably) downloads large updates. This spins up the laptop&#39;s fan. It then starts up &#34;mini me&#34; versions of other services and then starts yours. These versions are not maintained and not initialized, and must have  ...\n Most of the commands you run to do your job happen at a shell prompt on your Mac. Your experience is defined by the Mac UI and window controls.\n Company B has you write code on your Mac laptop. You then drop into a continuous build tool and type your username in four times. You click a button and about five minutes later, you are assigned a very large virtual machine running somewhere else - thousands of miles away. This machine does not share any files with your Mac. You can access the Internet from it, but you can&#39;t obtain the sources from your company&#39;s repos (&#34;git clone ...&#34;) since they are hosted with a vendor and  ...\n Most of the commands you run to do your job happen at a shell prompt on your Mac. Your experience is defined by the Mac UI and window controls.\n Company C issues you a Mac laptop and a Linux workstation. The Linux workstation is installed at your desk along with two large LCD screens on arms, a full-size keyboard and mouse. It runs a version of a popular Linux distribution which has been extended with support for the peculiarities of the corporate network and infrastructure. Your workstation primarily runs a web browser and your development environment - X terminals, editors, that sort of thing. You can talk to prod through a proxy,  ...\n Most of the commands you run to do your job happen in a shell within an X terminal on a regular Linux box which is right there at your desk. Your experience is defined by whatever window manager and/or desktop environment you want to run.\n Company D issues you a Mac laptop and a Linux development server in a data center within 1000 miles of your location. Your Mac is used for web browsing and e-mail, and you ssh to your development server. The server itself is almost the same hardware as production servers, and is physically near many of them. You run your editor and builds on that host directly. It can talk to production -- as you. It can see limited versions of prod services that you could also talk to. You can build a package  ...\n Most of the commands you run to do your job happen in a shell inside a ssh session to your development box inside a Mac terminal app on your laptop. Your experience is defined by the Mac UI and window controls.\n Company E is like company D: you get a Mac laptop and a Linux development server somewhere within 1000 miles. However, you can get away with running a Linux virtual machine on the Mac. You are allowed to teach it how to participate in the Kerberos scheme, and thus can connect directly from that VM to your development server. Everything else is the same.\n Most of the commands you run to do your job happen in a shell inside a ssh session to your development box inside an X terminal on a virtualized Linux box which is on a Mac laptop which is right there on your desk. Your experience is largely defined by whatever window manager and/or desktop environment you want to run. You can still use the Mac native side of things, like by opening the lid of the laptop or by plugging in a second display.\n Company F hands you a pile of parts resembling a computer and lets you scrounge around to find someone to burn a CD of your favorite Linux distribution. You are able to use your scissors to back out the latch to the data closet because you know there is a box of Ethernet patch cords on the floor. You put the box together, install whatever you want, plug into the network, do DHCP, start X and a browser, and are able to hit the internal company site and start learning how it works.\n Your entire job consists of doing things in the browser and sshing to other machines to do things, so every command happens in a shell in an X terminal on that Linux box right there at your desk. Your experience is completely defined by whatever you decided to load on the machine. You run whatever WM/DE you feel like running that day.\n Company G hands you a Linux laptop and puts a BIOS lock on it. It powers up and shows a terrible text-mode prompt for a password. It is a user-mode password, such that you can&#39;t get into the BIOS to change things or remove the lock. You are told that if it powers off, you will need to come back to them to have them type it in again. You are not put into group wheel or the sudoers file, so you can&#39;t change what is installed on the machine. The fact that your job (uniquely) grants  ...\n Your entire job doesn&#39;t matter. Nobody does any engineering there anyway. Attempting to build new things or change anything which already exists is met by extreme pushback from people who control their established domains with iron fists.\n I have worked at all of these companies.

"note_en": "Let&#39;s imagine a scenario in which you are dealing with JSON in your application and you want to store it in your database. You let out a heavy sigh and think, &#34;I guess I am going to have to add something besides my favorite DB (Postgres) to my  architecture. I wish I could just keep using PostgreSQL.&#34;\n You start thinking that instead of one problem, now you have many. You&#39;re probably going to have to learn a new data query syntax, data creation statement, install new software, and worst of all for you as an app developer, running some new server in production. Now rather than developing your features, you are going to be spending valuable time learning, experimenting, and praying.\n Well my friend, today is the day your wishes come true. In the blog post we will talk a little about how you can use PostgreSQL for all your JSON needs. We will also point you at some free learning  resources so you can  dig in deeper.\n  Since 9.2, released in September 2012, PostgreSQL has had a JSON type. This original JSON type was not much more than just a simple storage field that let you dump JSON into your database table. It is just a simple text field that checks to make sure your JSON is well formed. Other than that it doesn&#39;t do much and I would not recommend using it.\n With PostgreSQL release 9.4 in December 2014, a JSOB type was added. Though I joke that the B stands for better it really stands for Binary. When you put JSON data into a JSONB column, in addition to checking for well formed JSON, you now have the ability to indexing and query and retrieve portions of the document. Generally for all your work you should use JSONB unless you have a compelling reason not to. Here are a couple of nice discussions on the  tradeoffs and  choosing JSON versus  JSONB  ...\n   {\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;person&#34;:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;first_name&#34;: &#34;Steve&#34;,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;last_name&#34;: &#34;Pousty&#34;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0},\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;score&#34; : 100,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;status&#34; : &#34;Awesome&#34;,\u00a0\u00a0 &#34;best_feature&#34; : &#34;humbleness&#34;}\n  Once you put it in a JSOB column named  json_content (and make a  GIN Index for faster queries) you can do all sorts of fun things. Please note that I will be using the JSONB navigation and function syntax found in PostgreSQL version 11. There was a major improvement to JSON document navigation and querying in version 12 which will be the focus of another blog post.\n    The  #&gt; or  #&gt;&gt; is the JSON path navigator with the difference being  #&gt; returns JSON and the  #&gt;&gt; returns the JSON text value.\n  Using that same document navigation syntax, we can then combine that with the containment check. Just like the name sounds, we will check to see if the stored JSON contains the JSON we are looking for. For example, if we wanted to return only those records that had a status of awesome we would write:\n    operator looks for JSON that contains the JSON on the right side of the operator.  The best part of working with JSON in PostgreSQL is that you get to leverage all the normal SQL you already love along with these JSON functions. SQL processing can be used to greatly reduce the amount of code you need in your application. For example, here is the query to get all the distinct status types in the table:\n   So if you are intrigued by what you saw here and want to learn more here are some  great resources (if I do say so myself).\n We have an  online tutorial to get your started with JSON in PostgreSQL. It is free and available 24/7 and\u00a0 I also did \u00a0a live stream walking through the material above.\n Let us know  @crunchydata what you think of the material! I would also love to hear about how YOU are using JSON with PostgreSQL.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:56:04", "tags": "postgresql,\u7528\u4e8e,json", "title": "\u5c06PostgreSQL\u7528\u4e8eJSON\u5b58\u50a8", "title_en": "Using PostgreSQL for JSON Storage", "transed": 0, "url": "https://info.crunchydata.com/blog/using-postgresql-for-json-storage", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u7528\u4e8e", "json"]}]
