"note_en": "Mining giant BHP Billiton is poised to destroy at least 40 \u2013 and possibly as many as 86 \u2013 significant Aboriginal sites in the central Pilbara to expand its $4.5bn South Flank iron ore mining operation, even though its own reports show it is aware that the traditional owners are deeply opposed to the move.\n In documents seen by Guardian Australia, a  BHP archaeological survey identified rock shelters that were occupied between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago and noted that evidence in the broader area showed \u201coccupation of the surrounding landscape has been ongoing for approximately 40,000 years\u201d.\n BHP\u2019s report in September 2019 identified 22 sites of artefacts scatters, culturally modified trees, rock shelters with painted rock art, stone arrangements, and 40 \u201cbuilt structures \u2026 believed to be potential archaeological sites\u201d.\n  Under section 18 of the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act, the traditional owners \u2013 in this case the Banjima people \u2013 are unable to lodge objections or to prevent their sacred sites from being damaged.\n They are also unable to raise concerns publicly about the expansion, having signed comprehensive agreements with BHP as part of a native title settlement. BHP agreed to financial and other benefits for the Banjima people, while the Banjima made commitments to support the South Flank project.\n But the Banjima native title holders told the WA government in April they did not want any of the 86 archaeological sites within the project area to be damaged, saying the \u201cimpending harm\u201d to the area \u201cis a further significant cumulative loss to the cultural values of the Banjima people\u201d.\n Guardian Australia has seen correspondence from an archaeological advisor to the Banjima to the WA government in April this year in which they say they \u201cin no way support the continued destruction of this significant cultural landscape\u201d but \u201care equally aware\u201d they cannot formally object to the section 18 application.\n This letter in April followed one sent in December 2019 in which the native title holders said: \u201cThe significance of the sites impacted by the notice to Banjima people is such that Banjima people cannot and do not support the destruction of those sites as proposed by the Notice as to do so would be inconsistent with their cultural obligations to protect those sites.\u201d They would \u201csuffer spiritual and physical harm if they are destroyed\u201d.\n They said they were \u201cworried about the cumulative impact of so many sites being the subject of a single notice for destruction and that not one of the sites is deemed worthy of protection in situ by BHP\u201d.\n BHP\u2019s 2019 report said \u201cit had taken into account the views and recommendations provided by the Banjima representatives during the consultation and inspection\u201d but decided it was  \u201cnot reasonably practicable for BHP to avoid the eighty-six (86) potential archaeological sites\u201d at the South Flank mine development area.\n BHP suggested the areas could be excavated, salvaged or deconstructed but also noted the Banjima did not want any of the objects or heritage values within the 86 potential archaeological sites to be removed or relocated.\n BHP also offered to engage \u201ca suitably qualified expert to digitally capture the extent and form of each stone arrangement using DPGS and drone footage, with a view of creating a three-dimensional computer model and video\u201d.\n \u201cAny cultural material salvaged as part of these programs shall be stored in the cultural repository at the BHP Mulla Mulla Heritage Office until a different location is nominated by the Banjima people,\u201d the company\u2019s assessment report said.\n All 86 sites identified in the BHP application were assessed by the Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee, which controls the protection of heritage, but only 40 were considered by the ACMC to meet the threshold required to be a protected heritage site, despite the Banjima saying all 86 should be protected.\n  \u201cWe speak regularly with the Banjima community and have reiterated our commitment to working closely with them through the lifecycle of the South Flank development to minimise impacts on cultural heritage,\u201d a spokesman for BHP said.\n  The revelations follow the  apology last week by the chief executive of Rio Tinto iron ore, Chris Salisbury, for destroying the rock shelter in Juukan Gorge, which was blown up in mining works at the Brockman 4 iron ore mine near Tom Price in the Pilbara region on 24 May,\u00a0 saying there had been a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d with traditional owners\u00a0the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people.\n On Tuesday, more than 300 protesters gathered in face masks outside the company\u2019s offices on St George\u2019s Terrace in Perth to call for Salisbury\u2019s resignation.\n  Protest organiser Robert Eggington, a Noongar man, said  Rio Tinto had exploited the weakness of WA\u2019s 48-year-old Aboriginal heritage laws, which have been under review for two years.\n \u201cThey used that against the people and then turned and blamed [it on] misunderstandings between the company and the custodians of that site,\u201d Eggington said.\n Rio Tinto received ministerial consent under the WA legislation to destroy the site in 2013. That legislation\u00a0 does not give traditional owners the right of appeal.\n BHP has said the South Flank project will create around 2,500 construction jobs, more than 600 ongoing operational roles and generate many opportunities for Western Australian suppliers. The project is expected to produce ore for more than 25 years.\n The Western Australian minister for Aboriginal affairs, Ben Wyatt, confirmed he approved the South Flank expansion on 29 May, three days after the destruction of Juukan Gorge made global headlines.\n But he has urged BHP to cooperate with the Banjima under what are now \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d.\n \u201cAs with any agreement, some circumstances can change including the understanding of heritage values of particular sites.\n \u201cI urge parties to such agreements to cooperate on management of those changed circumstances.\n \u201cI have asked BHP to work with Banjima to do what it can to avoid or minimise the impact on this site, regardless of the section 18 approval.\u201d\n Wyatt said impending reforms to the WA Aboriginal heritage legislation will end the section 18 process and reinforce the need for land users to negotiate directly with traditional owners.\n Wyatt said he wants to see impacts to Aboriginal sites \u201climited to the practical extent possible\u201d but that he is \u201ccautious about governments interfering in private negotiations by registered native title holders\u201d.\n Companies such as BHP make significant investment decisions on the basis of these agreements with native title groups, which in turn generate substantial benefits, he said.\n \u201cOur first principle is to seek to avoid impacts to cultural heritage, through planning and ongoing consultation with traditional owners. This approach is supported by the individual land use agreements we establish in partnership with traditional owners, and is in addition to meeting the requirements of Aboriginal heritage protection laws\u201d a BHP spokesman said.", "posttime": "2020-06-11 11:08:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u571f\u8457,bhp", "title":

"note_en": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014\u00a0Nearly three months after Louisville Metro Police officers fatally shot\u00a0Breonna Taylor\u00a0in her apartment, the department  has released the incident report\u00a0from that night.\n  The four-page report lists the time, date, case number, incident location and the victim&#39;s name\u00a0\u2014 Breonna Shaquille Taylor\u00a0\u2014 as well as the fact that she is a 26-year-old\u00a0black female.\n The report redacts Taylor&#39;s street number, apartment number and date of birth\u00a0\u2014 all of which have been widely reported already.\n And it lists as her injuries, &#34;none,&#34; even though\u00a0she was shot at least eight times\u00a0and died on her hallway floor in a pool of blood, according to attorneys for her family.\n It lists the charges as &#34;death investigation\u00a0\u2014 LMPD involved&#34; but checks the &#34;no&#34; box under &#34;forced entry,&#34; even though officers used a battering ram to knock in Taylor&#39;s apartment door.\n    It also lists under the &#34;Offenders&#34; portion of the report the\u00a0three officers who fired in Taylor&#39;s apartment, fatally shooting her \u2014 Sgt. Jon Mattingly, 47; Myles Cosgrove, 42; and Brett Hankison, 44.\n The\u00a0&#34;narrative&#34; of events March 13 says only &#34;PIU investigation.&#34; And the rest of the report has no information filled in at all.\n  Taylor was at her apartment around 12:40 a.m. local time when the three plainclothes officers used a no-knock search warrant signed by District Judge Mary Shaw\u00a0to enter her home as part of a narcotics investigation.\n Officers say they announced their presence, but Taylor&#39;s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, and several neighbors say they did not. Walker has said he thought intruders were trying to break in\u00a0and fired a warning shot that struck Mattingly in the leg.\n  Mattingly, Hankison and Cosgrove are\u00a0on administrative reassignment pending the investigation. The detective who requested the warrant, Joshua Jaynes,\u00a0has also been reassigned, LMPD announced Wednesday.\n \u201cThis document is proof that LMPD continues to make a mockery of transparency,\u201d said Jon Fleischaker, counsel for the Louisville Courier Journal of the USA TODAY Network\u00a0and one of the principal authors of the state\u2019s Open Records law that requires the release of public documents in all but extremely rare circumstances.\n  \u201cUnder the Fischer administration, there has been a consistent policy and practice of refusing to tell the public what is going on with the police, regardless of how inappropriate the officer conduct has been,&#34; Fleischaker said.\n  With debate about police reform taking place nationwide, Fleischaker said city leaders\u00a0&#34;are refusing to honor their obligations to disclose the basic information necessary for the citizens of Louisville to have a meaningful debate about what needs to change.&#34;\n  &#34;How can we even seriously debate police reform if the police won\u2019t engage and the mayor won\u2019t stand up to them?&#34; he said.\n The Courier Journal is suing LMPD,\u00a0seeking the immediate release of the department&#39;s investigative file\u00a0in\u00a0Taylor&#39;s shooting.\n  The Courier Journal also filed an appeal with the state attorney general\u2019s office in May to object to open-records decisions Louisville public agencies made refusing to release records underlying the Taylor case, including the incident report, 911 calls made in the incident and Taylor&#39;s autopsy report.\n The city has since released Walker&#39;s 911 call\u00a0\u2014 but only after\u00a0an attorney for Taylor&#39;s family gave it to news media\u00a0hours earlier.", "posttime":

"note_en": "We are pleased to announce the technology preview of QUIC+HTTP/3 for NGINX at a  special open source repository. This is pre\u2011release software, based on the  IETF QUIC draft and is maintained in a development branch, isolated from the stable and mainline branches. The release is the culmination of several months of initial development, and is now ready for interoperability testing, feedback, and code contributions.\n   In this fast\u2011paced world, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been a remarkably stable constant for over two decades. The  HTTP/1.1 standard was published in\u00a01999 and has become the ubiquitous transport protocol for web applications and APIs. The protocol remained the same over the next\u00a021 years despite the huge changes to the apps and services it is used to transport.\n At this point the astute reader may be asking, \u201cbut what about HTTP/2?\u201d. This is a very good question. The  HTTP/2 standard was published in\u00a02015, and has seen steady adoption to the point where\u00a0 45% of Internet\u2011facing websites support HTTP/2. However, this statistic belies the reality that the use of HTTP is quite different on the public Internet compared to the \u201c last mile\u201d (the runtime infrastructure).\n The reality of modern Internet infrastructure is that HTTP/2 is very rarely deployed end to end. It is designed to solve problems that manifest most clearly on the public Internet, where latency is unpredictably high and  problems with one HTTP request can delay subsequent requests. Inside the application runtime environment\u00a0\u2013 for example, a public cloud or private data center\u00a0\u2013 latency is low, network reliability is excellent, and the ability to directly inspect HTTP/1.1\u2019s text\u2011based transport stream is of more value than the efficiency of HTTP/2\u2019s binary transport stream.\n HTTP/2 has by and large improved the user experience on browsers and mobile devices, because it\u2019s well suited to the environment between the client and the \u201cedge\u201d of the runtime infrastructure. At that point it is typically proxied into a runtime environment where HTTP/1.1 is used. The edge is most likely to be a CDN provider, or a reverse\u2011proxy load balancer that handles traffic entering the runtime environment.\n  This hybrid approach of using HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 to deliver websites and applications works well. So why propose yet another new protocol, HTTP/3?\n The primary innovation of HTTP/2 is to multiplex several HTTP requests over a single connection that uses TCP as the low level transport. Unfortunately, TCP has inherent limitations that constrain the performance and user experience of website and applications. The  TCP standard was originally published in\u00a01981 and has been astonishingly successful as a general\u2011purpose transport protocol. However, when you multiplex several independent requests over the same connection, they all become subject to the reliability of that connection. If a packet for just one request is lost, all of the multiplexed requests are delayed until the lost packet is first detected and then retransmitted.\n HTTP/3 is based on the  QUIC transport protocol, which is designed specifically to support multiplexed connections without depending on a single TCP connection. QUIC instead uses  UDP as the low\u2011level transport mechanism for moving packets between client and server, and implements a reliable connection upon which HTTP requests are made. Notably, QUIC also incorporates TLS as an integral component, not as an additional layer as with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.\n  The goal of QUIC is to provide a high\u2011performance, high\u2011reliability, high\u2011security transport protocol for HTTP/3 (although QUIC is also suitable for non\u2011HTTP traffic). Semantically speaking, HTTP/3 itself is very similar to HTTP/2. However there is no explicit versioning of HTTP\u00a0\u2013  https://www.example.com might support one or more of HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3. How do clients (web browsers) know which version of HTTP to use?\n The versioning issue first arose with the introduction of HTTP/2, which solved it by using the TLS handshake to detect whether the client and server are capable of communicating over HTTP/2. That way, the client knows how to talk to the server before the connection is even established. However, QUIC\u2019s use of UDP instead of TCP as the underlying transport protocol presents a new challenge\u00a0\u2013 how does the client know which type of connection to request initially, TCP or UDP? The solution is for the client to establish a TCP connection for the initial HTTP request. The response from a server that supports HTTP/3 includes the   Alt-Svc  header to specify the UDP port on which it is listening for HTTP/3 traffic. In addition, the browser remembers which sites support QUIC to eliminate the overhead of the   Alt-Svc\u2013based discovery method.\n  Today we announce the initial release of the official QUIC and HTTP/3 implementation for NGINX, the http_v3_module. This is a technology preview and must be considered experimental\u00a0\u2013 it is not for production use. At the time of writing, the  QUIC standard is not yet finalized, and this initial release is implemented against a subset of the current draft.\n Following several months of design and development, the http_v3_module is ready for interoperability testing. We also welcome general feedback and code contributions. Note that the http_v3_module is not available in the mainline development branch; because it is still experimental, it is in a dedicated development branch at   https://hg.nginx.org/nginx-quic.\n Note that this QUIC+HTTP/3 implementation is all\u2011new, and not related to the patch provided by Cloudflare as part of its  quiche project.\n  server {\r listen 443 ssl; # TCP listener for HTTP/1.1\r listen 443 http3 reuseport; # UDP listener for QUIC+HTTP/3\r\r ssl_protocols TLSv1.3; # QUIC requires TLS 1.3\r ssl_certificate ssl/www.example.com.crt;\r ssl_certificate_key ssl/www.example.com.key;\r\r add_header Alt-Svc &#39;quic=&#34;:443&#34;&#39;; # Advertise that QUIC is available\r add_header QUIC-Status $quic; # Sent when QUIC was used\r}\n For more information about building NGINX from the   nginx-quic repo, and recommended configuration, see the  README. In addition, a demo site with the http_v3_module enabled is available at  https://quic.nginx.org/. From here you can check whether your browser already supports QUIC, and compare HTTP/3 interoperability with your own build of   nginx-quic. Given the draft status of QUIC, you may need to use development versions or the very latest builds of the common browsers to enable a QUIC connection.\n Thanks for trying   nginx-quic, and we look forward to hearing your feedback in the comments section, or on our  mailing lists.", "posttime": "2020-06-11 10:50:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Introduced for 1911 and continued in production through at least  1916-1917\u00a0is what I consider to be one of the best and simplest fans of the period, the Robbins &amp; Myers &#34;List 1404&#34; model 14, three versions of which are shown in the photo above. \u00a0A similar 16&#34; fan was also made, the List 1411 and 14110 which, other than the fan size, was basically the same as the 12&#34; model.\n  Left to right are the original 1911 model (one of my favorite fans and often a daily user) with a guard using a square back ring. \u00a0This is the same cage used on later production versions of the R&amp;M &#34;lollipop&#34; fan. \u00a0An early lollipop fan is shown below. \u00a0For 1912 the guard of the 1404 was changed to a two ring cage using a round wire back ring and the same common flag cage badge that R&amp;M had already been using for a few years. \u00a0For the final few years of the 1404 the List No. became 14040 and was, basically, the same fan as the 1404 but with a felt covered base plate. \u00a0The last year of production was actually  after R&amp;M introduced their new drawn steel fan motors for 1916 and appears to have had a cage with the new, smaller solid cage badge as shown on the right of the photo above. \u00a0\u00a0The fan on the right has its original felt on the base. \u00a0All three fans have their original paint, finish on the brass, and head wires.\n  Was the 14040 continued in production for a year or more after the stamped steel motor modles came out or am I seeing the result of some cage substitutions? \u00a0I have found some new information from the Toronto, Canada  The\u00a0Electrical News, below, that shows the old cast iron R&amp;M fans were sold alongside the new 1916 stamped steel models. \u00a0This would account for the small round badge on the latest List 1404 models. \u00a0It appears that the 12&#34; and 16&#34; fans for 1916, both the old cast iron models and new stamped steel models, used the old flag badge while only the smaller (stamped steel) fans used the new round solid cage badge. \u00a01917 models, both iron and steel had the newer round cage badge and a brass cage. \u00a0 For 1918 and possibly 1919 R&amp;M&#39;s larger fans had a wrapped steel cage followed by a welded steel cage c.1920.\n     One can closely, if not exactly, date the List 1404 and 14040 models as follows:\n      Robbins &amp; Myers was one of the oldest fan companies, having begun the manufacture of direct current ceiling fans in 1897 in Springfield, Ohio under the ownership of Chandler Robbins and James Myers. \u00a0Direct current desk fans were added in 1899. \u00a0After acquiring a patent from Charles Eck for an oscillating fan mechanism, R&amp;M put into production their unique DC &#34;lollipop&#34; oscillator in 1904, followed a few years later by an AC version. \u00a0A sheet brass disk in front of the fan was acted upon by the air from the fan causing the fan to oscillate back and forth. \u00a0Stops on the base of the fan were contacted by a pin at the bottom of the lollipop shaft to shift the disc to the other side, resulting in the fan oscillating to the other side.\n    R&amp;M had been making only direct current fans until 1908 when their first AC fans were introduced. \u00a0Their new 12&#34; and 16&#34; AC fans were made by Westinghouse and re-badged for R&amp;M. \u00a0They were virtually identical to the Westinghouse &#34;tank&#34; fans but with the R&amp;M open flag cage badge. \u00a0With Westinghouse&#39;s impending introduction of a new drawn steel fan motor in 1912 it is likely that R&amp;M found it would no longer have a source of AC fan motors, prompting them to design their own AC fan motor, the &#34;List 1404&#34; and varients.\n  The 1404 did away with the mechanical start switch of the previous R&amp;M AC fans made by Westinghouse. \u00a0The 1404 incorporated three speeds with a good speed separation between high and medium and medium and low. \u00a0They also run pretty quietly and are an easy fan to live with for daily use.\n       The much more commonly used &#34;open flag&#34; cage badge as used on most 1404 and 14040 fans is shown in the top photo, right, and was used on 12&#34; and 16&#34; R&amp;M fans through 1916. \u00a0The photo below, right, is of the smaller round badge used during the last year of R&amp;M cast iron fan motor production, presumably 1917. \u00a0 I have both the 12&#34;\u00a0R&amp;M 14040 and a 16&#34; R&amp;M 11530 oscillator\u00a0with the round cage badge.                    Robbins &amp; Myers motor tags from the 1911-1917 era have little information on them; the &#34;List No.&#34; (the first two digits are the &#34;model number&#34;) and the voltage and frequency, as well as direct or alternating current. \u00a0That is all you got- no serial numbers or patent dates or other information was included. \u00a0If there were patents pending they never were on the motor tags of these fans as an actual date.         Yes, R&amp;M did make Direct Current versions of the 1404 and 14040. \u00a0Above is the motor tag of a later version of the List 1505 with felt base plate making it a List 15050. \u00a0Note the 30 volts on the tag. \u00a0A standard 110 v. DC version is a List 1500, or List 15000 with the felt base.  Most information for R&amp;M fans is hard to come by. \u00a0I have not seen any catalogs of their earlier fans so that I might see what voltages and frequencies they made fans for or the other models that were made in this series of the Models 14 and 15.   Right: \u00a0The 1911 1404 on the left in the photo and the c.1915 14040 on the right. \u00a0Not too many fan makers pin striped their fans but R&amp;M was one who did well into the 1920s. \u00a0Usually a pair of double stripes was used, hand applied, around both the motor and the base. \u00a0A single stripe was applied to the sides of the trunnion. \u00a0 R&amp;M&#39;s finish was second to none in this period and their black japan finish was very durable. \u00a0It can usually be cleaned up using acetone and a rag and Q-tips with no harm to the japan. \u00a0That finish is really tough!  Click on photos in the blog to see a larger version.     There are two wing bolts on these fans. \u00a0Here you can see them both painted black; one for the tilt adjustment on the left upper side of the trunnion and a smaller wing bolt, also painted black on this fan, at the bottom center of the trunnion to adjust for side to side position of the fan. The tilt adjustment must be the easiest to use and most secure locking of any fan ever made. \u00a0A wonderful design of a simple part.\n  What is unusual to me is that a brass wing bolt should indicate that the bolt is made of brass and, one would think, a black painted wing bolt would indicate an iron wing bolt. \u00a0Also, one would think that brass is earlier and iron is later. \u00a0The 1911 model has both wing bolts of lacquered brass. \u00a0On the newest fan discussed here, the one with the small, solid cage badge, the large wing bolt is steel but the small one is brass, painted black. \u00a0The fan in the center of the first photo and the DC fan both have a brass large bolt but a black steel small bolt. \u00a0Such minor details are not uncommon for old fans. \u00a0The companies probably used what they had on hand.\n      Rear bearing caps or covers were never used on these fans. \u00a0On the earlier models without the felt base plate a tan fiber cover was screwed to the base which helped to protect the switch and wiring. \u00a0Three rubber feet protected the surface the fan was placed on.\n    Below are comparison photos of the early (1911) cage with square back ring and the later cages with the two round rings. \u00a0The double ring cages only differed among the years used (1912- 1917) by having the smaller solid badge on the  1917 cages.\n         Cage struts and clips as shown to the right\u00a0were made of stamped steel in all years and did not differ. \u00a0Attaching screws were solid brass.\n Blades were highly polished and lacquered. \u00a0Cages and other brass parts were probably dipped and lacquered and not highly polished as is commonly seen on modern restorations. \u00a0I have never figured out what the &#34;dipped&#34; part of dipped and lacquered is but will often see that term used in fan catalogs of the period.\n     Some photos, below, of the 30 volt Direct Current, List 15050 fan. \u00a0After some cleaning of the commutator and brushes and lubricating the oil cups, this fan runs very well. \u00a0I connect the power cord to my variac to reduce the voltage to 30 volts or less and plug it into a power strip socket in which I have installed a bridge rectifier which gives a close approximation of direct current voltage. \u00a0The bridge rectifiers are small, about $4 each, and are easy to hook up. \u00a0They can be installed inside the base of most early fans if there is room in the base and the fan can then be plugged into a regular house wall outlet.\n    While the base of the DC models is the same (the switch is not the same) the motor is larger in diameter and deeper, with different construction. \u00a0 I would say the DC has a better looking motor than the AC versions. \u00a0The tubes sticking out from the rear sides of the motor are the brush holders. \u00a0Earlier versions differ somewhat in having a screw-on knurled cap.   There were no typical two prong plugs as we know them today until about 1917. \u00a0Instead fans and other electrical appliances used &#34;attachment plugs&#34; as shown below allowing the fan to be connected to a light socket. \u00a0In the nineteen teens wall outlets began to be installed in buildings but the attachment plugs persisted into the 1930s, by then separable from a standard two prong plug.          Venting on the DC fan motors is very different from the AC motors. \u00a0A few large openings on the DC motors contrast with many smaller vent holes on the AC motors.  Oil cups are made of brass and have spring loaded felt wicks in them to wick oil to the bearings. \u00a020 wt. non-detergent is the proper oil to use on old fans.      What about rarity and availability of these R&amp;M fans? \u00a0I would say they are a bit uncommon but not too hard to find. \u00a0 Certainly they are much less common than even the 1902-07 GE pancakes, or the GE &#34;Big Motor Yoke&#34; and &#34;Small Motor Yoke&#34; \u00a0models of about the same period. \u00a0DC models are fairly rare and hard to find which makes sense since Direct Current power disappeard for the most part from our country fairly early. \u00a0I bet a lot of DC fans met their fate in the scrap drives of the two world wars.\n  Thanks goes to a noted collector of R&amp;M fans for providing me with this scan of an R&amp;M catalog page for the 1911 year List 1404 series of fans. The only numbers I have encountered are the List 1404 and 1411 fans for the common 110 volt 60 cycle current.     What came after the List 1404 and other CAST IRON R&amp;M fans?   Up until 1916 all R&amp;M desk fans were made of cast iron. \u00a0Beginning in 1916 R&amp;M had new designs made of drawn steel, a feature that Westinghouse pioneered for the 1912 model year. \u00a0It appears that the cast iron models were still available for a year or two after 1916 but, predominately, their fans would be of the new pressed steel construction.  The new offerings included a 6&#34; two speed fan with four blades, a three speed 9&#34;, 5 blade fan- Models 26 and 27 (AC and DC), and 12&#34; and 16&#34; 6 blade fans- Model 21 and 22 (AC and DC non-oscillators) as well as oscillating fans, Models 24 and 25 (AC and DC). \u00a0The model numbers were the first two digits of the &#34;List Number&#34; which is the important number in describing R&amp;M fans.  For several years the 12&#34; and 16&#34; fans were available only with 6 blades. \u00a0A brass cage was used on 1916-17 fans with a change to wrapped steel cages for one or two years more before the cages went to welded steel. \u00a0 Before the welded steel cages appeared the four blade fans returned and the 6 blade may have been discontinued. \u00a0As R&amp;M information is hard to come by I will leave it at this for now until I can update the details. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pictured at left is a 1916 R&amp;M 6 wing oscillating Model 24 (List 2404). \u00a0This is probably the last year for the large, open flag cage badge to be used and followed in 1917 by the smaller, solid, round flag cage badge, still on a brass cage and with a 6 wing blade. \u00a0 \u00a0            (To be continued)\u00a0\u00a0I have not yet covered or even mentioned that there are 16&#34; versions of the 1404; the List 1411, 14110, etc. \u00a0The size difference is about the only notable difference although the first year model 1411 (1911) used a square back ring cage but with a front (round) ring that the 12&#34; fan did not use, it had no front ring on the cage.   8-24-16  R&amp;M Flag cage badges- new reproductions: Often the original cage badge is missing from early R&amp;M fans. \u00a0It was a thin stamped sheet brass &#34;flag&#34; as you see pictured in this blog. \u00a0 Fortunately for those who have a missing badge, which is a very common occurrence, AFCA member Darryl Hudson makes excellent die stamped reproductions that are nearly impossible to tell from the originals. \u00a0Darryl made a run of flag badges then ran out. Fortunately he did made another batch around 2014 and I think they are still available. \u00a0If you need a badge don&#39;t dally, they may sell out again and you don&#39;t know if they will be made again. \u00a0Darryl does excellent work. \u00a0He makes the badges in the original thickness of .010 and the same in a thicker and slightly more durable 0.015&#34; thickness for the same price of $40.00 each plus shipping. \u00a0 That&#39;s a bargain for the quality and intricateness of his badges.

a doctor blamed the technology for a problem with his vision.\n Glasses should correct the issue but would normally only &#34;be prescribed to 40-year-olds&#34;, he tweeted.\n The Association of Optometrists said it had not seen evidence that VR headsets could cause permanent eye damage.\n Facebook-owned Oculus states in its handbook that one in 4,000 may suffer &#34;dizziness, seizures, eye or muscle twitching.&#34; It recommends users suffering these symptoms discontinue using the headset and see a doctor.\n  Doctors have previously warned that virtual reality, which is the computer-generated simulation of a real or imaginary environment, can cause eye strain because the brain is forced to process visual stimuli in a different way to normal.\n And users have complained about nausea and dizziness when using headsets, which is generally put down the the way a user perceives space around them, leading to motion sickness.\n Danny Bittman, who has worked as a virtual reality developer for four years, suggested it could have affected his eyesight.\n &#34;Just had my first eye doctor visit in three years. Now I&#39;m very worried about my future VR use. I have a new eye convergence problem that acts like dyslexia. The doc, a headset owner, is convinced my VR use caused this. He said &#34;these glasses we usually prescribe to 40-year-olds&#34;, he tweeted.\n  He went on to describe the problem: &#34;My eyes jump when I read things like a screen or books. I&#39;ve always had a small level of this but it&#39;s greatly intensified now. It&#39;s also linked to headaches and vertigo.&#34;\n He said that the issue was about &#34;prolonged use&#34;, and admitted that he could spend up to six hours a day wearing a headset, split into 30-minute sessions.\n Ceri Smith-Jaynes, from the Association of Optometrists, told the BBC: &#34;We currently do not have any reliable evidence that VR headsets cause permanent deterioration in eyesight in children or adults. There have been some studies looking into the effects of short-term use of VR headsets only; these did not reveal a deterioration in eyesight.\n &#34;However, some people do suffer from temporary symptoms such as nausea, dry, irritable eyes, headache or eyestrain. &#34;\n But she did have some advice about usage: &#34;If you spend all day in VR without a break, you&#39;ll need time to readjust to the light and the different visual environment of the real world. I would suggest taking a five-to-ten minute break each hour, using that time to move about, blink and look out of a window, or take a short walk.\n &#34;The number of hours of headset use a person can comfortably tolerate will vary depending on your binocular vision status (ask your optometrist) and the task you are doing in VR.&#34;\n VR headsets have been adapted to help improve eyesight. Start-up GiveVision created a device called SightPlus, that aims to restore vision to people whose eyesight has deteriorated beyond repair by projecting a video of the real world into the working part of the retina.\n A clinical trial at Moorfields Eye Hospital suggested it improved eyesight in 59 of the 60 participants, with nearly half saying they would wear the device for watching TV, reading or going to the theatre. The firm is partnering with Sony to develop its next device.", "posttime": "2020-06-11 10:17:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

with family in a simple board game at home, rolling the dice introduces a bit of chance or &#34;luck&#34; into every game. We expect dice to be fair, where every number has equal probability of being rolled.\n    But a new study shows this was not always the case. In Roman times, many dice were visibly lopsided, unlike today&#39;s perfect cubes. And in early medieval times, dice were often &#34;unbalanced&#34; in the arrangement of numbers, where 1 appears opposite 2, 3 opposite 4, and 5 opposite 6. It did not matter what the objects were made of (metal, clay, bone, antler and ivory), or whether they were precisely symmetrical or consistent in size or shape, because, like the weather, rolls were predetermined by gods or other supernatural elements.\n  All that began to change around 1450, when dice makers and players seemingly figured out that form affected function, explained Jelmer Eerkens, University of California, Davis, professor of anthropology and the lead author of a recent study on dice.\n &#34;A new worldview was emerging -- the Renaissance. People like Galileo and Blaise Pascal were developing ideas about chance and probability, and we know from written records in some cases they were actually consulting with gamblers,&#34; he said. &#34;We think users of dice also adopted new ideas about fairness, and chance or probability in games.&#34;\n  &#34;Standardizing the attributes of a die, like symmetry and the arrangement of numbers, may have been one method to decrease the likelihood that an unscrupulous player had manipulated the dice to change the odds of a particular roll,&#34; Eerkens said.\n     Dice are not common finds in archaeological sites. They are typically found in garbage, domestic areas, or cemeteries, and frequently are recovered as lone objects in a site, Eerkens said. Many are not accurately dated.\n After looking at hundreds of dice in dozens of museums and archaeological depots across the Netherlands, Eerkens and his co-author, Alex de Voogt, of the American Museum of Natural History, New York, were able to assemble and analyze a set of 110 carefully dated, cube-shaped dice. Their findings were published in the journal  Acta Archaeologica in December.\n  -- Dice made before 400, or in Roman times, are highly variable in shape, size, material and configuration of numbers.    -- When dice reappear around 1100 they are predominantly in the &#34;primes&#34; configuration, where opposite numbers tally to prime numbers (1-2; 3-4; 5-6), a numbering style that was also popular in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt. Early medieval dice also tend to be quite small relative to their Roman predecessors.\n     -- Around 1450 the numbering system quickly changed to &#34;sevens&#34; where opposite sides add up to seven (6-1; 5-2; 3-4). Dice also became highly standardized in shape, and also were made larger again. Standardization may be, in part, a byproduct of mass production.\n Eerkens said he studied dice because they are a convenient item in which to isolate the function from the style, as opposed to other artifacts found in archaeological sites, such as arrowheads, a functional item used for hunting. &#34;A lot of artifacts we study as archaeologists conflate the two... . We know for dice they are purely stylistic.&#34;\n The study also shows that dice, like many material objects, reflect a lot about people&#39;s changing worldviews, Eerkens said.\n  The researchers conclude in their article, &#34;Gamblers may have seen dice throws as no longer determined by fate, but instead as randomizing objects governed by chance.&#34;\n    Materials provided by   University of California - Davis.

I will no longer be following my earlier model of posting. I will write what comes to me during these difficult times. If you like any of my past writings and want to help keep this project going, please subscribe below or become a patron at  patreon.com/ForwardBlog\n   The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) will most likely be a short lived communal project of local socialists and anarchists in Seattle. But it\u2019s fascinating lesson in how to build communal societies and what benefits they can provide to a large group of people. After a week of tough protesting against the Seattle PD, local anarchists began to create roadblocks in and around the Capitol Hill area of Seattle once the department retreated from their East Precinct. CHAZ was established only after the Seattle PD abandoned that precinct. Capitol Hill is a posh, LGBTQ community where a lot of younger urban professionals already lived. On June 8th, they officially declared a six block radius under their complete control and gave it a new name, The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), aka \u201cFree Capitol Hill.\u201d Anarchists used the moniker \u201cFree Capitol Hill\u201d in homage to the \u201cFree Derry\u201d sign erected in the Bogside neighborhood of the Northern Ireland city of Derry, which became an embattled city during the Troubles. These developments are amazing when you consider that in just two weeks, three different police precincts were either abandoned or burned down (2 in Minneapolis, 1 in Seattle). We\u2019ve never seen this before in America and it does signal what can be possible through numbers and sheer determination. Now, obviously the goal is not to take over police stations, but to defund departments and attempt to rebuild policing from the ground up. Some may toe the line of \u201creform\u201d but anarchists and socialists in this country know that much more than that is needed. CHAZ is a local experiment, but one worth taking lessons from and it\u2019s a breath of fresh air during a time of inhumanity.\n      On June 7, the mayor of Seattle, Jenny Durkan announced that no more tear gas can be used and only de-escalation techniques going forward. That night and the night of June 8th, her department decided to use tear gas anyway because like most mayors in the country, they have no control of their brutish and unaccountable police departments. Video surfaced late on the night of June 8th of tear gas filling an entire street in the Capitol Hill district. This video went viral, but what didn\u2019t go viral was the Seattle PD\u2019s tactical retreat that happened later in the night and the subsequent complete control that was gained in the district by local anarchists and socialists. By the morning of June 9th, that six block radius was in their complete control. Roadblocks were erected, signs were put up and artists came in to put their stamp on the community. As far as internal governance goes, there is none of course. It\u2019s an experiment in de-centralized governance operating as a  de facto anarchist region. It\u2019s probably most similar to Freetown Christiania which is an intentional commune in the borough of Christianshavn in the city of Copenhagen, Denmark.\n      Tents have been pitched next to the abandoned police station and local medics, artists, civil servants and restauranteurs have flooded the zone in order to provide their services. It\u2019s estimated that about 200 residents are currently occupying CHAZ and have come from all over the city of Seattle. On June 9th, they established the \u201cNo Cop Co-op\u201d, which hands out free water, hand sanitizer, snacks, masks and kebabs. An intersection was cordoned off to provide \u201cteach-ins\u201d which are basically soapbox lectures on how to run a co-op and how to build effective communes. Other speakers educate people on police brutality and protesting tactics moving forward. A large screen outdoor cinema was set up with a large projector and portable toilets were donated from the Seattle Transportation Department. Additionally, homemade riot shields are being made and distributed to everyone in the commune. Going forward, local zoners also hope to build a cohesive labor movement that can spread across the Northwest. National  organizations like CODEPINK support the commune stating \u201cpolice are the real instigators.\u201d Local activists in CHAZ have decided to use a pink umbrella as their symbol to show solidarity with those in Hong Kong whose techniques have been copied by protestors all over the world. As mentioned earlier, street medics have flooded the zone and play a major role. Many of them are college educated and have experience being in the field during protests. They also have created medic tents in order to deal with the future conflicts that they will surely have with the police.\n      On June 9th, CHAZ representatives  released a list of demands that were authored by many of the collective voices in the zone. Most of them are extremely realistic and can be accomplished if Seattle actually had a representative government instead of one that works for Amazon. The list of demands falls under four categories: economics, education, the justice system and health and human services. The authors stated further that the zone was on land taken from the local Native American Duwamish people over a century ago. The Pacific Northwest has a long history with native tribes and the collective voices of the zone realize that. Additionally, they have requested no violence be used in attempts to remove the zoners and that they be allowed to operate in a communal structure in order to \u201cshow the country what is possible through collective voices.\u201d CHAZ has been praised by the IWW\u2019s  Industrial Worker publication as an effective way to distribute badly needed social services. The irony behind the creation of CHAZ is that austerity measures have been put in many American cities since the CARES bailout back in March. This is expected during crises and it\u2019s not acceptable to those not just in CHAZ but protesting within the BLM movement. Austerity has been a prime focus during these protests because while police departments across the country see their budgets increase every year, every other line item of public services continue to be cut. Anarchists in the zone realize they need to do more planning going forward. They have already began deputizing scouts and are working on expanding their perimeter even more. Smoking areas have been designated and local marijuana growers have flooded the zone to provide free marijuana. The anti-capitalist views of the inhabitants will create an atmosphere of brainstorming that will only serve the commune for the better going forward. As an example of this, many have began talking about black-owned banks, divesting from local corporations and prison reform. Local activists even gave a soapbox speech  criticizing the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), and how their representatives in conservative state legislatures write laws without \u201cany clue\u201d as to who they represent. The opportunity is there to create a flourishing commune in a short term project that will ultimately likely be destroyed at some point. The main goal is to provide a glimpse for Americans what can be possible though communal action when you operate outside of the system of government that many Americans take for granted. This is not a country that is used to communal action and most citizens probably don\u2019t even know the definition of a co-op. Kshama Sawant is a Seattle City Council member and member of the Trotskyist Socialist Alternative Party (SA). She visited the zone on June 9th and asked the residents to turn it into a community center for restorative justice. She agreed that there needs to be long term goals and that the method of going beyond policing (police abolition) needs to be analyzed and discoursed in the mainstream. Sawant did suggest caution though on pushing the city too far. She, along with the residents want to avoid future violence if the police do eventually move in to tear down the commune. The development of CHAZ is a real time education in community organizing and anarchist alternatives. Amazon and Boeing weren\u2019t going to provide the people of Seattle with basic life necessities. Those in CHAZ hope they can demonstrate that social services can be provided in a vacuum. They have stated they will continue to build the commune and will continue until they are forced out.

CodeArtifact eliminates the need for you to set up, operate, and scale the infrastructure required for artifact management so you can focus on software development. With CodeArtifact, you only pay for what you use and there are no license fees or upfront commitments.\n  AWS CodeArtifact works with commonly used package managers and build tools such as Maven and Gradle (Java), npm and yarn (JavaScript), pip and twine (Python), making it easy to integrate CodeArtifact into your existing development workflows. CodeArtifact can be configured to automatically fetch software packages from public artifact repositories such as npm public registry, Maven Central, and Python Package Index (PyPI), ensuring teams have reliable access to the most up-to-date packages.\n  IT leaders can use AWS CodeArtifact to create centralized repositories for sharing software packages approved for use across their development teams. CodeArtifact\u2019s integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides them with the ability to control who has access to the packages. Further, CodeArtifact\u2019s support for AWS CloudTrail gives leaders visibility into which packages are in use and where, making it easy to identify packages that need to be updated or removed. CodeArtifact also supports encryption with AWS Key Management Service so customers can control the keys used to encrypt their packages.\n  To learn more about AWS CodeArtifact check out the  blog,

"note_en": "\u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready,\u201d Alex says. My husband is wearing his green scrubs under a hospital-issued jacket with his name embroidered on the upper left side, over his heart: Dr. Alexander Fortenko, Emergency Medicine. My eyes catch on the red pressure ulcer that\u2019s been slowly growing on the bridge of his nose.\n He looks at me expectantly. He\u2019s waiting for me to recite the incantation I do before each shift. \u201cI love you,\u201d I say. \u201cBe safe. Stay away from sick people.\u201d It\u2019s our talisman \u2014 an impossible ask that I hope, against all rationality, will keep him safe. It worries me that he\u2019s come to rely on it.\n   I walk into the hospital and head straight for the doctor\u2019s offices and lockers. I sanitize my hands once I\u2019ve opened the door, and then I take my goggles out of my backpack. These are reusable, and we only get one pair \u2014 typically, I clean and resanitize these every few patients, about five or six times in a twelve-hour shift. Then, I put my backpack away into my locker. I make sure I don\u2019t touch anything else except what I absolutely must. While I\u2019m still wearing a surgical mask \u2014 the same one I\u2019ve worn from home \u2014 I walk into the ER.\n The first thing I do is grab an n95 mask from the clerk, who usually keeps track of how many each person has gotten throughout the day. During the peak in New York a few weeks back, when supplies were scarce, the clerk would have a running tally of who\u2019d received a mask, and when. I wash my hands and then I put my n95 on. I need to make sure it\u2019s tightly sealed. It digs painfully into the pressure ulcer on my nose, and my eyes start to water. I practice taking a few breaths \u2014 air comes in strained gulps, like I\u2019m sucking it through a straw. That\u2019s good. It\u2019s only safe when it\u2019s difficult to breathe. I put a surgical mask on top, to preserve the n95, and then I clean my goggles again, and put them on. This is the last time I touch my face.\n Now I begin cleaning my work station with bleach wipes, to avoid possible contamination from the person who has previously used it. It\u2019s ritualistic and thorough \u2014 the same thing, every shift. The first thing I clean is the chair \u2014 the back of it, then the seat, then any handles. I move on to the desk \u2014 the top and underneath, too. Then my keyboard \u2014 between each letter and row. Then I turn it over and clean the back as well. I move on to the mouse, taking care to make sure I also clean the cord and the wheel. The phone is next. I clean again between the numbers and take special care with the receiver. Finally, I wipe down the monitor and any surrounding walls or partitions that I might touch incidentally while working.\n I log in and start to review my patient load. Every patient is presumed COVID. A patient with appendicitis? COVID. Stroke? Also COVID. Leg pain? COVID. We\u2019ve learned that every encounter is a potential exposure. So, despite New York being past peak, we can\u2019t afford to be anything less than extremely vigilant.\n Before I see my first patient, I wash my hands and put on a fresh pair of gloves. Then I put on a yellow disposable gown over my scrubs, and then a second pair of gloves, making sure that I catch the sleeve of the yellow gown into this second pair, so that my wrists are not exposed. I check my mask and goggles again to make sure they\u2019re snug, and then I go into the room.\n  For the next twelve hours, I am home alone with our 21-month-old son, Ronan. I busy myself with my own work while Ronan is napping. When he wakes up, we play and read. I clean the apartment in fits and starts timed to waves of anxiety: I put the toys away, knowing they\u2019ll be pulled out and abandoned again 10 minutes later. I am the Sisyphus of his toy basket. Then, I wipe down commonly touched surfaces, vacuum, and bleach the bathtub where Alex showers.\n Around mid-afternoon, I begin dinner and try to make enough for a few meals \u2014 I\u2019ve become proficient in lasagnas and stews, anything that reheats well. At 5 PM, I have my third coffee of the day and I put on some music for Ronan. I answer work emails while he dances. I\u2019m engaged with him almost constantly, which makes it difficult to be anywhere but in the present. It\u2019s a blessing that keeps me from worrying about Alex.\n At 6:57 PM, our neighbor in the adjacent building exits onto his balcony with his saxophone and plays Take Me Out to the Ball Game , followed by God Bless America . He\u2019s an older gentleman, probably in his early eighties, with a penchant for accessorizing with bright pink \u2014 usually a cap, sometimes a cozy-looking cardigan. Ronan bangs on our window and yells \u201cBavo!\u201d gleefully \u2014 he still can\u2019t pronounce his Rs. He\u2019s acknowledged with a wave and a bow from the balcony.\n   Once I\u2019m in the room with a patient, I try to maintain a six foot distance. Depending on the situation, I\u2019m usually alone. Sometimes, if the patient is critically ill, there may be a nurse or other staff, but for the most part we try to minimize how many people go in, to conserve PPE. I approach the patient to examine them \u2014 I listen to their lungs, I look at the back of their throat, I examine their abdomen for tenderness, and I also look at their legs. We tailor our routine exam for each individual complaint \u2014 but these days, the stories all sound similar. A standard history and exam takes about five to ten minutes.\n When I\u2019m done seeing the patient, I pull off my yellow gown and, with it, my top layer of gloves. I use the bottom set of gloves to open the door. I close the door shut (or pull the curtain, depending on where the patient is) and take off the remaining pair of gloves. Then, I head to the sink to wash my hands. If the patient was coughing or if I spent a lot of time in close proximity, I usually change the procedure mask and wipe down my goggles. Then, it\u2019s on to the next patient.\n  I\u2019ve learned that the more I repeat an action or a routine, the better I become at carrying it out successfully and avoiding what we all fear right now, contamination.\n It\u2019s OCD-like behavior that I think everyone in the hospital has picked up, to a certain degree, from this pandemic. I don\u2019t deviate from it, at all. I know it\u2019s what keeps me safe.\n  She says it to be funny, I think. She knows it\u2019s an impossible ask. But I\u2019m not sure my wife realizes the weight on my shoulders \u2014 the responsibility I feel to stay safe. I haven\u2019t hugged my family in over two months \u2014 anything to keep them from contracting a virus that could kill them.\n  A patient comes in, DNR/DNI. Brought in by ambulance. Super sick. Blood oxygen level in the 40s. Weak, dehydrated \u2014 so dehydrated the nurses can\u2019t get an IV in them. We have to do an IO \u2014 intraosseous \u2014 drill a needle into their shinbone in order to hydrate and medicate them. It\u2019s a painful procedure but they don\u2019t wince \u2014 don\u2019t react to the pain because they\u2019re so sick.\n Because of the Do Not Intubate order, there\u2019s not much we can do. A BiPAP machine is briefly an option, but candidates have to be lucid enough to coordinate their breathing with the device. This patient doesn\u2019t have the mental capacity to handle that. We also know that BiPAPs aerosolize the virus \u2014 spreading COVID-19 through the air, putting the whole ER at risk.\n As I\u2019m discussing the patient\u2019s treatment plan with my team, their partner arrives. They ask to be allowed into the patient\u2019s room because they know what\u2019s coming. They sense it. We all do.\u00a0 The spouse tells me it\u2019s time to stop fighting \u2014 to make the patient comfortable. I look into the room \u2014 the patient is breathing really fast, clearly in distress, so we give them a little morphine to help ease their breathing.\n I huddle with my team and we decide that as long as the partner understands the risk of being in the room, they should be allowed inside. We gown them up, explain safety procedures, and let them in. They sit by the bed and wait, and we watch from the window.\n We watch the patient\u2019s blood oxygen numbers plummet, aware of what will happen \u2014 any second now. Their partner sits by them and we watch their lips move \u2014 we can\u2019t make out any words, just a gentle and soothing murmur.\n  The alarm blares in the room and throughout the ER and, within seconds, one of our nurses goes in to turn it off. I am on her heels \u2014 re-gowned, to call the time of death.\n I hold the partner\u2019s gloved hand as they cry inconsolably. Unimaginable: the grief one must feel as they sit helplessly by, watching their loved one grow paler \u2014 watching life slowly leave their body. How unfair it feels to withhold human comfort from them in these circumstances.\n I feel my grip relax on their hand and I pull them in for a hug. The nurse in the room with me watches for a beat and then joins me quietly on the other side, interlocking her arms around the grieving \u2014 a temporary shield.\n  \u201cLet\u2019s cheer for papa!\u201d I hand Ronan a stainless steel lid from one of our smaller pots and a wooden spoon, and we march around our small kitchen, making quite the racket.\n I wonder, in a brief moment of panic, if and how he\u2019ll remember this when he\u2019s older.\n By 7:30 PM, Ronan has had dinner and bathed. We FaceTime with both sets of grandparents, read one last book and at 7:45, he\u2019s in bed for the night.\n At around 8 PM, I get a text from Alex: \u201cDone. Coming home.\u201d\n This half an hour of solitude is the hardest part of my day. All the fears and anxieties I\u2019ve been warding off finally have a chance to declare themselves, and they do. Greedily, with vengeance \u2014 What if today is the day Alex contracted the virus? What if he gets very ill? What if I get very ill? Who will take care of Ronan?\n This, followed by some painfully morbid mental accounting: It\u2019s probably better if I die. Alex is stronger than I am. He\u2019ll be able to rebuild. He\u2019ll give Ronan a happier childhood.\n I indulge myself in this doomsday thinking because it\u2019s priming my brain for the worst case scenario. If one of us does get sick, it won\u2019t come as a total shock \u2014 it won\u2019t totally debilitate me. At least that\u2019s what I tell myself. I need to think about these things and I can\u2019t tell anyone else about them because \u2014 well, who would want to spend that time with me, underwater? I feel as if I\u2019ve been bracing for a hit for months now. I\u2019m exhausted.\n All Alex and I do is talk about coronavirus. And in spite of all our discussions about numbers, trends, patients, death toll, and vaccines, we seldom talk about what he sees at the hospital. And we never talk about the really scary things, afraid that by breathing them aloud we might call their attention to us.\n  When Alex finally gets home, he takes his scrubs off outside our front door and stuffs them into a plastic bag that he ties off tightly. He takes his hospital clogs off and leaves them outside, along with his backpack and coat.\n We asked our next door neighbor, a lovely 60-something-year-old woman who is battling cancer, if this was alright with her. \u201cOf course, of course,\u201d she said, her eyes filling with tears when we explained that we were afraid Ronan would touch them unwittingly. He gets into everything these days.\n Once inside, Alex greets me briefly and jumps into the shower where he spends a good fifteen minutes decompressing and sanitizing himself. I wait for him quietly in the bathroom doorway and listen. Nothing \u2014 no loofah scrubbing, no water splashing, and no raspberries from almost-empty shampoo bottles. He\u2019s standing still in the tub, exhausted. I wonder what he\u2019s thinking.\n   I don\u2019t usually push. Some days, vague is what I need. He seems to instinctively sense that.\n But something is different now. I am tired of talking around this thing. I am tired of being brave. I am tired of pretending that I don\u2019t want to ask him to quit. Just don\u2019t go in. Stay here with us, stay safe. I have thought it a million times and yet, I can\u2019t bring myself to give voice to it. I just want to hold on to him, even if it\u2019s selfish.\n   She can sense when I\u2019m lying to her, but she needs me to tell her everything is okay. So I do.\n I close my eyes in the shower and little frames of the day come back. Some details are more vivid than others \u2014 some patients stick with you long after they\u2019re gone. It\u2019s hard to know what your brain will latch on to, what will cause you pain down the road.\n The way someone\u2019s eyes look at the exact moment that their heart has stopped beating. The sometimes gurgling, sometimes raspy sound someone makes when they can\u2019t breathe. The way that blood pools and stagnates at the back of the body, a latitudinal divide emerging, almost like half of it has been dipped imperfectly in purple dye.  Lividity, it\u2019s called.\n I try to wash it all away. Death feels too close to the surface, like if I scrub hard enough, I can push back the fear \u2014 the rawness, the animalism. I tell myself what I need to hear to make it palatable \u2014  they were older, they lived a good life. I forget what I say when the patient is young. I find something to make it less devastating.\n This is what I get stuck on: I am one of the last people someone sees before they\u2019re intubated. Many of them have difficulty breathing, but they\u2019re awake. I watch them struggle with the decision: If we don\u2019t intubate, you\u2019ll most likely die. If we do intubate, your chance of survival is only slightly better. Either way, this may be the last time you\u2019re ever lucid. You have to say goodbye,  just in case. They grapple with uncertainty. They\u2019re alone. Their eyes widen, fill with tears.  What should I do?They want to know.  What would you do?\n I wish I could say that I remember all of their faces, that I check their charts afterwards to see whatever happened to them \u2014 did they make it? But there are too many.\n  Out of the shower, armorless, he seems frail. Just human. Has he been eating enough? No, that\u2019s not what I think. I think: Have I been feeding him enough? Because isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re doing here \u2014 manning our lookout towers? Effectively dispatching our responsibilities. Am I doing my part? Am I taking care of you well enough? That\u2019s what we do. We take care of each other; we\u2019re sharp, we\u2019re present, we\u2019re on it. The margin for error is zero.\n     \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d my wife wants to know. I go in for a hug, but stop myself.", "posttime": "2020-06-11 09:41:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5ac1\u7ed9,er,\u75c5\u4eba", "title":

"note_en": "If you or someone you know is facing eviction, CNBC Make It would like to hear from you. Please email money reporter Alicia Adamczyk at alicia.adamczyk@nbcuni.com.\n Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. was experiencing what housing experts and advocates deemed an eviction crisis.  More than 2 million people face eviction each year, far more than the number of people who faced foreclosure at the height of the 2008 mortgage crisis.\n  Experts expect the eviction crisis to get far worse in the coming months. The Covid-19 economic recession has hit renters especially hard. They\u00a0 make up a disproportionate share of service sector jobs, an industry that has been decimated as a result of the coronavirus shutdowns.\n In fact, between March 25 and April 10 of this year,  nearly half of renters aged 18 to 64 reported that they were having trouble paying their rent or utilities, were  food insecure or couldn&#39;t afford needed medical care, according to the Urban Institute.\n Thousands of tenants have been missing rent payments over the past few months. People of color have fared worse than white renters due to the\u00a0 disproportionate job loss in their communities, the Urban Institute reports. About 25% of black and Latino renters  reported not paying or deferring rent in May, compared to 14% of white renters.\n To keep people in their homes,\u00a0the federal government banned evictions in federally assisted properties through July 25, and some cities and states,  including Massachusetts, New York\u00a0and Michigan, put their own  temporary eviction moratoriums in place. But  many of those bans begin expiring this month\u00a0depending on the state, according to Princeton University&#39;s Eviction Lab, which tracks evictions across the country.\n Plus, the  extra $600 per week in federal unemployment benefits is  set to expire at the end of July. That extra money is &#34;what has been allowing many people who have lost their jobs to continue paying rent,&#34; Solomon Greene, a senior fellow in housing policy at the Urban Institute, tells  CNBC Make It. Coupled with the end of eviction moratoriums, the U.S. is likely to experience an uptick in evictions nationwide in the coming weeks.\n  Evicting people in the middle of a global health crisis puts them at greater risk of contracting and spreading Covid-19, turning &#34;a catastrophe into an apocalypse,&#34; Aaron Carr, founder and executive director of the Housing Rights Initiative, tells CNBC Make It.\n &#34;A lot of people could be on the streets,&#34; says Carr. &#34;Especially in places like New York City that already have a homeless problem, it could turn into a homeless nightmare.&#34;\n Eviction also has long-term \u2014 in some cases, multi-generational \u2014 financial consequences for individuals and families, Alieza Durana, a writer with the Eviction Lab, tells CNBC Make It. It can ruin a tenant&#39;s credit for many years, making it harder for them to find a new place to live. It also takes a  mental and emotional toll\u00a0on those affected, and hits minority communities,  particularly women of color\u00a0and  their children, especially hard.\n  &#34;The human toll that an eviction takes on a person and family and community is really devastating,&#34; says Durana, noting that tenants who are evicted often experience  job loss and higher rates of depression, among other issues.\n  &#34;Housing instability has huge health consequences even when we&#39;re not facing a pandemic,&#34; says Greene. &#34;Exposure risk is so much more amplified and worsened when you can&#39;t shelter in place because you don&#39;t have a place to shelter.&#34;\n  If you are facing an eviction, Carr suggests contacting a  nonprofit tenant organization in your area and your elected officials as soon as you can.\n That said, the crisis requires a large-scale government response, according to experts.\u00a0If state and local governments don&#39;t step in to help soon,  there will be a &#34;tsunami of evictions and a spike in homelessness&#34; nationwide, that will &#34;devastate&#34; not just individuals and their communities, but the economy broadly, Dinae Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, says in a statement to CNBC Make It.\n &#34;Now more than ever, housing is health care,&#34; says Yentel. &#34;Ensuring housing stability for all is both a moral imperative and a public health necessity.&#34;\n  Activists have been pushing for reforms and\u00a0policies\u00a0like increased rental\u00a0assistance\u00a0and\u00a0rent\u00a0cancellation\u00a0since the start of the pandemic, though states have been slow to move and the federal government has done little to support tenants. One measure the government could take immediately, says Durana, is to ensure that renters who qualify for federal rental assistance actually get the funds. Currently,  only one in four eligible recipients receive it.\n Increased resources for tenants, like providing advocates and legal support to tenants facing eviction, would also help keep people in their homes in the years and decades to come, says Greene. He also advocates for targeted relief measures, like allocating roughly $100 billion to cover rent for low income tenants through the crisis, and mortgage relief for landlords.\n There&#39;s no good data set currently available to estimate how many people may face eviction because of Covid-19, says Greene. But the Eviction Lab has already noticed an increase in eviction filings since some moratoriums have been lifted, says Durana. And unlike with the mortgage crisis, that lasted years, all of the tenants facing eviction could find themselves without a home in just a couple of months after the moratoriums lift.\n Greene hopes the current crisis will spur structural changes in the housing sector, including stronger protections for tenants nationwide, like homeowners experienced after the 2008 foreclosure crisis.\u00a0&#34;We&#39;re overdue to have that kind of reform in the renters space, particularly for low income renters,&#34; he says.\n At the very least, housing experts and advocates hope the federal government will put in place a uniform, nationwide eviction moratorium instead of the ad hoc bans currently in place. In the middle of a pandemic that has claimed the lives of over 113,000 Americans, keeping people in their homes should be a priority.\n And the  HEROES Act, which was passed by the House in May but has so far stalled in the Senate, includes an extension of the nationwide moratorium on eviction filings, hearings and executions for 12 months, which Tara Raghuveer, director of KC Tenants, a tenants rights group in Kansas City, tells CNBC Make It is a &#34;great start&#34; to prevent renters from losing their homes.\n &#34;I do think any one eviction at this point is inhumane. It comes at potential human cost, the cost of life, if people are forced out of their homes,&#34; says Raghuveer. &#34;I don&#39;t think even one eviction should be happening.&#34;", "posttime":

"note_en": "Tesla (TSLA) has become the world\u2019s most valuable automaker \u2013 surpassing Toyota \u2013 as its stock pushes to a new high at $1,000 a share.\n As its stock price rose, the California-based automaker has been rapidly climbing the ranks of the most valuable automakers in the last few years.\n It\u2019s hard to directly compare Tesla to other automakers because the company is more than an automaker due to its growing energy division and its tech-like approach to the automotive business.\n But most of its revenue currently comes from selling cars, which mostly makes the company an \u201cautomaker\u201d on a market capitalization standpoint.\n In 2018,  Tesla had a surge in stock price that made it more valuable than several major automakers, but it was short-lived after a difficult year on the stock market for the electric automaker.\n Now Tesla\u2019s stock (TSLA) has been on another run since late last year and today, the stock hit another high of over $1,000 per share.\n It raised Tesla\u2019s market valuation to over $180 billion \u2013 surpassing Toyota to become wold\u2019s most valuable automaker (via\u00a0 Top 25 Automakers by Market Cap\u00a0by u/brandude87):\n  To be fair, Tesla didn\u2019t just achieve that through its own performance but also declines in valuation from virtually all other automakers.\n  The Japanese automaker lost as much as 20% of its value during the global pandemic, but it has still recovered most of that loss.\n  In 2010, Toyota invested $50 million in Tesla and they brokered a heavily discounted sale of the Nummi factory, which is now Tesla\u2019s Fremont factory.\n The automaker  sold its stake in Tesla for a good profit back in 2017, but it was still only a fraction of what it would be worth today.\n  I am long TSLA and I am glad to see the market recognize that it is a successful growing company, but I think it\u2019s getting a bit out of control \u2013 like the rest of the stock market.\n There are millions of people without jobs and Tesla is showing clear signs of weak demand in virtually every market except in Asia.\n I am still confident about Tesla\u2019s longterm prospect, but this quarter is going to be a rough one and yet, Tesla\u2019s stock is hitting new highs. It\u2019s weird.\n Apparently, I am not the only thinking that since it was just a month ago when Elon said the stock was too high and it was trading at $760 a share back then.\n  You\u2019re reading Electrek\u2014 experts who break news about  Tesla,  electric vehicles, and  green energy, day after day.
