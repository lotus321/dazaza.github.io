"note_en": "In late February, when the stock market was beginning to fall over coronavirus fears, President Donald Trump held a briefing at the White House  to reassure people that there was little chance of the virus causing significant disruption in the United States.\n  \u201cI want you to understand something that shocked me when I saw it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe flu, in our country, kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me.\u201d\n  His point was to suggest that the coronavirus was no worse than the flu, whose toll of deaths most of us apparently barely noticed.\n  In early April, as social distancing measures began to succeed in flattening the curve in some parts of the country, an  influential forecasting model revised the number of American deaths from coronavirus that it was projecting by summer downward to 60,400, and some people again began making comparisons to the flu, arguing that, if this will ultimately be no worse than a bad flu season, we should open the country up for business again. (On April 22, the model\u2019s forecast rose to  67,641deaths.)  ...\n  But these arguments, like the president\u2019s comments, are based on a flawed understanding of how flu deaths are counted, which may leave us with a distorted view of how coronavirus compares with it.\n  When reports about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 began circulating earlier this year and questions were being raised about how the illness it causes, COVID-19, compared to the flu, it occurred to me that, in four years of emergency medicine residency and over three and a half years as an attending physician, I had almost never seen anyone die of the flu. I could only remember one tragic pediatric case.\n  Based on the CDC numbers though, I should have seen many, many more. In 2018, over 46,000 Americans  died from opioid overdoses. Over 36,500  died in traffic accidents. Nearly 40,000  died from gun violence. I see those deaths all the time. Was I alone in noticing this discrepancy?\n  I decided to call colleagues around the country who work in other emergency departments and in intensive care units to ask a simple question: how many patients could they remember dying from the flu? Most of the physicians I surveyed couldn \u2019t remember a single one over their careers. Some said they recalled a few. All of them seemed to be having the same light bulb moment I had already experienced: For too long, we have blindly accepted a statistic that does not match our clinical  ...\n  The 25,000 to 69,000 numbers that Trump cited do not represent counted flu deaths per year; they are  estimates that the CDC  producesby multiplying the number of flu death counts reported by various coefficients produced through complicated algorithms. These coefficients are based on assumptions of how many cases, hospitalizations, and deaths they believe went unreported. In the last six flu seasons, the CDC \u2019s reported number of actual confirmed flu deaths \u2014that is, counting flu  ...\n  There is some logic behind the CDC\u2019s methods. There are, of course, some flu deaths that are missed, because not everyone who contracts the flu gets a flu test. But there are little data to support the CDC\u2019s assumption that the number of people who die of flu each year is on average six times greater than the number of flu deaths that are actually confirmed. In fact, in the fine print, the CDC\u2019s flu numbers also include pneumonia deaths.\n  The CDC should immediately change how it reports flu deaths. While in the past it was justifiable to err on the side of substantially overestimating flu deaths, in order to encourage vaccination and good hygiene, at this point the CDC \u2019s reporting about flu deaths is dangerously misleading the public and even public officials about the comparison between these two viruses. If we incorrectly conclude that COVID-19 is \u201cjust another flu, \u201dwe may retreat from strategies that appear  ...\n  The question remains. Can we accurately compare the toll of the flu to the toll of the coronavirus pandemic?\n  To do this, we have to compare counted deaths to counted deaths, not counted deaths to wildly inflated statistical estimates. If we compare, for instance, the number of people who died in the United States from COVID-19 in the second full week of April to the number of people who died from influenza during the worst week of the past seven flu seasons (as reported to the CDC), we find that the novel coronavirus killed between 9.5 and 44 times more people than seasonal flu.  ...\n  From this perspective, the data on coronavirus and flu actually match\u2014rather than flying in the face of\u2014our lived reality in the coronavirus pandemic: hospitals in hot spots stretched to their limits and, in New York City in particular, so many dead that the bodies are stacked in refrigerator trucks. We have never seen such conditions.\n  In that briefing in late February, Trump downplayed the likelihood that the virus would spread significantly in the United States and that extreme measures like closing schools would need to be taken, saying that \u201cwe have it so well under control\u201d and returning again to the flu.\n  \u201cSixty-nine thousand people die every year\u2014from 26 to 69\u2014every year from the flu,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, think of that. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n  We now know that Trump was disastrously wrong about the threat that the coronavirus posed to the United States. But his take that the cited numbers of flu deaths were incredible? On that, he was spot-on.\n  The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not reflect the views and opinions of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital or Harvard Medical

"note_en": "By:  Stephan Zheng,  Alex Trott,  Sunil Srinivasa,  Nikhil Naik,  Melvin Gruesbeck,  David Parkes,  Richard Socher\n Economic inequality is accelerating globally and is a growing concern due to its negative impact on economic opportunity, health and social welfare. Taxes are important tools for governments to reduce inequality. However, finding a tax policy that optimizes equality along with productivity is an unsolved problem. The AI Economist brings reinforcement learning (RL) to tax policy design for the first time to provide a purely simulation and data-driven solution.\n The AI Economist uses a two-level RL framework (agents and tax policy) to learn dynamic tax policies in principled economic simulations. This framework does not use prior world knowledge or modeling assumptions, can directly optimize for any socioeconomic objective, and learns from observable data alone.\n Our experiments show the AI Economist can improve the trade-off between equality and productivity by 16%, compared to a prominent tax framework proposed by Emmanuel Saez, with even larger gains over an adaptation of the US Federal income tax and the free market.\n Without endorsing this particular schedule, it is interesting that the AI Economist implements qualitatively different tax schedules than the baselines, with higher top tax rates and lower rates for middle incomes. Furthermore, it is robust in the face of emergent tax gaming strategies.\n Moreover, the AI Economist is effective in simulations with human participants, achieving competitive equality-productivity trade-offs with the baselines and significantly higher income-weighted average social welfare. This suggests promise in using this approach to improve social outcomes in real economies.\n Our vision for the AI Economist is to enable an objective study of policy impact on real-world economies, at a level of complexity that traditional economic research cannot easily address. We believe the intersection of machine learning and economics presents a wide range of exciting research directions, and gives ample opportunity for machine learning to have positive social impact.\n  Our work fits within a larger context of recent advances in RL. RL has been used to train AIs to win competitive games, such as Go, Dota, and Starcraft. In those settings, the RL objective is inherently adversarial (\u201cbeat-the-other-team\u201d). Machine learning has also been used for the design of auction rules. In this work, we instead focus on the opportunity to use AI to promote social welfare through the design of optimal tax policies in dynamic economies.\n Mastering The Game Of Go Without Human Knowledge.

In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 1706-1715 (2019).\n  Many studies have shown that high income inequality can negatively impact economic growth and economic opportunity. Taxes can help reduce inequality, but it is hard to find the optimal tax policy. Economic theory cannot fully model the complexities of the real world. Instead, tax theory relies on simplifying assumptions that are hard to validate, for example, about the effect of taxes on how much people work. Moreover, real-world experimentation with taxes is almost impossible.\n Literature Review On Income Inequality And The Effects On Social Outcomes. Beatrice d\u2019Hombres, Anke Weber, and Leandro Elia. JRC Scientific and Policy Reports, 2012\n  Income Inequality and Health: What Have We Learned So Far? S. V. Subramanian, Ichiro Kawachi. Epidemiologic Reviews, Volume 26, Issue 1, July 2004, Pages 78\u201391\n  Classic tax theory focuses on people who earn  income by performing  labor. A worker gains utility from income but incurs the cost of labor effort. At some point, the extra utility from additional income does not outweigh the cost of additional effort.\n For instance, working on weekends might earn you more money, but the effort might not be worth it to you.\n A key assumption is that people differ in their  skill level. Low-skilled workers receive a lower hourly wage, and so earn less money than high-skilled workers for the same amount of labor. This leads to inequality.\n  As a policy goal, a government may prefer to tax and redistribute income in order to improve equality. However, higher taxation can discourage work and may particularly affect high-skilled workers. An optimal tax policy optimizes this balance between equality and productivity.\n An illustrative view of how taxes can impact social outcomes. Left: Taxes can improve equality by transferring income. However, taxes can also decrease productivity, because they can discourage work. The AI Economist seeks a tax policy that optimizes this trade-off. The Pareto boundary is the set of maximal trade-offs. Right: Taxes impact productivity (total income, represented by the area of the big squares), and equality (the relative difference in sizes of the smaller squares). In  ...\n A prominent tax framework, proposed by Emmanuel Saez, derives a simple optimal tax formula. However, this formula requires knowing how labor responds to changes in tax rates (\u201celasticity\u201d) and makes strong assumptions, for example, that the economy is static and workers do not gain new skills. Other work has studied dynamic economic systems, but needs simplifying assumptions in order to attain analytical solutions. For an extended overview of related work, see our technical paper.\n Using Elasticities To Derive Optimal Income Tax Rates. Saez, Emmanuel  The Review Of Economic Studies 68.1 (2001): 205-229.\n  The AI Economist is a  purely simulation and data-driven approach to the design of optimal tax policies. It uses a principled economic simulation with both workers and a policy maker (a &#34;planner&#34; in the economics literature), all of whom are collectively learning  using reinforcement learning.\n   The simulation uses a two-dimensional world. There are two types of resources: wood and stone. Resources are scarce: they appear in the world at a limited rate. Workers move around, gather and trade resources, and earn income by building houses (this costs stone and wood). Houses block access: workers cannot move through the houses built by others. The simulation runs this economy over the course of an episode, which is analogous to a \u201cworking career.\u201d\n  A key feature is that workers have different skills . Higher-skilled workers earn more income for building houses, and thus more utility. Building houses also takes effort, which lowers utility. Workers also pay income taxes and the collected tax is redistributed evenly among the workers. Together, these economic factors and the various competitive drivers mean that workers need to be strategic in order to maximize their utility.\n  Our economic simulation produces rich behavior when AI agents (the agents are the workers in the economy) learn to maximize their utility. A salient feature is specialization: AI agents with lower skill become  gatherer-and-sellers and earn income by collecting and selling stone and wood. Agents with higher skill specialize as  buyer-and-builders and purchase stone and wood in order to more quickly build houses.\n  We do not impose such roles or behaviors directly. Rather, specialization emerges because differently skilled workers learn to balance their income and effort. This demonstrates the richness of the economic simulation and builds trust that agents respond to economic drivers. Complex emergent economic behavior has been previously studied in economics through agent-based modeling, but this has largely proceeded without the benefit of recent advances in AI.\n Agent-Based Modeling: Methods And Techniques For Simulating Human Systems.

Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences 99, no. suppl 3 (2002): 7280-7287.\n  An Agent Based Model For Studying Optimal Tax Collection Policy Using Experimental Data: The Cases Of Chile And Italy. Garrido, Nicol\u00e1s and Mittone, Luigi.  The Journal of Socio-Economics 42 (2013): 24-30.\n  Reinforcement learning is a powerful framework in which agents learn from experience collected through trial-and-error.  We use model-free RL, in which agents do not use any prior world knowledge or modeling assumptions. Another benefit of RL is that agents can optimize for any objective.\n In our setting, this means that a tax policy can be learned that optimizes  any social objective,  and without knowledge of workers\u2019 utility functions or skills.\n  Finding optimal taxes when both workers and the policy maker are learning poses a challenging two-level RL problem:\n In the  inner loop, self-interested workers perform labor, receive income, and pay taxes. They learn through trial-and-error how to adapt their behavior to maximize utility. Given a fixed tax policy, this is a standard multi-agent reinforcement learning problem with a fixed reward function.\n In the  outer loop, tax policies are adapted in order to optimize the social objective. This creates a non-stationary learning environment in which the RL agents need to constantly adapt to a changing utility landscape.\n In other words: because the post-tax income for the same type and amount of labor can change over time, agent decisions that were optimal in the past, might not be optimal in the present.\n This two-level learning problem poses a technical challenge, as the simultaneous behavioral changes of \u00a0agents and changes to the tax policy can lead to unstable learning behavior. We have found that a combination of techniques, including the use of learning curricula and entropy regularization, enable stable convergence. These are described in our technical paper.\n  Our reinforcement learning approach produces dynamic tax policies that yield a substantially better trade-off between equality and productivity than baseline methods.\n   A scaled 2018 US Federal tax schedule. This is a progressive tax: marginal tax rates increase with income.\n An analytical tax formula proposed by Emmanuel Saez. In our setting, this yields a regressive tax schedule: marginal tax rates decrease with income.\n All tax policies make use of seven income brackets, following the framework of the US Federal Income Tax schedule, but varying in their tax rates. The total tax is calculated by summing up the tax for each bracket in which there is income.\n Episodes are divided into ten tax periods of equal length. Throughout each tax period agents interact with the environment to earn income and, at the end of the period, incomes are taxed according to the period&#39;s tax schedule and redistributed evenly to workers. The tax policy of the AI Economist allows the tax schedule to vary across periods.\n We set-up the economic environment such that the fraction of worker incomes per income bracket is in rough alignment with those in the US economy.\n  Our experiments show that the AI Economist achieves at least a 16% gain in the trade-off between equality and productivity  compared to the next best framework, which is provided by the Saez framework. The AI Economist improves equality by 47% compared to the free-market at only an 11% decrease in productivity.\n Social outcomes with AI agents. Productivity (left panel, higher is better) measures the total amount of income generated within an episode (analogous to GDP). Taxation results in a decrease of productivity versus the free market, but the loss in productivity is the smallest under the AI Economist. Income equality (middle panel, higher is better) is highest under the AI Economist. Here, equality is defined as 1 - Gini index and computed on incomes (after taxes and  ...\n   Compared with the baselines, the AI Economist features a more idiosyncratic structure: a blend of progressive and regressive schedules. In particular, it sets a higher top tax rate (income above 510), a lower tax rate for  incomes between 160 and 510, and both higher and lower tax rates on incomes below 160.\n  The collected taxes are redistributed evenly among the agents. In effect, the lower-income agents receive a net subsidy, even though their tax rates are higher (before subsidies). In other words, under the AI Economist, the lowest incomes have a lower tax burden compared to baselines.\n  We observed that under the Saez framework, the  gatherer-and-sellers collect fewer resources than with the AI Economist. This forces the  buyer-and-builders to spend more time to collect resources themselves, which lowers their productivity. At the same time, the Saez framework yields less equality through redistribution as its tax schedule is more regressive. In sum, this yields a worse balance between productivity and equality.\n  Finding optimal taxes can be challenging because AI agents can learn to &#34;game&#34; tax schemes. In our simulation, agents learn that they can lower their average effective tax by alternating between earning high and low incomes, rather than earning a smooth income across periods. This tax gaming occurs for the Saez tax and AI Economist due to their regressive tax rates (higher income brackets have lower tax rates). The performance of the AI Economist demonstrates  ...\n   We also explored whether the AI Economist is effective in experiments with human participants. These experiments used a simpler ruleset to provide better usability, for instance, removing the ability to trade. However, the same economic drivers and trade-offs applied. Participants were paid real money for the utility they gained from building houses. Hence, participants were incentivized to build the number of houses that would maximize their utility. The stakes  ...\n We tested all methods in a zero-shot transfer learning setting, by using the tax rates from the AI-only world in the human setting without retraining. This is an interesting evaluation, because retraining a tax policy might require a large amount of human data. The only modification was to scale down all income brackets by a factor of three to account for lower human productivity compared to AI agents. The full details are in our technical paper.\n   For the experiments with human participants, we selected from the set of trained AI-Driven policies a tax schedule shaped like a  camelback. We compared this schedule with baselines in experiments with participants recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n  In 125 games with 100+ US-based participants, the  camelback schedule achieved an equality-vs-productivity trade-off that is significantly better than the free market and competitive with other baselines. Participants were paid more than $20/hour on average. Compared with AI agents, people were more prone to suboptimal adversarial behaviors, such as blocking other workers. This significantly increased the variance in productivity.\n  Interestingly, the camelback schedule is qualitatively different from the baselines. However, the relative performance of the camelback versus the baselines is consistent across the experiments with only AI and with only people.\n   The camelback tax also statistically significantly outperformed all baselines in regard to an alternative, established social welfare metric that weights the utility of lower income workers more than higher income ones.\n   The strong zero-shot transfer performance on human play is surprising and encouraging. The  camelback tax was competitive with, or outperformed, baselines, without recalibration and while being applied with different rulesets and worker behaviors. As such, these results suggest promise in the use of the AI Economist as a tool for finding good tax policies for real economies.\n AI-based economic simulations still have limitations. They do not yet model human-behavioral factors and interactions between people, including social considerations, and they consider a relatively small economy. However, these kinds of simulations provide a transparent and objective view on the economic consequences of different tax policies. Moreover, this simulation and data-driven approach can be used together with any social objective in order to  ...\n We believe that this kind of research has great potential for increasing equality and productivity in real economies, helping to promote more just and healthy societies. We also hope that the AI Economist can foster transparency, reproducibility, and an open and facts-based discussion about applying machine learning to economic decision-making through our public research publications and open-source code. As such, our hope is that future economic AI  ...\n  Ethics, trust, and transparency are an integral part of Salesforce \u2019s approach to AI research. While the current version of the AI Economist is a limited representation of the real world, and is not a tool that could be currently used with malintent to reconfigure tax policy, we recognize that it could be possible to manipulate future, large-scale iterations of the AI Economist to increase inequality and hide this action behind the results of an AI  ...\n Furthermore, either out of ignorance or malice, bad training data may result in biased recommendations, particularly in cases where users train the tool using their own data. For instance, the under-representation of communities and segments of the work-force in the training data could lead to bias in AI-Driven tax policies. This work also opens up the possibility of using richer, observational data to set individual taxation, an area where we anticipate  ...\n We encourage anyone utilizing the AI Economist to publish a model card or data sheet that describes the ethical considerations of AI-Driven tax schedules in order to increase transparency, and by extension, trust, in the system.\n  To ensure accountability on our part, we shared the paper and an assessment of the ethical risks, mitigation strategies, and assessment of safety to publish with the following external reviewers: Dr. Simon Chesterman, Provost \u2019s Chair and Dean of the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, and Lofred Madzou, AI Project Lead at the World Economic Forum&#39;s Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

"note_en": "Spatial analysis is a type of  GIS analysis that uses math and geometry to understand patterns that happen over space and time, including patterns of human behavior and natural phenomena.\n When performing spatial analysis or  spatial data science, the right tools can open a world of free and collaborative analytics capabilities without costly software licenses.\n We are going to give you a quick tour of some of the open source  P ython libraries available for geospatial analysis. All of these libraries can be easily integrated with  JupyterLab and scale to large datasets.\n    In GIS, the term \u201cvector\u201d describes discrete geometries (points, lines, polygons) with related attribute data (e.g. name, county identifier, population). We can use different geometries to represent the same phenomena depending on our scale and level of measurement. For instance, we can represent the White House as either a point, line, or polygon depending on whether we want to look at a building point-of-interest, building outline, or building footprint.\n   GeoPandas is all about making it easy to work with geospatial data in Python. It expands on the built-in pandas data types within a new data structure called the  GeoDa taFrame. GeoPandas wraps the foundational Python packages Shapely and Fiona, both great packages created by  Sean Gillies.\n  Moving down in the stack from GeoPandas,  Shapely wraps GEOS and defines the actual geometry objects (points, lines, polygons) and the spatial relationships between them (e.g.  adjacency,  within,  contains). You can use shapely directly without GeoPandas, but in a dataframe-centric world, Shapely is less of a direct tool and more a dependency for higher-level packages.\n  Fiona can read and write many kinds of geospatial vector data and easily integrates with other Python GIS libraries. It relies on OGR / GEOS for reading shapefiles, geopackages, geojson, topojson, KML, GML from both the local filesystem and cloud services like Amazon S3 by wrapping Python\u2019s boto3 library.\n   Spatialpandas supports Pandas and Dask extensions for vector-based spatial and geometric operations. It is a good tool for working with vectorized geometric algorithms using Numba or Python. The library was first used for polygon rasterization with  Data shader and since has become its own standalone project.\n   Rasters are regularly gridded datasets like GeoTIFFs, JPGs, and PNGs. Regular grids are useful in representing continuous phenomena that are not cleanly represented by points, lines, and polygons. For instance, in analyzing weekly rainfall for Seattle, we would first start with weather station rainfall measurements (points), and interpolate values to create a raster (continuous-surface) to represent rainfall over the entire city.\n   GDAL is the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library which contains input, output, and analysis functions for over 200 geospatial data formats. It supports APIs for all popular programming languages and includes a CLI (command line interface) for quick raster processing tasks (resampling, type conversion, etc.).\n  Rasterio, another creation from the prolific Sean Gilles, is a wrapper around GDAL for use within the Python scientific data stack and integrates well with  X array and  Nump y. It can read, write, organize and store several raster formats like Cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs (COG). A key goal is to provide high-performance and reduced cognitive load for Python developers by using a familiar syntax.\n    Datashaderis a general-purpose rasterization pipeline. We \u2019ve mentioned the difference between vector and raster. What if you want to convert from a vector type to a raster type? This is where Datashader comes in and allows you to intelligently grid your data. Datashader has tools that make it easy to create graphics pipelines with a little bit of code and is an ideal tool for a principled approach to data science. It can handle large datasets and allows users to generate meaningful  ...\n   Xarray-Spatialimplements common raster analysis functions using Numba and provides a codebase that is easy to install and extend. It originated from the Datashader project and includes tools for surface analysis (e.g. slope, curvature, hillshade, viewshed), proximity analysis (e.g. euclidean distance, great circle distance), and zonal / focal analysis (summary statistics by region or neighborhood). It is not dependent on GDAL or GEOS and was created to support core raster analysis  ...\n     RTree wraps the C library  libspatialindex for building and querying large indexes of rectangles.\u00a0 Most times rectangles represent the bounding boxes of polygons which makes the RTree library essential for fast point-in-polygon operations.\u00a0 One downside of this library is that the underlying C/C++ code is not thread-safe.\u00a0 This can cause problems when trying to access the same index from different threads or processes, but still a very useful tool which Geopandas also wraps.\n  PyProj is useful for map projections, which define how we distort a 3D world converting to a 2D map. PyProj wraps the Proj4 library and performs cartographic transformations between coordinate reference systems like WGS84 (longitude / latitude) and UTM (meters west / meters north).\u00a0 Map projections can be difficult to understand and PyProj does a great job.\n  There are many tools at our disposal to do geospatial data analysis and visualizations. Although we just highlighted some tools in the Python stack, geospatial analysis is not limited to Python.\n Python\u2019s motto is \u201cProgramming for Everybody\u201d and this certainly holds true for the geo community. Python is the first language for many aspiring data scientists and we hope this list will help you on your geo-journey.\n  Do you have any questions, suggestions, or Python/non-Python stacks you love doing your spatial analysis with?\n  Do you have questions about how to implement these free tools?

At $10.22 billion, Amazon Web Services revenue grew 33% on an annualized basis,\u00a0the company said in a statement on Thursday.\n Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected $10.33 billion in first-quarter revenue, although comparing results with estimates is not straightforward given that the coronavirus spread across the globe in the quarter.\n  Alibaba, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle all continue to trail AWS even as its growth has slowed.  Microsoft, which is considered the No. 2 cloud infrastructure provider, doesn&#39;t disclose revenue, although it said on Wednesday that revenue from the Azure cloud  grew 59% in the quarter.\n AWS delivered 13.5% of Amazon&#39;s total revenue. Launched in 2006, AWS is now bigger than all of Oracle, which was founded almost 30 years earlier. Oracle  reported quarterly revenue last month of $9.8 billion.\n Operating income from AWS totaled $3.08 billion, which was up 38% and above the $2.96 billion FactSet consensus estimate. That works out to 77% of Amazon&#39;s overall operating income.\n  Goldman Sachs analysts led by Heath Terry, who have a buy rating on Amazon stock, raised their estimates for first- and second-quarter AWS revenue in a note distributed to clients last week.\n  &#34;Our partner checks continue to reflect the relative strength in the AWS platform, as incremental demand from customers to accelerate their migration into the cloud, provide full virtual-desktop coverage (AWS WorkSpaces), and other work-from-home and business continuity needs, seem to have more than offset the disruption from longer sales cycles and delays in planned\u00a0migrations as IT priorities have shifted in the current environment,&#34; the analysts wrote.\n  AWS came close to the $10 billion mark in the fourth quarter, when it delivered  $9.95 billion in revenue.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:49:32", "tags": "\u5b63\u5ea6,revenue,aws", "title": "AWS\u5b63\u5ea6\u6536\u5165\u9996\u6b21\u7a81\u7834100\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143", "title_en": "AWS tops $10B in quarterly revenue for the first time", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/30/aws-earnings-q1-2020.html", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u5b63\u5ea6", "revenue", "aws"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000085, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u57fa\u4e8eAWS Lambda\u3001AWS HTTP API\u3001Express.js\u3001Reaction\u548cDynamoDB\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3001\u5168\u5806\u6808\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n\u8bf7\u786e\u4fdd\u60a8\u5df2\u767b\u5f55\u3002CD\u653e\u5165\u4efb\u4f55\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6587\u4ef6\u5939(\u4f8b\u5982API\u3001Site\u7b49)\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8fd0\u884cSLS\u767b\u5f55\u3002\n\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u90e8\u7f72\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5efa\u8bae\u53ea\u90e8\u7f72\u60a8\u8981\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5168\u90e8\u4e00\u8d77\u90e8\u7f72(\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u5192\u9669\u5728\u66f4\u6539\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90e8\u7f72\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5462\uff1f)\u3002\u8981\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u8bf7\u7528cd\u8fdb\u5165\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fd0\u884c\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\n\u5728\u4f7f\u7528./api\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f3a\u70c8\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u8be5\u547d\u4ee4\u76d1\u89c6\u60a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u90e8\u7f72\u5b83\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06console.log()\u8bed\u53e5\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u5b9e\u65f6\u5730\u76f4\u63a5\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u60a8\u7684CLI\uff01\n\u5982\u679c\u8981\u5c06\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u767b\u5f55\u9875\u9762\u548cAPI\uff0c\u8bf7\u5728serverless.yml\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u786c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5728serverless.yml\u4e2d\u5f15\u7528\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5982\u4e0b\u6240\u793a\uff1a\n\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528.env\u6587\u4ef6(\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u540e\u53f0\u6587\u4ef6\u540d\u79f0)\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u540e\u53f0\u6587\u4ef6\u6dfb\u52a0\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\uff1a", "note_en": "A complete, serverless, full-stack application built on AWS Lambda, AWS HTTP API, Express.js, React and DynamoDB.\n      Make sure you are logged in.  cd into any component folders (e.g.  api,  site, etc.) and run  sls login.\n  After initial deployment, we recommend deploying only the parts you are changing, not the entire thing together (why risk deploying your database with a code change?).

"note_en": "How to structure large React apps into folders and files is a highly opinionated topic. I struggled for a while writing about this subject, because there is no right way to do it. However, every other week people ask me about how I structure my React projects. Not only about folder structures for small React projects, but more importantly about scalable React applications. After implementing React applications for a few years now, I want to give you a breakdown on how I approach this matter for my  ...\n For anyone who says &#34;I move files around until it feels right&#34;: This may be alright as a solo developer or in a small team. But is that really something you would do in a cross-functional team of 4 developers with a total of 5 cross-functional teams in your company? At a higher scale of teams it becomes tricky to &#34;just move files around without a clear vision&#34;. In addition, this is nothing I could tell my clients when they ask me about this matter. Hence this walkthrough as reference  ...\n  The first step follows the rule: One file to rule them all. Most React projects start with a  src/ folder and one  src/App.js file with an App component. At least that&#39;s what you get when you are using  create-react-app. This App  function component just renders something:\n  Eventually this component adds more features, it naturally grows in size, and needs to extract parts of it as standalone React components. Here we are extracting a  React list component with another child component from the App component:\n  Whenever you start with a new React project, I tell people it&#39;s fine to have multiple components in one file. It&#39;s even fine in a larger React application, whenever one component is strictly tight to another one. However, in this scenario, eventually your one file will not be sufficient anymore for your React project. That&#39;s when we transition to step two.\n  The second step follows the rule: Multiple files to rule them all. Take for instance our previous App component with its List and ListItem components: Rather than having everything in one  src/App.js file, we can split these components up into multiple files. You decide how far you want to take it here. For example, I would go with the following folder structure:\n  While the  src/List.js file would have the implementation details of the List and ListItem components, it would only  export the List component from the file as public API to this file:\n    If you would take this one step further, you could also extract the ListItem component into its own file and let the List component import the ListItem component:\n  However, as said before, this may take it too far, because so far the ListItem component is tightly coupled to the List component. Hence it would be okay to leave it in the  src/List.js file. I follow the rule of thumb that whenever a React component becomes a  reusable React component, I split it out as a standalone file, like we did with the List component, to make it accessible for other React components.\n  From here it becomes more interesting and more opinionated. Every React component grows in complexity eventually. Not only because more logic is added (e.g. more JSX with  conditional rendering or  React Hooks), but also because there are more technical concerns like styling and tests. A naive approach would be to add more files next to each React component. For example, let&#39;s say every React component has a test and a style file:\n  One can already see that this doesn&#39;t scale well, because with every additional component in the  src/ folder we will lose more sight of every individual component. That&#39;s why I like to have one folder for each React component:\n  The naming of these files is up to you. For example,  index.js may become  component.js or  test.js may become  spec.js. Moreover, if you are not using CSS but something like  Styled Components, your file extension may change from  style.css to  style.js too. Once you get used to your naming convention, you can just search for &#34;List index&#34; or &#34;App test&#34; in your IDE for opening each file. If you collapse all component folders, you have a very concise and clear folder structure:\n  If there are more technical concerns for a component, for example you may want to extract custom hooks into their own file for certain components, you can scale this approach horizontally within the component folder:\n  If you decide to keep your  List/index.js more lightweight by extracting the ListItem component in its own file, then you may want to try the following folder structure:\n  Here again you can go one step further by giving the component its own folder with all other technical concerns like tests and styles:\n  Important: From here on you need to be careful to not nest too deeply your components into each other. My rule of thumb is that I am never nesting components more than two levels, so the List and ListItem folders would be alright, but the ListItem&#39;s folder shouldn&#39;t have another nested folder.\n After all, if you are not going beyond midsize React projects, this is in my opinion the way to go to structure your React components. However, as I mentioned, this is highly opinionated and may not meet everyones taste.\n  The next step will help you to structure midsize to large React applications. It separates features from components which are used by more than one component. Take the following folder structure as example:\n  We group our previous React components into a new  components/ folder. This gives us another vertical layer for creating folders for other categories. For example, at some point you may have React Hooks that can be used by more than one component. So instead of coupling the hook tightly to a component, you can put the implementation of it in a dedicated folder which can be used by all React components:\n  This doesn&#39;t mean that all hooks should end up in this folder though. React Hooks which are still only used by one component should remain in the component&#39;s file or maybe in a separate  hooks.js file in the component&#39;s folder. Only hooks that can be consumed by all React components end up in the  hooks/ folder.\n The same strategy may apply if you are using  React Context in your project which needs to be accessed globally by all your other files:\n  From here, there may be other utilities which need to be accessible to your components and hooks. For miscellaneous utilities I usually create a  services/ folder. The name is up to you, but again it&#39;s the principal of making logic available to other code in our project which drives this technical separation:\n    Fortunately  JavaScript&#39;s Intl API gives us excellent tools for date conversions. However, instead of using the API directly in my React components, I like to have a service for it, because only this way I can guarantee that my components have only a slim set of actively used date formatting options available for my application. Otherwise there would be lots of different date formats in a growing application.\n   But also as a service, as an encapsulated module in other words, what I usually like to do:\n  It may become difficult to import things with relative paths now. Therefore I always would opt-in  Babel&#39;s Module Resolver for aliases. Afterward, your import may look like the following:\n  After all, I like this technical separation of concerns, because it gives every folder a dedicated purpose and it encourages sharing functionality across the application.\n  The last step will help you to structure large React applications. This happens when you find yourself with lots of subfolders in your technical separated folders. The example doesn&#39;t show the full extent, but I hope you get the point:\n  From here I would use the  components/ folder only for reusable components (e.g. UI components). Every other component should move to a domain centred folder. The names of the folders are again up to you:\n  If a PaymentForm needs access to a Button or Input, it imports it from the reusable UI components folder. If a MessageList component needs an abstract List component, it imports it as well. Furthermore, if a service from the previous step is tightly coupled to a domain, then move the service to the specific domain folder. The same may apply to other folders which were previously separated by technical concern:\n  Whether there should be an intermediate  services/ folder in each domain folder is up to you. You could also leave out the folder and put the  ErrorTracking/ folder directly into  Error/. However, this may be confusing, because ErrorTracking should be marked somehow as a service and not as a React component. As alternative you could also use a  kebab-case naming convention, which is better than PascalCase anyway, by going with  error-tracking/ instead of  ErrorTracking/.\n There is lots of room for your personal touch here. After all, this step is just about bringing the domains together which allows teams in your company to work on specific domains without having to touch files across the project.\n  Having all this written, I hope it helps one or the other person or team structuring their React project.

The situation remains fluid, according to the Journal&#39;s sources.\n Shares of Hertz declined more than 15% in trading Wednesday, as broader indices rose, following The Wall Street Journal&#39;s report.\n The news of a possible bankruptcy arrives two days after Hertz on Monday said in a  regulatory filing\u00a0that it &#34;did not make certain payments&#34; on its operating lease as it remains in discussions with lenders to reduce its payments. If those discussions aren&#39;t fruitful by the first week of May, &#34;Hertz could be materially and negatively impacted,&#34; it said.\n    Earlier in April,  the company laid off 10,000 workers \u2014 about 26% of its workforce at the end of 2019 \u2014 &#34;in an effort to align staffing levels with travel demand.&#34;\n A Hertz representative said they were &#34;unable to comment&#34; on the Wall Street Journal report, but offered the following statement regarding the filings:\n &#34;As a result of the pandemic and the uncertainty about the timing and strength of a recovery, Hertz is taking aggressive actions to preserve liquidity to support its ongoing operations,&#34; they said. &#34;We are reducing expenses, deferring capital expenditures, and adjusting fleet\u00a0levels and staffing based on the significant decline in travel demand. Our\u00a0 8-ktoday provided an update on our vehicle financing. Importantly, conversations with our lenders are ongoing and we remain in discussions  ...\n Ryan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, theorized on April 23 that government assistance could help Hertz remain solvent.\n   &#34;We do think a potentially large amount of cash could be made available to Hertz from the federal government, potentially solving any liquidity concerns, although we are also uncertain with regard to the terms,&#34; he said in a note to clients.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:49:17", "tags": "\u79df\u8f66,rental,\u8d6b\u5179,hertz", "title":

"note_en": "The Mustang community is mourning the great loss of an automotive icon that lost his short battle with liver cancer.\n Gale Halderman is a legendary name in the Ford Mustang world. Not only did Gale take pride working at Ford Motor Company for 40 years, but he was also a member of the Mustang Hall of Fame. Last but most certainly not least, Gale was the main designer of the original Ford Mustang. Sadly, the car community is mourning a great loss as Gale Halderman just passed away at the age of 87 after a short battle with liver cancer.\n  The night before Gale had a big meeting about Lee Iacocca&#39;s new concept car called the  Ford Mustang, he stayed up late at his kitchen table and sketched out his idea. He knew that it needed to have a few attributes. The new  Mustangneeded to be sporty, exciting, and appeal to both genders. A long hood with a short deck would be ideal. The heat was on as many other Ford designers were also sketching out their very own ideas for the cat. Gale and his boss Jim Oros collaborated and worked on their  ...\n We have to give credit where credit is due. Who knows where Ford&#39;s iconic pony car would stand today if Gale&#39;s sketch wasn&#39;t chosen and ultimately turned into the 1965 (or 1964 1/2)  Ford Mustang, an iconic classic that is as much of an American staple as apple pie. If you want to go even deeper, the modern Mustang would \u00a0probably look nothing like it does today if it weren&#39;t for the original car designed by Gale, and even more, it is quite possible that the  Mustangname may not  ...\n Gale&#39;s legacy goes even further than that. He was employed with Ford Motor Company for a long four decades as a designer or designer executive. The word legend isn&#39;t lightly tossed around as he had worked alongside the top names at Ford such as Henry Ford II, Hal Sperlich, and of course, Lee Iacocca. Bill Ford Jr. once answered to Gale as his boss at one point in time during his time at the Blue Oval.\n   Once Gale eventually retired from the Blue Oval, he dedicated his time to turn their family barn into a museum all about the car&#39;s design. Since Gale was a humble man, this wasn&#39;t a way to showcase his own work, but a place where he could mostly showcase the work of others. We could all certainly agree that we wouldn&#39;t mind to see a museum dedicated to Gale and his many accomplishments. The walls are adorned with sketches, concepts, and designs collected over time from talented artists  ...\n Gale was a legend and left a legacy. He is survived by three daughters, nine grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. Not only that, he is survived by the countless individuals considered his Mustang family over the past 55 years. Rest in peace, Gale Halderman.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:49:08", "tags": "\u798f\u7279,\u8bbe\u8ba1,\u91ce\u9a6c,ford,gale", "title":

"Health Officers caution that reducing restrictions too quickly could lead to a substantial resurgence of COVID-19\n          Santa Clara County, CA \u2013\u00a0The seven Bay Area Public Health Officers who ordered a shelter in place in mid-March will  extend the orders through May 31while some restrictions are eased and tools to strengthen containment of COVID-19 are put into place. The social distancing intervention has slowed the increase of new cases and prevented the anticipated medical surge. As restrictions are eased, it is critical to ensure that growth of cases can be sufficiently contained to protect the  ...\n  All construction activities, certain businesses that operate primarily outdoors, and some outdoor activities will be allowed to resume with specific conditions.\n  These new Health Officer orders, which take effect May 4, cover everyone living or working in the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara as well as the City of Berkeley, an independent public health jurisdiction. As of April 28, 2020, there are 7,273 confirmed cases (up from 258 confirmed cases on March 15, 2020) and 266 deaths (up from 4 deaths on March 15, 2020) in the seven Bay Area jurisdictions jointly issuing this Order.\n  This next phase reflects regional progress, thanks to the collective action Bay Area residents have taken since mid-March in response to Health Officer shelter-in-place orders. Those actions have saved lives and staved off mass hospitalizations from the COVID-19 virus, which spreads easily and causes severe illness in many people.\u00a0 There is not yet an effective treatment or cure for the disease.\n  This initial, measured easing of some restrictions is designed to set the stage for a gradual resumption of activity and prevent rapid, exponential growth of cases that could overwhelm hospitals for a particular jurisdiction or the region as a whole.\n  &#34;This impact of the virus has been hard for many of us, but we are now on a path for steady progress, which now allows some low-risk activities to return,&#34; said Dr. Lisa B. Hernandez, Health Officer for the City of Berkeley. &#34;This virus is still in our communities. We need everyone to shelter-in-place apart from the few exceptions \u2013 and wear a face covering when out.&#34;\n  &#34;The new order allows us to carefully monitor our progress while building the essential public health infrastructure \u2013 such as contact tracing and testing capacity \u2013 that will support our gradual reopening and make recovery possible,&#34; said Dr. Tom\u00e1s Aragon, Health Officer for the City and County of San Francisco.\n  Under the new orders, all construction projects will be allowed to resume as long as the project complies with safety protocols included with the order.\u00a0 All real estate transactions will also now be able to resume, but with continued restrictions on open houses and limitations on in-person viewings.\u00a0 Any employee allowed to return to work at a facility can also access childcare programs that can operate.\n  Certain outdoor businesses can also begin operating again, and people can visit those businesses to perform work or obtain goods, services, or supplies.\u00a0 This includes wholesale and retail nurseries, landscapers, gardeners, and other businesses that primarily provide outdoor services as set forth in the order.\u00a0 Outdoor businesses do not include restaurants, cafes or bars, regardless of whether they have outdoor seating.\n  Other activities that can resume under the new order include residential moves and the use of certain shared outdoor recreational facilities that were previously ordered closed, like skate parks, but not others that involve shared equipment or physical contact.\n  These orders are generally consistent with the state&#39;s shelter in place order.\u00a0 On any issue where the local and state orders may differ, the stricter order applies.\n  These orders are generally consistent with the state&#39;s shelter in place order.\u00a0 On any issue where the local and state orders may differ, the stricter order applies.\n              Health Officers are also releasing  indicators\u200b that will be used to measure progress in containing the virus and ensuring we have the infrastructure in place to protect the community from COVID-19.\u00a0 These indicators will be critical to decisions in the coming weeks and months about when and how to ease shelter-in-place restrictions.\n    Whether there is an adequate supply of personal protective equipment for all health care workers;\n  Whether we are meeting the need for testing, especially for persons in vulnerable populations or those in high-risk settings or occupations; and\n  Whether we have the capacity to investigate all COVID-19 cases and trace all of their contacts, isolating those who test positive and quarantining the people who may have been exposed.\n  &#34;A pandemic of this scale is unprecedented,&#34; said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County Health Officer. &#34;We are progressing steadily as a region, but we must reduce restrictions on activity gradually or we will put the lives of many community members at risk.&#34;\n                                      \r\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:49:00", "tags":

money but the state won&#39;t get a say: this is a concise summary of what Lufthansa&#39;s Executive Board, headed by CEO Carsten Spohr, has been telling German politicians in the past few weeks.\n According to an investigation by Business Insider, Lufthansa is now so up to its neck in water, the airline&#39;s management had to come to an agreement with the German state on the afternoon of Monday, April 27, after hours of negotiations.\n The agreement entails the state using $10 billion to bail out Germany&#39;s last remaining international airline.\n    It&#39;s expected that one or two supervisory board mandates will be given to the German federal government.\n  However, as a result of the worldwide travel restrictions in the Corona crisis, Lufthansa is currently making losses of around $1 million every hour.\n  Founded in 1953, Lufthansa began flight operations two years later and was, until 1963, entirely in state hands.\n   The federal government, however, sold its shares in the mid-1990s, so Lufthansa has been fully privatized since 1997.\n  According to the investigation, the state is pumping just under $10 billion into the badly hit company.\n In return, the government, as the new shareholder, will receive a blocking minority and one or two supervisory board seats, but these will not be filled by civil servants or politicians.\n Formally, the company will then be associated with the Federal Ministry of Finance as a state holding.\n     The most crucial factor in the agreement was that the appointment of civil servants or politicians to the supervisory board was unacceptable in the eyes of Lufthansa&#39;s executives.\n  Spohr himself didn&#39;t officially take part in yesterday&#39;s talks but on Tuesday, he wants to formally seal the deal with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany&#39;s finance minister, Olaf Scholz.\n Through the investigation, Business Insider learned that it&#39;s unlikely the matter will be negotiated again.\n   Spohr had recently proposed an Airbus model for Lufthansa. Germany, France, and Spain hold a quarter of the shares of the aircraft manufacturer but don&#39;t exercise any direct influence over the company.\n  Read the original article on  Business Insider Deutschland.

the California state COVID-19 emergency response website in collaboration with the CHHS Office of Innovation and the California Department of Technology.\n  Our challenge: Create a scalable, accessible, stable website that is easy to update in a fast changing public health crisis. And do it in four days.\n  This challenge is one that will be familiar to our digital colleagues working in other states, cities and countries right now. We\u2019ve been super impressed by and appreciative of the work being done in places like  San Francisco,  New Jersey and the  United Kingdom.\n  Just like those teams, we\u2019ve been focused on prioritizing user needs in this time of crisis. And we thought it could be useful to share out how we\u2019ve been using technology/development decisions to do this.\n  For our team, we started by returning to one of our core principles: \u201cAlways accessible.\u201d\n  We recognize, of course, that \u201cAlways accessible\u201d is not a novel approach. Here in California accessibility is a guiding principle in the state\u2019s digital strategy. And our work is just one part of the state\u2019s larger commitment to ensuring that information and services are accessible.\n  What is novel is how our team is broadening the definition of accessibility for state government to include performance as a core component. Performance as accessibility.\n  Our goal is to make COVID19.CA.gov fast and easy to use on any kind of hardware or with any level of bandwidth.\n  We\u2019re not yet 100% accessible \u2013 but accessibility is 100% our north star and what we are working toward every day.\n      We run automated audits which give us performance and accessibility scores on every build. Getting a high score on these automated tools is a good initial indicator, but not the whole story. We also manually test sites, ensuring we remain accessible via alternative navigation modes. We test with screen readers, which gives us a sense of how our site is experienced by site-impaired users. This helps find and eliminate interactions that might trap or slow people down.\n  We\u2019re grateful for support from the  California Department of Rehabilitation. The DOR team trained us to use those screen readers and has been instrumental helping us understand and avoid many common issues often created accidentally.\n  And we\u2019re grateful to the CHHS Office of Innovation whose team members are the frontline in our work to make our content accessible and clear.\n    Fast sites are more successful than slow ones. And some tools make it easier than others to produce fast sites.\n  Our team uses Bootstrap, which by default, is quite large. So we make sure to run CSS pruning processes to trim out all unused code before deploying to production. We also avoid the Bootstrap javascript widgets because we prefer using small, low dependency Web Components.\n    Delivering the desired layout and interactivity with a small code footprint allows us to hit our performance goals more easily. We create light frontend interactivity by publishing Web Components. When we have to build our own we use some of the  open-wc build tools that help by providing models for running components in isolation and integrated testing patterns.\n  We are mostly depending on the custom element part of the web component standard. This lets us easily use components on different properties with an npm install and using the tag on a page, allowing us to provide the maximum amount of flexibility and reuse. Building new frontend properties using Web Components is a user-first choice for many reasons:\n  Web Components can be modified in isolation and versioned so consumers can choose which versions to install\n  These advantages give new code a better chance for longevity and higher probability that our current efforts are providing future benefit instead of technical debt.\n  We are aware that building our own  components when necessary is a big decision. We only undertake this when we can\u2019t find existing options that use dependencies sparingly and provide the required UI. When creating new components we run tests\u00a0 in browsers, down to IE11, as well as ensuring they adhere to all of our other standards for accessibility and performance.\n    We\u2019re proud to have achieved a high score on our  Lighthouse performance audit but that isn\u2019t enough for government tools, especially in this time of crisis.\n  We need to go above and beyond to ensure that all users are able to get a performant experience, no matter their device. This is especially true since users aren\u2019t able to shop around for a different, better government experience.\n  So we picked up the cheapest phone they had at Cricket Wireless. A $20 device running Android 9, with no contract commitment has been one of the most useful and effective tools in our effort to be accessible.\n  The experience on this device is pretty different from what we see on the newest iPhones or Google Pixel devices. Pages delivering a lot of javascript are slow to render and respond to interaction, any scroll triggered effects look terrible and not actually cool (like they look on a new iPhone). Even swiping quickly through long, complex pages can be frustrating and slow as the device struggles to render lots of content.\n  Leaner, faster sites benefit  everybody, but making sure your applications run smoothly on low-end hardware makes a massive difference for those users.\n    As we add new features, it can be difficult to keep tabs on how our performance is changing. As well as using Lighthouse, we\u2019ve introduced Calibre to our reporting, as this enabled us to keep our builds fast. We\u2019re able to trigger performance and accessibility reports on each build with a process running outside of the build itself.\n      We can use this same data to report to our dashboards. This helps us with visibility to the whole team, not just the engineers.\n      Alex Russell, Senior Staff Software Engineer for Chrome at Google, kindly  analyzed the covid19.ca.gov site. He identified some areas for improvement with our fonts and integration with Google Analytics.\n  We were stoked to have\u00a0 Alex\u2019s deep expertise benefit COVID19.CA.gov. And we\u2019re deeply appreciative of his advocacy to pay attention to performance.\n  Overall, Alex found that the covid19.ca.gov site was fast, rendered quickly and finished all operations faster than similar sites, which helps users get the information they need quickly and easily.\n        API endpoints running on FAAS allow us to keep our backend code in isolated, cheap, scalable components. The  @CAdotGov team is running infrastructure mostly on Azure.  Carter Medlin set up the first APIs on Azure\u2019s FAAS services.\n      Covid19.ca.gov received millions of visitors in the hours after Governor Newsom announced the statewide Stay at Home Order.\n  The site was able to handle this level of traffic easily because we removed every unnecessary piece from the production service pipeline. This provided us with peace of mind ahead of launch, lowers costs and improves stability. While our content is constantly updated and deployed automatically, we create a pregenerated version of the final build each time so that production systems serve the body of pages as static  ...\n  We chose  11ty as our static content generator because we like their philosophy and emphasis on performance and accessibility. Making the production build a set of static files removes a lot of common bottlenecks. Scaling concerns are radically simplified because the initial content is delivered without database connections or even any server side code execution.\n  Removing complexity and risk from the production pipeline doesn\u2019t require us to forego any interactivity or force us to abandon mature open source tools.\n  We are making the choice to run all computation possible before deployment. We are still using APIs for data driven interactions, such as the  Telehealth provider lookups page. Content is authored in our private WordPress repository and the output is integrated with 11ty, so we don\u2019t run PHP on public servers.\n    We chose WordPress for their premier authoring environment but decided not to use it as a content delivery tool. This allowed us to take advantage of the mature writing tools WordPress provides without needing to support any of its dependencies in our production environment.\n  We were able to decouple WordPress authoring from reading by using its built in API. We set its publish trigger to notify our Function as a Service (FAAS) service when content was updated. Our  FAAS tool moved the post content from WordPress to Github.\n  We then used  a Github Action to trigger 11ty builds and deploy to a browseable github pages branch which then triggers the deploy to our Azure production environment\n      We know that the COVID-19 pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint. We\u2019re mindful there\u2019s more work to do in the coming weeks and months. And our team is looking forward to continuing to meet the challenge of this moment by ensuring that the people of California get the information they need quickly and easily.", "posttime": "2020-05-02

"note_en": "Last week, we started at 1 and slowly and steadily worked our way up to 1,000,000. We used dots. It was cute.\n  Before things get totally out of hand, let\u2019s start by working our way up the still-fathomable powers of 10\u2014\n  When we went from 1 to 1,000,000, we didn\u2019t need powers\u2014we could just use a short string of digits to represent the numbers we were talking about. If we wanted to multiply a number by 10, we just added a zero.\n But as you advance past a million, zeros start to become plentiful and you need a different notation. That\u2019s why we use powers. When people talk about exponential growth, they\u2019re referring to the craziness that can happen when you start using powers. For example:\n  As we get bigger and bigger today, we\u2019ll stick with powers of 10, because when you start talking about really big numbers, what becomes relevant is the number of digits, not the digits themselves\u2014i.e. every 70-digit number is somewhere between 10 69 and 10 70, which is really all you need to know. So for at least the first part of this post, the powers of 10 can serve nicely as orders-of-magnitude \u201ccheckpoints\u201d.\n Each time we up the power by one, we multiply the world we\u2019re in by ten, changing things significantly. Let\u2019s start off where we left off last time\u2014\n 10 6 (1 million \u2013 1,000,000) \u2013 The amount of dots in that  huge image we finished up with last week. On my computer screen, that image was about 18cm x 450cm = .81 m 2 in area.\n 10 7 (10 million) \u2013 This brings us to a range that includes the number of steps it would take to walk around the Earth (40 million steps). If each of your steps around the Earth were represented by a dot like those from the grids in the last post, the dots would fill a 6m x 6m square.\n 10 8 (100 million) \u2013 Now we\u2019re at the number of books  ever published in human history (130 million), and at the top of this range, the  estimatednumber of words a human being speaks in a lifetime (860 million). Also in this range are the odds of winning the really big lotteries. A recent Mega Millions lottery had 1-in-175,711,536 odds of winning. To put those chances in perspective, that \u2019s about the number of seconds in six years. So it \u2019s like knowing a hedgehog will sneeze once and  ...\n 10 9 (1 billion 1  \u2013 1,000,000,000) \u2013 Here we have the number of seconds in a century (about 3 billion), the number of living humans (7.125 billion), and to fit a billion dots, our dot image would cover two basketball courts.\n 10 10 (10 billion) \u2013 Now we\u2019re up to the years since the Big Bang (13.7 billion) and the number of seconds since Jesus Christ lived (60 billion).\n 10 11 (100 billion) \u2013 This is about the number of stars in the Milky Way and the number of galaxies in the observable universe (100-400 billion)\u2014so if a computer listed one observable galaxy every second since Christ, it wouldn\u2019t be anywhere close to finished currently.\n 10 12 (1 trillion \u2013 1,000,000,000,000) \u2013 A million millions. The amount of pounds the scale would show if you put the whole human race on it (~1 trillion), the number of seconds humans have been around (~100,000 years = ~3 trillion seconds), and larger than both of those totals combined, the number of miles in one light year (6 trillion). A trillion is so big that you\u2019d only need 4 trillion millimeters of ribbon to tie a bow around the sun.\n 10 13 (10 trillion) \u2013 This is about as big as we can get for numbers we hear discussed in the real world, and it\u2019s almost always related to nations and dollars\u2014the US nominal GDP in 2013 was just under $17 trillion, and its debt is currently just under $18 trillion. Both of those are dwarfed by the number of cells in the human body (37 trillion).\n 10 14 (100 trillion) \u2013 100 trillion is about the number of letters in every published book in human history, as well as the number of bacteria in your body. 2 Also in this range is the total wealth of the world ($241 trillion, which we discussed  at great length in a previous post).\n 10 15 (1 quadrillion) \u2013 Okay goodbye normal words. People say the words million, billion, and trillion a lot. No one says quadrillion. It\u2019s really uncool to say the word quadrillion. 3 Most people opt for \u201ca million billion\u201d instead. Either way, there are about a quadrillion  ants on Earth. Comparing this to the bacteria fact, it\u2019s like you have 1/10th of the world\u2019s ants crawling around inside your body.\n 10 16 (10 quadrillion) \u2013 It\u2019s in this range that we get to the number of playing cards you\u2019d have to accidentally knock off the table to cover the entire Earth (89 quadrillion). People would be mad at you.\n 10 17 (100 quadrillion) \u2013 The number of seconds since the Big Bang.  Also the number of references to Kim Kardashian that entered my soundscape in the last week. Please stop.\n 10 18 (1 quintillion) \u2013 Also known as a billion billion, the word quintillion manages to be even less cool than a quadrillion. No one who has social skills ever says the word quintillion. Anyway, it\u2019s the number of cubic meters of water in all the Earth\u2019s oceans and the number of atoms in a grain of salt (1.2 quintillion). The number of grains of sand on every beach on Earth is about 7.5 quintillion\u2014the same number of atoms in  six grains of salt.\n 10 19 (10 quintillion) \u2013 The number of millimeters from here to the closest next star (38 quintillion millimeters).\n 10 20 (100 quintillion) \u2013 The number of meter-long steps it would take you to walk across the whole Milky Way. So many podcasts. And heard of a Planck volume? It\u2019s the smallest volume scientists talk about, so small you could fit 100 quintillion of them in a  proton. More on Planck volumes later. Oh, and our dot image? By the time we get to 600 quintillion dots, the image would cover the surface of the Earth.\n 10 21 (1 sextillion) \u2013 Now we\u2019re even beyond the vocabulary of the weirdos. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard someone say \u201csextillion\u201d out loud, and I hope to keep it that way.\n 10 23 (100 sextillion) \u2013 A rough estimate  for the number of stars in the observable universe. You also had to deal with this number in high school\u2014602 sextillion, or 6.02 x 10 23\u2014is a mole, or Avogadro\u2019s Number, and the number of hydrogen atoms in a gram of hydrogen.\n  10 25 (10 septillion) \u2013 The number of drops of water in all the world\u2019s oceans.\n 10 27 (1 octillion) \u2013 If the Earth were hollow, it would take 1 octillion peas to pack it full. And I think we\u2019ve heard just about enough from octillion.\n Okay so now let\u2019s take a huge leap forward into a whole different territory\u2014somewhere where the Earth\u2019s volume is too tiny and the Big Bang too recent to use in examples. In this new arena of number, only the observable universe\u2014a sphere about 92 billion light years across\u2014can handle the magnitude we\u2019re dealing with. 4 10 80 \u2013 To get to 10 80, you take trillion and you multiply it by a trillion, by a trillion, by a trillion, by a trillion, by a trillion, by a hundred million.  ...\n 10 86 \u2013 And what if you wanted to pack the entire observable universe sphere with peas? You\u2019d need 10 86 peas to make it happen.\n 10 90 \u2013 This is how many medium size grains of sand (.5mm in diameter) it would take to pack the universe full.\n  The name googol came about when American mathematician Edward Kasner got cute one day in 1938 and asked his 9-year-old nephew Milton to come up with a  ...\n I\u2019m using the American short scale system\u2014in the British long scale system, you don\u2019t get to a billion until 10 12. \u21a9\n   I\u2019m going to use the term \u201cuniverse\u201d to refer to the observable universe so I don\u2019t have to type observable 49 times in this post. \u21a9\n 59 years later, Sergey Brin and Larry Page named their new search engine after this number because they wanted to emphasize the large quantities of information the engine could provide. They spelled it wrong by accident. \u21a9\n   Or a g 65 number of years, which would be (3 [Graham\u2019s number of arrows] 3)\u2026or a g g 64 number of years\u2026I could go on. \u21a9", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:48:47", "tags": "\u53f7\u7801,number,\u6570\u91cf", "title": "\u4ece1M\u5230\u683c\u96f7\u5384\u59c6\u7684\u53f7\u7801--\u7b49\u7b49\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5462\uff1f", "title_en": "From 1M to Graham's Number \u2013 Wait but Why", "transed": 0, "url": "https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/11/1000000-grahams-number.html", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u53f7\u7801", "number", "\u6570\u91cf"]}]
