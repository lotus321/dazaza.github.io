"note_en": "A U.S. district judge in the District of Columbia\u00a0 signed off on a historic settlement Thursday, putting an end to 8-year-old litigation between the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Facebook.\n The FTC  sued Facebook back in 2012 over eight privacy violations, saying that Facebook made deceptive claims about users\u2019 ability to control their personal data. The FTC alleged that Facebook misled its users into using default settings that weren\u2019t nearly as private as users believed they were. Also in 2012, Facebook was ordered to make remedial changes; then, it allegedly violated that order \u2013 which resulted in yet more litigation with the FTC.\n To settle the current litigation, Facebook agreed that it would not make misrepresentations about data security and would implement a new privacy program. The settlement also obligates Facebook to pay $5 billion in civil penalties; that penalty is significantly larger than the next-closest penalty the FTC has ever won\u2013which topped out at $22.5 million.\n The new finalized settlement between Facebook and the FTC is the product of lengthy netotiations between the parties \u2013 but still required court approval to take effect. As with all similar settlements, the court must declare the settlement fair, reasonable, and in the public interest \u2013 a relatively low bar.\u00a0But Judge  Timothy Kellywasn \u2019t as passive and detached as many judges are when approving a settlement. Kelly served up some harsh words for Facebook, warning the social media giant not  ...\n \u201dIn the Court\u2019s view, the unscrupulous way in which the United States alleges Facebook violated both the law and the administrative order is stunning,\u201d Kelly wrote. The judge\u2019s recitations of those allegations at length were not kind to Facebook:\n The allegations in the Complaint reflect many ways in which Facebook purportedly acted improperly. Some of these allegations represent discrete and poorly considered decisions, such as allegedly encouraging users to provide phone numbers to better secure their accounts, but then using those same numbers for advertising without telling users beforehand. Others appear to reflect Facebook \u2019s willingness to deceive its users outright, such as allegedly telling the public that it would not share  ...\n Then came a stern warning:\u00a0\u201cIn the event that the parties return to this Court because the United States alleges\u2014once again\u2014that Facebook has reneged on its promises and continued to violate the law or the terms of the amended administrative order, the Court may not apply quite the same deference to the terms of a proposed resolution.\n In other words, this had better be the end of Facebook\u2019s shenanigans, or the FTC won\u2019t be the only one to drop the hammer.\n But Kelly was also crystal clear that he thinks there are deeper problems that the legislative branch should considering solving.\n \u201cAnd these allegations, and the briefs of some amici, call into question the adequacy of laws governing how technology companies that collect and monetize Americans\u2019 personal information must treat that information. But those concerns are largely for Congress; they are not relevant here,\u201d the judge wrote.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 04:29:49", "tags": "facebook,\u6cd5\u5b98,judge", "title":

"note_en": "After 14 years running my own businesses, I \u2019ve failed a lot. I haven \u2019t kept count thankfully, but I \u2019d say I \u2019ve started at least 50 businesses / ideas and out of those, 3 have worked. And when I say worked I don \u2019t mean staying in business, I mean resulting in either a decent income for me at the time or a decent asset that \u2019s worth something to me or someone else. With all the risks you take as an entrepreneur, I don \u2019t see replacing your job and getting to work from home as a significant  ...\n The startup community likes to glorify failure but I don\u2019t. Failing sucks. Failing slow sucks infinitely more. That\u2019s why it\u2019s OK sometimes to give up, to free you up to move onto an idea that could bring you something that the startup community doesn\u2019t talk about near as much: actual fulfilment and success.\n  Knowing when to give up is near impossible and the emotional baggage that comes with making the decision to give up is unbearable. That\u2019s why entrepreneurs, myself included, waste years of their lives on shitty ideas that will never work, following the popular trend of \u201cideas don\u2019t matter, only execution matters\u201d.\n  Ideas matter a lot, and if yours is a shitty one, for you, at that time, with the resources you have, it will almost certainly fail.\n Here is a list of things to look out for when things might be set for failure. These are based on my failures and the failures I\u2019ve seen around my circles (mostly self-funded online business folk).\n  Being willing to go into something you are clueless about can be a great trait for an entrepreneur, but only to a point. Sometimes entrepreneurs overshoot, I \u2019ve done it myself. I started a business selling kids toys without any experience in retail or without knowing anything about kids, I tried to start a business making pot plant stands despite not being a gardener and having zero experience in manufacturing, I tried to build an app for surfers despite being a terrible surfer and having  ...\n If I think about the ideas that have worked for me, I\u2019ve been able to utilise a lot of my existing skills to make them work. And where my skills weren\u2019t enough, I\u2019ve worked with other skilled people as partners to pull it off.\n Over the years, I\u2019ve seen so many people try to start businesses, especially online businesses and apps etc without any clue what they are doing. Successful software startups are almost always started by well connected, super smart entrepreneurs in big startup hub cities, or people who are really great software engineers themselves. It\u2019s extremely rare for an individual who isn\u2019t a programmer to think up a software idea and turn that into a successful company.\n Yet people try all the time (myself included) and wonder why it doesn\u2019t work out. Your chances go up a lot when you stick with something you know extremely well, or at the very least have co-founders who know the field very well and your skills are equally valuable.\n  I used to do this all the time, with 4 or 5 ideas bubbling away at once all the time. Lots of people do the same thing. I think they heard some generic advice that said millionaires have on average 7 different income streams, and they think that means they have to have 7 businesses. I can tell you 1 great business is a hell of a lot more valuable than 7 shit ones. It\u2019s near impossible to split your time, attention and dedication across multiple projects.\n It\u2019s also very hard to avoid those entrepreneurial impulses, particularly when one project isn\u2019t going well, it\u2019s tempting to dabble in a few at once. But I claim at least temporary success at battling this impulse. I stopped doing it about 3 years ago.\n My last business suffered immensely because of this. Both me and my co-founder worked on multiple projects while running the business. In the end, none of our side projects did very well at all, and the approach took a toll on the main business.\n I took these lessons into my current (only) business  Black Hops Brewing. Once I started working full time at Black Hops, I shut down all of my other personal projects. One of them was generating $40-$50k a year in relatively passive income which was more than I was getting as a wage via Black Hops at the time. I switched it, and all of my projects off to focus on Black Hops.\n And it was the right decision. I haven\u2019t thought about any other projects since we started and Black Hops has grown into one of the countries fastest growing breweries and one of the state\u2019s largest independent breweries. Size wise it\u2019s already 6-7 times the revenue of my last business, and it\u2019s worth 8-10 times as much after less than 4 years.\n It pays to focus, especially if you really believe in the thing you are focusing on. Turning down lower value opportunities for higher value ones is something great entrepreneurs do all the time.\n  This might come across as harsh but have you had a really good think about whether you are the right person for this particular idea at this particular time? I think sometimes people look up to these outlier heroes who started amazing outlier companies and think they can do it as well. It\u2019s OK to have some ambition, but it has to be tempered with some level of self awareness.\n Steve Jobs famously said \u201cLife can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.\u201d This is a neat inspirational quote, but is it actually true?\n I\u2019m a reasonably smart person, when I went to school I was slightly above average for my school. I got a good enough grade to get into Business at university and went on to start a few of my own businesses. But what about all the kids that were smarter than me at school do?\n When I look around, I see amazing houses that were designed by Architects after acing school, getting through a gruelling 5 years at university, a further 2 years in monitored practice, passing the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia exam then probably worked under an amazing Architect with 20-30 years experience for 5 years at least before they designed the house I \u2019m looking at. The roads and the bridges and the buildings are the same, built by engineers who were  ...\n Businesses in many ways are not that much different. The successful restaurants are normally started by the industry \u2019s best and most award-winning chefs, software apps are created by some of the smartest entrepreneurs and software engineers in capital-rich startup hubs like Silicon Valley. Have you ever listened to an interview with any of the founders of any of the major tech giants of our generation? Zuckerberg is a computing genius, an insanely aggressive risk taker, he  ...\n Not to say there\u2019s no place for you and me in a world filled with access and enormous opportunity. But should we be trying to start the next Facebook? Probably not the right people for the job.\n  I \u2019ve noticed a lot of younger entrepreneurs have a strong social conscience, which is a great thing. But the idea of starting a charity of sorts that \u2019s also a business is a tricky one to get my head around. There are certainly examples of companies who have been started with a strong social conscience that have also been fantastic businesses. But for every one of those, there \u2019s way more companies that seem to make a lot of vague claims about donating a \u201c% of profit \u201dto  ...\n When I think about entrepreneurs who have given large amounts to causes, the ones I think of like Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos etc were all ridiculously successful business people first, and philanthropists later. Many, like Gates, were well known for being ruthlessly competitive, happily monopolising industries and obliterating competitors. These guys were hard entrepreneurs, driven by creating revolutionary products and making shitloads of money.\n And that \u2019s completely fine as far as I \u2019m concerned, that \u2019s what entrepreneurs are supposed to do. If you can build some good natured help for people in need into your business model (or more importantly your brand), then go for it. But it should be a business first. There is a lot of nobility in starting a business that entrepreneurs often don \u2019t get credit for. Small businesses power our economies, they support families, they employ tax paying citizens and they pay their  ...\n  Marketing is the biggest problem in business, I should know after failing marketing in Business School and failing at marketing in most of my businesses. Convincing anyone to do something different to what they are currently doing is near impossible. I know you know this, as business owners we know when we have a good product or service or event or app or restaurant, we look around at our competitors and size them up and feel like our offering is just as good if not better.  ...\n In my circles of mainly self funded smaller businesses, we don\u2019t have the big budgets to acquire customers with paid ad spend. Even if we could, we don\u2019t have the analytics to know if the money is well spent or not. Figuring all of that out is expensive and it takes time. So normally what we do is we build a nice brand and a nice story around what we do.\n In my case my last business I had this ongoing (very real) story about an entrepreneur who failed for 7 years and then started a neat little productised service business in 7 days.\n The fact that it was 7 years of failure and 7 days to success was pure luck. The fact that the entrepreneur was me was even luckier.\n The business would offer unlimited WordPress fixes for a fixed monthly fee, the first of its kind with this type of idea. It took off. My failure story turned into a success story, and me and my co-founder used that story and momentum to build a nice business which we sold to GoDaddy less than 3 years later.\n With my current business, it\u2019s a similar story (but way better). 3 guys sat around at a bar discussing brewing ideas, we decided to have a crack at one of the ideas and after realising it was a hit, we took the plunge and built our own brewery (with a lot of other cool shit happening along the way, which we happily accepted into  our story).\n In both causes we took our community and our audience along with us as we built the business, and we built the businesses while spending close to $0 on advertising.\n But this wasn\u2019t about us geniuses thinking up a cool story and using it as a branding exercise. We just happened to find ourselves inside a great story. We were of course very happy to use that and be part of it and make it the centrepiece of our marketing.\n For these 2 businesses I \u2019ve got enormous amounts of free marketing and publicity over the years. We \u2019ve had international attention from the likes of Activision (Call of Duty \u2019s first official beer), TechCrunch, Fox news, Mashable and more. We \u2019ve had local attention including featuring on an episode of a TV show on Channel 9, being on 9 News and 7 News and the Gold Coast Bulletin and the Courier Mail and more. None of that cost us a cent, and without that kind  ...\n But what if you don\u2019t have that luxury? What if you don\u2019t find yourself inside a great story. I guess you could make it up, an approach that makes me ill to think about, but a lot of companies do it and it works for some. But I like to think most consumers see through it. The more likely outcome is the business won\u2019t gain traction. You\u2019ll miss out on the easiest solution to businesses biggest problems.\n It\u2019s not great, but maybe it means you have to search out for an idea where you will find yourself inside a cool story.\n  One of the biggest traps for new entrepreneurs is they try to change the world too soon. They are inspired by entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk and they want to be \u2018disruptive\u2019 and \u2018make a dent in the universe\u2019.\n Being inspired is great and super important, I\u2019m also very inspired by these people and have been over many years. But trying to change too much is a struggle that most entrepreneurs aren\u2019t ready for.\n Can you imagine the gargantuan task of convincing people who have driven petrol cars all their life to no longer buy petrol cars? Can you imagine being a startup car maker and competing against iconic companies that people tie their identities to? Competing against companies who have more than a century of lessons and innovation and brand building to fall back on? You want people to ignore all of that and buy a golf buggy?\n That\u2019s what Elon faced when forming Tesla. It takes a special type of crazy person (meant in the most endearing way), to even think something like that would be possible.\n Elon made it happen with a shitload of money, a very healthy dose of luck, and because he\u2019s a once in a generation entrepreneur.\n Most people don\u2019t make this happen. Most good solid companies are started with a slight point of difference, a cool story, a good brand and a well timed offering. They won\u2019t drastically change people\u2019s buying behavior. This is especially true for underfunded entrepreneurs, who already have an enormous marketing challenge just to make people aware that they exist.\n As far as making people completely change their habits as a consumer? Good luck with that. Much better to provide a solution where customers are already paying for a solution.\n  At the risk of repeating everything I said in  The 7 Day Startup, it\u2019s a very bad idea to make decisions based on assumptions instead of actual customer data. A founder\u2019s only goal in starting a new business should be to get a viable product or service into the customers\u2019 hands as soon as possible.\n This is a roadblock that new entrepreneurs have a huge issue with. It\u2019s so much easier to just post a link in a Facebook group and ask for feedback, or jump on a mastermind call and discuss what hypothetically the customer might want.\n I don \u2019t want to downplay this mistake because it \u2019s an excruciatingly difficult challenge. It \u2019s not as simple as putting out a shit product and hoping for the best. Products have to be good (viable), if they don \u2019t look good and feel good and solve a proper problem and provide a different enough experience to what people are used to (without changing major behaviours), then they probably aren \u2019t viable. So how do you create something with all of those  ...\n But the alternative is pissing around for months, or years on \u2018potential \u2019ideas fabricating hypothetical scenarios in your head based on assumptions, that only delay the inevitable. Having customers tell you they hate your idea, or not pay for it, or even worse, not being able to find customers, really sucks. But there \u2019s something that sucks way harder. Spending months or years of your life on the wrong idea and ultimately having it fail. I \u2019ve done  ...\n  This one shouldn\u2019t come as a huge surprise, but there does have to be something interesting about your product or service offering. It doesn\u2019t have to be a major change, in fact massive changes could do a lot more harm than good, it just has to be worth talking about. When I look back at my failed ideas, they weren\u2019t particularly interesting. When I look at the few that have gone well, they\u2019ve all had some little point of difference.\n And the thing that is interesting has to be interesting to the customer, not just to you. This is why I think sometimes it\u2019s a bad idea for entrepreneurs to \u201cscratch their own itch\u201d. It\u2019s super easy to be interested in your own shit. It\u2019s way harder to get people to part with their money to purchase something that they were otherwise not planning on purchasing. There has to be something in your idea that is interesting to talk about.\n In my case my WordPress support business was the first of its kind to offer a monthly recurring fixed price service that was traditionally either invoiced hourly or quoted for larger jobs. It\u2019s not a massive change, I was doing WordPress support for years and years before WP Curve. But I\u2019d never done human services for a fixed monthly cost, and others in the industry hadn\u2019t done much of it either, and that idea was interesting.\n In the brewing world I can apply the same methodology. The brewers that have done well all have something interesting about what they are doing. Whether it\u2019s a cool founding story, excellent branding that grabs attention, or just awesome experimental beers that drive people to talk about them. The good ones are all doing something interesting.\n If what you are doing isn \u2019t especially interesting to your customers, it \u2019s going to be very difficult. And if you aren \u2019t sure, look at what your customers are saying about it. And I don \u2019t mean in reply for a testimonial request. Look at the words they use, how they use the product, how they say it \u2019s different, how excited about it are they. That will give you some hints, just be wary of people \u2019s tendency to support their friends and be excited  ...\n  Humans are constantly getting advice from their surroundings, and new entrepreneurs are so easily influenced it really worries me. I see and hear so much awful advice given out to entrepreneurs in Facebook groups, and in mentoring sessions, and from friends and family etc. New entrepreneurs take it all in.\n Fuck advice. You don\u2019t need it. You need awareness, and it\u2019s very difficult to cultivate, especially when you are a new entrepreneur.\n But since you are seeking some kind of advice (otherwise why would you be reading this), here\u2019s my advice on taking advice:\n If you need advice, give a lot of thought to why. Are you not qualified to do this? Do you not have enough expertise in your founding team? Do you not have the courage to make your own decisions? Do you want to seek permission from someone?\n  Try to avoid taking business advice from people who say they are experts. People who are good at business, spend their time running their businesses, not \u201ceducating\u201d others on how to run theirs.\n Look for category-specific advice. If you find someone who is epic at email marketing, it makes sense to get some advice on that topic, but don\u2019t hero worship someone into thinking they are a suitable person to give you advice on all topics.\n Don\u2019t take the approach of asking questions and taking the answer as a solution. Instead gather data and be an entrepreneur and make your own decisions. The best places to gather data is to talk with your team or co-founders (if you have them), or talk to or observe your customers interacting with your offering.\n Do what feels right, sorry I can\u2019t do better than that but if it feels right it probably is.\n  Firstly thanks for reading this article. Is your business likely to fail? I don\u2019t know, only you can know that but I hope these thoughts help you with that decision. And while I don\u2019t want to glorify failure, moving from an idea that doesn\u2019t work for you to one that does is a beautiful thing. It\u2019s a scary move, but maybe it\u2019s the right move.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 04:29:34", "tags": "\u5546\u4e1a,\u60f3\u6cd5,business", "title":

"note_en": "A rising international force of rebel botanists armed with chalk has taken up street graffiti to highlight the names and importance of the diverse but downtrodden flora growing in the cracks of paths and walls in towns and cities across Europe.  The idea of naming wild plants wherever they go \u2013 which began in France \u2013 has gone viral, with people chalking and sharing their images on social media. More than 127,000 people have  liked a photo of chalked-up tree names in a London suburb, while a  video  ...\n  Presseq told the Guardian: \u201cI wanted to raise awareness of the presence, knowledge and respect of these wild plants on sidewalks. People who had never taken the time to observe these plants now tell me their view has changed. Schools have contacted me since to work with students on nature in the city.\u201d\n France banned pesticide use in parks, streets and other public spaces in 2017 and in gardens from 2019, leading to a surge in awareness of urban wild flowers in the country.\n French botanist and campaigner Sophie Leguil, who lives in London, set up the  More Than Weeds campaign to change perceptions of urban plants in the UK after helping to spread the  Sauvages de  ma rue (\u201cwild things of my street\u201d) chalking campaign in France led by  Tela Botanica. She has won permission to chalk up Hackney\u2019s highways and make chalk trails to highlight the forgotten flora at our feet and is asking other councils to allow the same.\n This week, the Guardian&#39;s Age of Extinction site is looking at biodiversity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.\n Around 55% of the world \u2019s population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. Nature \u2019s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss,  ...\n The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.\n In this special series of reports we&#39;ll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.\n \u201cThe pesticide ban in France has played a major role as it has forced local authorities and mentalities to change, and raised awareness,\u201d said Leguil.\n \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do it on a larger scale, with permission, and I hope to get more authorities interested in creating trails. We talk a lot about plant blindness \u2013 what if putting names on plants could make people look at them in a different way? I despair at how sanitised London has become.  Plants can be managed differently, with benefits \u2013 cost-saving, biodiversity, education.\u201d\n  In the UK it is illegal to chalk anything \u2013 hopscotch, art or botanical names \u2013 on paths or highways without permission, even if it educates, celebrates and fosters interest and knowledge in nature.\n One anonymous London tree name chalker said: \u201cI\u2019ll keep labelling as I go on my daily walks. I think it\u2019s really tapped into where people are right now.\n \u201cBotanical chalking gives a quick blast of nature connection, as the words encourage you to look up and notice the tree above you, the leaves, the bark, the insects, the sky. And that\u2019s all good for mental health. None of us can manage that much \u2013 living through a global pandemic is quite enough to be getting on with. But it\u2019s brought me a great amount of joy.\u201d\n  UK Plantlife spokesman Trevor Dines said the charity could not condone breaking the law, but added: \u201cThe incredible response to graffiti plant names is astonishing and I think it\u2019s part of something profound. It\u2019s as if the plant is declaring its own place in  our world.\n \u201cIn a recent YouGov poll, just 6% of 16- to 24-year-olds were able to correctly name a picture of a wild violet. The same poll showed nearly 70% of respondents would like to be able to identify more wild flowers.\u201d\n  With less spraying and weeding, we might expect to see up to 400 plant species on walls and paths, he suggests. That is 10% of our wild flora richness.\n \u201cOne survey of pavements in Sheffield found 183 different plants, another in Cambridge found 186 species on walls. All these little micro niches build up to a wonderfully complex tapestry,\u201d Dines said.\n \u201cEvery flower counts and will be targeted by pollinators \u2013 a patch of nettles can be swamped with caterpillars. And bird\u2019s-foot-trefoil, a not uncommon urban verge plant, is a food plant for more than 160 different invertebrates. If we change our perceptions and see the dandelion flower for what it is \u2013 an absolute lifeline to our bees in early spring \u2013 we might learn to love them more.\u201d\n A  study by pollinator researchersrevealed that many wild urban \u201cweeds \u201drank very highly for the quantity of nectar and pollen each flower provides, often much higher than a variety of garden plants. The top trumps among the plants they measured included dandelions and their lookalikes \u2013rough hawkbit, cat \u2019s-ear and sow-thistles \u2013plus ragwort, viper \u2019s bugloss, mallows, self-heal, scentless mayweed, love-in-a-mist, wild mignonette, rosebay willowherb, thistles, creeping buttercup and  ...\n  Andrew Whitehouse, of conservation trust Buglife, said path and wall plants are also important as winter food sources when there is less blossom available for insects such as bumblebees. \u201cBelow the concrete, the roots create tiny microhabitats that support woodlice, worms, harvestmen, spiders, baby slugs and snails, which in turn become the food for birds and hedgehogs,\u201d he added.\n Cllr Jon Burke, of Hackney Council, which has gone  pesticide-free in some areasand halved its use overall to increase wild flowers and boost insect biodiversity following public concern, said: \u201cIt is absurd that this chalking of plant names is criminal. It is something we welcome as an important and inspiring teaching tool for adults and children. How else will a kid ever know these names? The vocabulary of the natural world helps us access it, love it and desire to protect it. \u201d ...\n Criminal law expert James Gray of Drystone Chambers confirmed that chalking plant names in the UK is illegal without permission or \u201clawful excuse\u201d and a rebel botanist could be fined up to \u00a32,500 for painting or inscribing any picture, letter, sign, or other mark on a path, highway surface, tree or other structure.\n  Referring to Victor Hugo\u2019s famous fictional police inspector, Gray added: \u201cThe Javerts of this world will see great harm in the scribbles of rogue botanists and call for prosecutions, others will see it as entirely harmless and perhaps even a refreshing diversion in our streets.\u201d\n  He added: \u201cWhere the threshold lies will depend on the attitude of those charged with enforcing the law; beauty (or derangement) is in the eye of the magistrate.\u201d\n Find more  age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters  Phoebe Weston and  Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features", "posttime": "2020-05-04 04:07:31", "tags": "\u690d\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6,botanists,\u690d\u7269,wild", "title": "\u53cd\u53db\u7684\u690d\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6\u6b63\u5728\u7528\u6d82\u9e26\u6765\u547d\u540d\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u690d\u7269\u7fa4\u3002", "title_en": "Rebel botanists are using graffiti to name forgotten flora", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/not-just-weeds-how-rebel-botanists-are-using-graffiti-to-name-forgotten-flora-aoe", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u690d\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6", "botanists", "\u690d\u7269", "wild"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000520, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8981\u7ee7\u7eed\uff0c\u8bf7\u5355\u51fb\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u6846\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u4e0d\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\n\u8bf7\u786e\u4fdd\u60a8\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u652f\u6301JavaScript\u548cCookie\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u60a8\u6ca1\u6709\u963b\u6b62\u5b83\u4eec\u52a0\u8f7d\u3002\u6709\u5173\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u548c\u3002", "note_en": "To continue, please click the box below to let us know you&#39;re not a robot.\n  Please make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not blocking them from loading.

"note_en": "Two weeks into the first Wall Street earnings season that includes COVID-19 data, most big tech companies that operate a large cloud unit have reported results. Judging from the growth rate and revenue numbers alone, the cloud seems to be weathering the coronavirus storm just fine. AWS grew 33% year-over-year and  hit the $10 billion USD quarterly revenue mark for the first time. Azure  grew by 59%, Google Cloud (includes both GCP and GSuite)  grew by 52%, and IBM \u2019s Cloud &amp; Data Platforms category  ...\n But as a full-fledged industry, the cloud is relatively new, even though cloud computing as a form factor and product has been around for more than two decades now.  Loudcloud (later Opsware) and  Rackspace were both founded before the dot com boom busted. AWS  was launched in 2006 with S3, SQS (Simple Queue Service), and EC2.\n The current COVID-19-induced recession, if not depression, will be the first time the cloud computing industry is a meaningful participant of a large-scale economic downturn.\n  (NOTE: in this post, \u201ccloud\u201d means either infrastructure or platform-as-a-service, IaaS or PaaS. It does not include cloud-based SaaS products, where there are too many types and variations.)\n  Before we dive into the analysis, let\u2019s establish some common definitions and a framework first.\n  Wall Street&#39;s somewhat technical financial definition is anything that has a negative beta. In plain terms, it means any security whose price movement is opposite of the stock market\u2019s; if the market goes up, that security goes down, and vice-versa. Gold and U.S. Treasury bonds are the classic examples. Bitcoin is the more edgy, less understood example.\n There\u2019s also a more Main Street way to think about what is recession-proof. It\u2019s anything that people must spend money on, regardless of how bad the economy is and how bad their personal financial situation is. Typically, that means things like utilities (electricity and water), car insurance, and essential consumer products like food and toothpaste.\n Of course, these are all heuristics that do not reflect reality completely. One common heuristic is that alcohol consumption is recession-proof. (You\u2019d want to get drunk when things are good and when things are bad.) However, certain academic study has shown that alcohol consumption  actually decreased during the 2008 Great Recession.\n So how should we evaluate the cloud\u2019s recession-proof-ness? Investopedia\u2019s  five characteristics of a recession-resistant company seems to be a reasonable framework for this exercise, if we imagine each cloud platform to be an independent company. You are a recession-resistant company, if you have  one of the following characteristics:\n  Let\u2019s see if a cloud platform would have one or more of these characteristics.\n  Not really.If anything, cloud platforms are more the consumer of these critical repair services. Given the increasing criticality of the cloud infrastructure to the essential functions of our society, the businesses that do serve the cloud infrastructure, e.g. server and network maintenance, physical security of data centers, etc., may be more recession proof than the cloud itself. Regardless of which cloud is more in demand, and even if the whole industry experiences a categorical  ...\n  No. Certain cloud vendors may be the infrastructure that support the stores that  do sell consumer essentials. Obviously, AWS itself is now the foundation to Amazon.com that  is selling and delivering many of the consumer essentials. But most consumers don\u2019t know, or care, if their essential shopping is happening in the cloud or not. And in an apocalyptic scenario where the entire Internet economy collapses, people will adap and buy essential goods from brick and mortar options.\n  Probably yes. The customer base of the cloud is broad and diverse, from startups, to larger enterprises from all industries, to governments of all levels and sizes. While some of those customers will suffer during a recession, others will be more in demand for different reasons. Projecting into the future of our current recession, travel companies and airlines won \u2019t be using as much cloud, but Zoom, Slack, and other products used for remote work will use more. Many startups and SMBs  ...\n  Not really. Using the cloud may be a good idea for many businesses, but it\u2019s not border or custom control, financial audits of public companies, or oil pipelines inspection. This category of recession proof services are typically attached to specific laws or regulations that require they happen regularly, no matter what\u2019s happening to the economy. Using the cloud is a business choice, by no means a requirement or mandate.\n  Quite possibly. This is a tricky one. What happens on a cloud platform is powered by a mixture of open source and proprietary technology. Some of the data center designs are open sourced as a part of the Open Compute Project. Most of the hardwares is acquired from vendors selling proprietary technologies. Most of the fundamental software components are open sourced at their core, but tied together with proprietary code that works differently in one cloud versus another. The core  ...\n  If you don\u2019t find this analysis unsatisfying, you are not alone. I\u2019m not either. (And if you came to this post looking for recession proof stock picks, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you.) There isn\u2019t an established category of recession proof businesses that fully captures all dimensions of the cloud industry.\n The cloud is part utilities, part commercial real estate, part railroad, and part something new that warrants its own framework.  (I welcome your input to develop a better analytical framework together.)\n There are also few data points that can help us understand and model how cloud platforms will perform during a recession. This COVID-19 recession will be the first one.\n Lastly, even if we do have a framework and enough information to establish that cloud platforms are indeed recession proof, it\u2019s hard to invest in them in a targeted way. All the big cloud vendors are parts of bigger tech conglomerates. And the financials around their cloud units are inconsistent and convoluted -- Microsoft, Google, IBM, Oracle all have their own definition and \u201cspin\u201d on what should be considered \u201ccloud\u201d, which is  a point of frustration I\u2019ve written about  many  ...\n Until Amazon decides to break AWS away into a separate entity, or when a cloud startup like  Digital Ocean eventually go public, just investing in cloud computing platforms in the public market is difficult. The best you can do is invest in one of the big tech companies with a cloud or a data center colocation company like Equinix.\n All the dissatisfactions aside, how the entire cloud industry will fare during this current crisis is worth watching and learning from, if only to prepare for the next recession. And there will be another recession.\n If you like what you&#39;ve read, please  SUBSCRIBE to the Interconnected email list. New posts will be delivered to your inbox (twice per week).

"note_en": "The median price paid for an existing, single-family home in the Bay Area fell in 2019 for the first full year since 2011, according to data from the California Association of Realtors.\n  The median price, the point at which half of homes sold for more and half for less, fell to $928,000, down 2.3% from $950,000 in 2018.\n  Forces pushing prices up \u2014 the region\u2019s booming economy, chronic housing shortage and a hotly anticipated flood of initial public offerings \u2014 were offset by negative factors, including strained affordability, outmigration to cheaper locales and shrinking federal tax breaks for homeownership.\n  The association\u2019s numbers do not include condominiums, new construction and homes that were not entered into a multiple listing service.\n  Of the nine Bay Area counties, Santa Clara had the biggest price drop, 5.6%. However, it had been the strongest the year before, rising 13.5%, said Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst with Compass, a real estate brokerage.\n  Oakland-Berkeley was the strongest submarket last year, attracting buyers seeking an \u201curban ambience\u201d at a lower cost than San Francisco, he said.\n  Abio Properties agent Shannon Prokup was stunned when a home she listed on Ashby Avenue in Berkeley attracted more than 400 people at open houses last Saturday and Sunday. The home has two bedrooms, one bathroom and 1,100 square feet; it is priced at $825,000. \u201cI was not expecting that kind of turnout,\u201d she said. But \u201cthere is not a ton on the market under a million dollars. And interest rates are still low.\u201d\n  Prices in all of Alameda County, however, fell 2.1% last year. Prices were also down in Marin, San Mateo and Sonoma counties but up slightly in Contra Costa, Napa and Solano counties. San Francisco\u2019s median price, $1.6 million, was dead even with 2018.\n  The median price in San Francisco hit a high in the second quarter of 2019, \u201cprobably driven by IPO hype,\u201d Carlisle said.\n     A string of large San Francisco companies went public, starting with Levi Strauss and Lyft in March, Pinterest in April, Uber in May and Slack in June. Most employees of these companies, except for Slack, which sold shares in a direct listing, were prohibited from selling their shares for up to six months.\n  In March and April, \u201cA bunch of people said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to sell now, I\u2019ll wait until the millionaires come out.\u2019 Then there were buyers who said, \u2018We need to buy now before we are competing with all these millionaires,\u2019\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cThe second quarter got exacerbated by the sellers waiting for the millionaires and buyers trying to beat millionaires to the market.\u201d\n  And it wasn\u2019t just in San Francisco. \u201cThe rush happened before everything went IPO,\u201d said Linnette Edwards, co-founder of Abio Properties in the East Bay. \u201cI had buyers who were adamant about buying before the IPOs,\u201d including one couple that was expecting a baby. \u201cThey called it baby IPO,\u201d she said.\n     Jason Buttorf, a Compass agent in San Francisco, had a client who works for Slack. He and his wife had been renting in Golden Gate Heights and eyeing homes there for years. In July, shortly after Slack went public, their \u201cdream home\u201d came on the market and they snapped it up for over $2.5 million.\n  By the time fall rolled around, however, the market \u201cwas mysteriously quiet and uneventful,\u201d Buttorf said.\n  Carlisle agreed. \u201cThe hype might have affected (the market) more than the reality,\u201d he said.\n  Prices typically peak in the spring and summer and decline in the fall and winter. On a year-over-year basis, Bay Area home prices did better in the second half than the first, largely because interest rates declined, said Jordan Levine, the Realtor association\u2019s deputy chief economist.\n  But there\u2019s no doubt that the market has cooled. The median price paid for a single-family existing home in the Bay Area fell from $727,000 in 2006 to $430,000 in 2009. It rose to $500,000 in 2010 (thanks in part to a first-time home buyer credit), then dropped again in 2011, to $460,000. After that it embarked on a string of stratospheric increases that brought it to $950,000 in 2018.\n  \u201cAs the economy picked up, home prices in the Bay Area, where the economy was outperforming the state and nation, bounced back very quickly,\u201d Levine said. \u201cAs prices have risen, affordability has become more of a problem, which limits some price appreciation.\u201d\n  Federal tax changes that took effect in 2018 have also \u201cincreased the cost of homeownership compared to what it was in the past,\u201d he added. Congress reduced the mortgage interest deduction on loans originated after 2017 to interest on $750,000 in debt, down from $1 million. It also capped the previously unlimited deduction for all state and local taxes combined, including income and property taxes, at $10,000.\n  \u201cYou are seeing that play a role, particularly in the Bay Area, where most homeowners are going to be impacted by those caps,\u201d Levine said. But, he added, you can\u2019t blame it all on tax changes. \u201cWe have seen the pace of growth slowing for several years.\u201d\n  For the month of December only, the median price paid for a single-family, existing home in the Bay Area was $908,750, down 1.8% from November but up 6.9% from December 2018, according to numbers  released Friday by the Realtors association.\n  \u201cDecember and January are almost always the lowest prices of the year,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cThe whole market is seasonal but the luxury market is fiercely seasonal.\u201d High-end sellers leave for the holidays and take their homes off the market, assuming high-end buyers have also left. As a result, the market gets dominated by lower-end sales, which pulls down the median price.\n  The median price paid for a single-family home in San Francisco fell to $1.45 million in December, down 10.4% from November and down 3.3% from December 2018. That was the worst showing of any Bay Area county.\n  On a year-over-year basis, the December median price was up 3.7% in Alameda County, 8.6% in Contra Costa, 2.3% in Marin, 5.5% in Napa, 6.5% in Santa Clara, 7.2% in Solano and 1.3% in Sonoma. It fell 0.5% in San Mateo.\n  For the state as a whole, Levine predicts that low interest rates will continue to bolster buyer demand but shrinking inventories will keep sales from rising more than 1% or 2% this year. \u201cWe see price growth in the mid-single-digit range.\u201d\n  Whether the Bay Area does better or worse than the state \u201cis a tough call,\u201d he said. The Bay Area \u201chas upward momentum from the demand side,\u201d as job growth keeps unemployment near record lows. But the inventory shortage is even more acute in the Bay Area, \u201cwhich is spilling over to the demand side,\u201d with people leaving the area in search of cheaper housing.\n  Kathleen Pender writes the Net Worth column in The San Francisco Chronicle.

Pender welcomes questions from readers and frequently answers them in her column.\n She majored in business journalism at the University of Missouri-Columbia and was a Knight-Bagehot fellow in business journalism at Columbia University.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 03:22:25", "tags": "\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71,\u6e7e\u533a,\u623f\u4ef7,area,\u4ef7\u683c", "title": "\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u6e7e\u533a\u623f\u4ef7\u4e2d\u503c\u81ea2011\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u9996\u6b21\u5e74\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d", "title_en": "Bay Area median home price first annual drop since 2011", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/networth/article/Bay-Area-median-home-price-fell-2-3-last-year-14985353.php", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71", "\u6e7e\u533a", "\u623f\u4ef7", "area", "\u4ef7\u683c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000516, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6b21\u8981\u7248\u672c\u662f\u4f7fLibrePCB\u529f\u80fd\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u53c8\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\n\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f7f\u521b\u5efa\u5e93\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u539f\u7406\u56fe\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u548c\u7535\u8def\u677f\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u73b0\u5728\u5206\u522b\u5141\u8bb8\u641c\u7d22\u7b26\u53f7\u3002\u8bbe\u5907(#671)\uff1a\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u957f\u5ea6\u503c(\u7ebf\u5bbd\u3001\u94bb\u5b54\u76f4\u5f84\u3001\u5750\u6807\u7b49)\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u5b57\u6bb5\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u663e\u793a\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5355\u5143\u4e2d(#684)\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u57df\u7684\u5355\u4f4d\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u5355\u72ec\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u6062\u590d\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u5b66\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u9644\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d(\u4f8b\u5982\u201cmm\u201d)\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5bf9\u5176\u6c42\u503c\uff1a\n\u6b64\u7248\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u62fe\u53d6\u4e0e\u653e\u7f6eCSV\u6587\u4ef6\u5bfc\u51fa(#639)\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64LibrePCB\u73b0\u5728\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c06\u7531\u62fe\u53d6\u4e0e\u653e\u7f6e\u673a\u5668\u7ec4\u88c5\u7684PCB\uff1a\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u539f\u7406\u56fe\u548c\u7535\u8def\u677f(#656)\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SVG\u5bfc\u51fa\u3002\u8fd9\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u77e2\u91cf\u56fe\u5f62\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u4e3a\u5404\u79cd\u76ee\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\n\u00b1propos\u6587\u4ef6\u5bfc\u51fa\uff1aBOM CSV\u5bfc\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u7528\u9017\u53f7\u5206\u9694\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5206\u53f7\u5206\u9694(#678)\u3002\u8fd9\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0eCSV\u8bfb\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\nLibrePCB 0.1.4\u5bf9\u9879\u76ee\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6240\u6709\u4e4b\u524d\u76840.1.x\u7248\u672c\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b8c\u5168\u517c\u5bb9\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u7248\u672c\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728NetNames\u4e2d\u6709\u6362\u884c\u7b26(#603)\u3002\u8fd9\u57280.1.4\u4e2d\u5df2\u7ecf\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u9884\u671f(\u6216\u5e0c\u671b\u2026)\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u9879\u76ee\u53d7\u5230\u6b64\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5347\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u4ecd\u7136\u9047\u5230\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528LibrePCB 0.1.4\u6253\u5f00\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5219\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u540d\u79f0\u3002\u8bf7\u4e0d\u8981\u72b9\u8c6b\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002\n2020-05-03", "note_en": "This minor release is one more important step to make LibrePCB more powerfuland to improve usability of the user interface.\n   The user interface got many usability improvements to make creating librariesand projects more efficient. For example the schematic- and board editors nowallow searching for symbols resp. devices( #671):\n  Furthermore, all input fields for length values (line width, drill diameter,coordinate etc.) are now displayed in the unit configured in the workspacesettings ( #684). The unit ofeach input field can even be changed individually and gets saved and restoredautomatically. And you can now enter mathematical expressions and optionallyappend a unit (e.g. \u201cmm\u201d) which will then be evaluated:\n   This release adds a pick&amp;place CSV file export( #639) so LibrePCB is nowalso suitable to design PCBs which will be assembled by pick&amp;place machines:\n  In addition, an SVG export has been implemented for both, schematics andboards ( #656). This allows topostprocess them in a vector graphics tool for various purposes.\n \u00c0 propos file export: The BOM CSV export is now comma-separated instead ofsemicolon-separated ( #678).This improves compatibility with CSV readers.\n  LibrePCB 0.1.4 uses exactly the same file format for projects as all previous0.1.x releases and are thus fully compatible.\n However, previous versions had a bug which allowed to have linebreaks in netnames ( #603). This has beenfixed in 0.1.4, and since we expect (or hope\u2026) no projects to be affected bythis bug, no automatic upgrade mechanism has been implemented. If you stillrun into the issue that a project cannot be opened with LibrePCB 0.1.4, theaffected net names need to be fixed manually. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us to get help with the migration.\n                     2020-05-03", "posttime": "2020-05-04 02:16:14", "tags": "\u53d1\u5e03,librepcb,\u73b0\u5728,csv", "title": "LibrePCB 0.1.4\u53d1\u5e03", "title_en": "LibrePCB 0.1.4 Released", "transed": 1, "url": "https://librepcb.org/blog/2020-05-03_release_0.1.4/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u53d1\u5e03", "librepcb", "\u73b0\u5728", "csv"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "20ce961d77376a315371d78f48259bb7.jpg", "infoid": 1000514, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6b63\u5982\u4ed6\u5c0f\u5fc3\u7ffc\u7ffc\u5730\u6307\u51fa\u7684\u90a3\u6837\uff0c\u8fc8\u514b\u5c14\u00b7\u83b1\u7ef4\u7279\u6559\u6388\u4e0d\u662f\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u5bb6\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u65af\u5766\u798f\u5927\u5b66\u533b\u5b66\u9662\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u6559\u6388\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f2013\u5e74\u8bfa\u8d1d\u5c14\u5316\u5b66\u5956\u83b7\u5f97\u8005\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u83b7\u5956\u4f5c\u54c1\u662f\u201c\u590d\u6742\u5316\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u201d\u3002\u4ece\u7eaf\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u4ed6\u81ea1\u6708\u4efd\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u5bc6\u5207\u5173\u6ce8\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u6211\u4eec\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u751a\u81f3\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\u4ed6\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u53d1\u8a00\u662f\u57282\u6708\u521d\uff0c.", "note_en": "As he is careful to point out, Professor Michael Levitt is not an epidemiologist.

"note_en": "We have contacted Nir Erez, the founder and CEO of Moovit, as well as Intel spokespeople for a comment on the reports and will update this story as we learn more. For now, Moovit\u2019s spokesperson has not denied the reports and what we have been told directly.\n \u201cAt this time we have no comment, but if anything changes I\u2019ll definitely let you know,\u201d Moovit\u2019s spokesperson.\n  Sources tell TechCrunch that the startup \u2014 which had previously been backed by Intel Capital in a  strategic investment \u2014 will become part of Intel\u2019s Israeli automotive hub, which is anchored by Mobileye, the autonomous driving company that  Intel acquired for $15.3 billion in 2017.\n It\u2019s not clear yet what Moovit would be doing in that hub, but as a rule, ingesting and actioning reliable, real-time traffic data and intelligent routing \u2014 the crux of what Moovit does \u2014 are some of the most challenging aspects of getting autonomous vehicle services up and running.\n And in fact, Moovit had already been working with Mobileye and Intel: the latter led Moovit\u2019s last round of funding, a  Series D of $50 million in 2018, and as part of that, Professor Amnon Shashua, Senior Vice President of Intel and CEO / CTO of Mobileye, joined\u00a0 Moovit\u2019s Board of Directors as an observer.\n Bringing on talent and integrating it into Intel\u2019s bigger strategy appears to be a big part of the deal. Of the $1 billion, employees will get about 10% of the final amount as part of a retention package, a detail both reported by Israeli Hebrew-language newspaper  The Marker and passed to us by David Bedussa, an analyst with Wadi Ventures.\n At the time of Moovit\u2019s last funding round, the startup was valued at over $500 million, but it has grown a lot in the last two years.\n It produces a popular, standalone app that people use to figure out the best way to navigate around cities, and it also integrates with the  likes of Uber in its efforts to provide multi-modal routes using different forms of transportation from Uber cars and bikes to using public transport and walking.\n In 2018, Moovit said its\u00a0 iOS,  Android and\u00a0 Web\u00a0apps were used by 120 million people globally across 2,000 cities in 80 countries. Now in 2020, that figure is over \u00a0800 million riders across 3,100 cities in 102 countries and 45 languages.\n Other investors in Moovit in addition to Intel include BMW, Sound Ventures, Gemini Israel, Sequoia Israel and LVMH.\n The acquisition (if it goes through, but also the M&amp;A interest) comes at a critical moment in the world of transportation. Currently, many people around the world are being asked to curtail their movement to slow down the spread of COVID-19 cases in what has become a global pandemic; and partly as a result of that same public health crisis, the global economy has been in a major downswing. Both have had a direct impact on the automotive world, which is seeing a slowdown in production  ...\n At the same time, those in the world of tech have been working on leveraging their assets in as optimised a way as possible to help keep things moving (so to speak).\n So, while consumer usage of Moovit\u2019s app will have drastically dropped off with people moving around less, the company has  launched a series of COVID-19 services to help those that still need to keep things operational, and still need to get from A to B.\n These have included a special service for transit data managers (which it\u2019s offering for free, unlike its normal B2B products) to both receive updated transit and traffic data and subsequently put in place \u201c thousands of \u00a0short-term changes quickly, enabling riders to plan their trips with only updated, valid routes.\u201d\n It has also started a real-time service for Moovit app users to make sure that they are getting those alerts. Thirdly, it has launched an \u201cemergency\u00a0mobilisation \u00a0on-demand\u201d service that lets transportation managers redeploy buses on routes more quickly to better serve essential workers that are still using public transport.\n It\u2019s not clear if Moovit had been working on raising more money, or if it had been feeling the same pinch that so many other startups have felt when it comes to closing deals, or if this was just an offer too good to refuse, or even if it was on the table before COVID-19. Given Moovit\u2019s existing size and scope, it\u2019s a business that looks like it will be worth running for some time to come.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 01:31:52", "tags":

"note_en": "Lindsay M. Chervinsky, Ph.D., is a historian at the  White House Historical Association. Her book,   The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution will be published by Harvard University Press on April 7, 2020. Follow her on Twitter:  @lmchervinsky.\n  I \u2019ve always been fascinated by how individuals can influence policy, government, and events. At no time did a small group of people have more power over the development of government and events than in the 1790s when there were five people in the cabinet. Sure there are plenty of books on Jefferson, Hamilton, and their tempestuous relationship, but I wanted to know where the institution came from. It \u2019s not in the Constitution, no additional legislation created the body, and everything I read  ...\n When I decided to tackle this question, I spent some time exploring the governors \u2019councils in the state governments, the British cabinet, and the councils of war in the Continental Army during the Revolution. But there was no avoiding that I really had to get into the minds of Washington and the department secretaries in order to understand their interactions and the development of the institution. While I didn \u2019t really realize it at the time (after all, writing a dissertation and then your  ...\n One: I read a ton of biographies. I wanted to know what other authors had written about their personalities, what evidence they were using to back up their arguments, and how these books were similar or different. Plus, when I actually started digging into the archival material, I already had a sense of the narrative arc and that really helped me keep my facts straight.\n Two: I searched the letters of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, and President George Washington to find any mention of a cabinet meeting. I quickly learned that Washington refused to use the word cabinet during his presidency and instead referred to them as \u201cthe gentlemen of my family\u201d or \u201cthe secretaries.\u201d By documenting when the cabinet met, I could determine patterns, moments of crisis, and when gatherings subsided.\n Three: I tracked down remaining letters from the other secretaries to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing any meetings on my master list.\n Four: I dug into the correspondence and notes to try and get a sense of the  character of the meetings. Thankfully, Hamilton and Jefferson kept copious notes about the cabinet meetings and Washington \u2019s letters sometimes hint at discomfort or unpleasantness. For example, Washington would sometimes invite the secretaries to join him for a family dinner after a meeting. He didn \u2019t say why, but we know it wasn \u2019t because Hamilton and Jefferson were the best of pals. I began to hypothesize  ...\n  One really important part of this process was comparing the notes. Hamilton would often write a quick outline of the meeting \u2019s progress and then include notes about what he wanted to say or the speech he wanted to give. In Jefferson \u2019s notes, however, he would write, \u201cHamilton made a jury speech of three-quarters of an hour, as inflammatory and declamatory as if he had been speaking to a jury. \u201dThe next day, Jefferson picked up where he left off: \u201cMet again. Hamilton spoke again three-quarters  ...\n Five: Once I started to speculate about how they might have felt about each other, the room where they were meeting, and more, I explored social customs and conventions at the time. I looked into how they dressed, how they might have postured themselves, expectations of privacy, etc. I \u2019m a big believer that you should start a new project exploring the historiography, but then you often have to return to it again once you have your evidence and further consider how the little details  ...\n Six: I \u2019ve made this process sound super mathematical until this point, and it \u2019s true that I tried to be really methodical about my approach to finding and documenting cabinet meetings. But history isn \u2019t math and there isn \u2019t always an equation. I found that I got to a point where I felt like I knew them. I trusted myself to fill in some of the fuzzy details. I try and be very clear about what I know for sure based on evidence and what I don \u2019t, but I \u2019m not afraid to share what I  ...\n I took this leap of faith when writing about Secretary of State Edmund Randolph \u2019s resignation after the other secretaries had accused him of selling state secrets to France. Their correspondence is fairly well documented and Randolph wrote a pamphlet defending his actions, but none of the players ever wrote about their emotions. Leaning on what I knew about honor culture (mostly from Joanne Freeman), Washington \u2019s sensitivity to scandal and desire to retire, and the written material,  ...\n By the time I wrote the section about Randolph, which was one of the final parts of the book, I felt I had mastered the material as much as one can ever really understand events that came before our time. It was exciting and important to me that I share that knowledge with others. It might have been easier to just say \u201chere \u2019s what happened, here \u2019s what they wrote. \u201dBut I think that \u2019s far less interesting and tells an incomplete story. The whole point of writing a book is to share  ...\n [1] Thomas Jefferson,  The Complete Anas of Thomas Jefferson, ed. Franklin B. Sawvel.

"note_en": "As we continue to stay physically distant from one another, it can be hard to feel socially present with the tools we have. Even with  Zoom and other more  casual chat apps, video chat can feel sort of flat. (And for those of us lucky enough to be working from home, visiting friends after work with the same tools we use to  do work stuffdoesn \u2019t always feel great.) More often than not, we sit, stationary at our designated video-chat-spot, trade reports from self-quarantine and maybe drag in a cat  ...\n But even untethered from our desks with more playful video chat apps or innovations like Facebook\u2019s Portal and its roving eye, there\u2019s still something  else that doesn\u2019t get conveyed. With flat screens, we have little sense of our physical selves in relation to one another. Socializing spatially, as it turns out, is something we probably took for granted. But the gaming world has understood this for years.\n  Now more than ever, we need creative ways to feel present with other people. The whole crisis looks like a huge opportunity for the gaming industry, but also one for more transcendent digital social experiences that don\u2019t just look like playing a few rounds of Call of Duty after work. Hopefully, these experiences could be so imaginative that we don\u2019t even know what they could look like yet.\n If VR had delivered on its early promise, we\u2019d all probably be  living in it right now. The idea of having some kind of shared virtual realm is still a potent one, but the additional hardware has proven too prohibitive to get the average person on board (for now, at least) and even the coolest VR experiences remain niche. Still, it\u2019s clear that we want to come together, not just in Instagram DMs and email threads, but as avatars navigating shared spaces. Somehow.\n   If the mainstream crossover success of Animal Crossing is any indication, people have a huge appetite for virtual spaces right now. Even with Nintendo\u2019s truly painful online multiplayer experience, there\u2019s something fun and special about visiting a friend, bopping each other with nets and showing them your new digs.\n In Animal Crossing, this is truly a more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts experience. The last time I genuinely laughed and  could not stopwas visiting my younger sister \u2019s Animal Crossing island right after the game launched. In spite of the interface \u2019s few emotes and harsh character limits, her weird sense of humor managed to bubble up through the game \u2019s limitations. And those constraints made it more special, for some reason. When I left her island I felt a pang of sadness at leaving her funny  ...\n These experiences are happening on an individual level, but also a collective one\u2014and people are getting creative. One of the writers from Rogue One just made his own  in-game Animal Crossing talkshow, complete with its own tiny guest couch and cityscape view.\n  A developer in New York even launched a dev conference that took place entirely on an Animal Crossing island. Much like a normal conference, \u201c Deserted Island DevOps\u201d boasted speakers, moderators and even talks to be uploaded to YouTube after the fact.\n Plenty of players are using Animal Crossing for more intimate get-togethers too, like celebrating  Ramadan and  Passover last month or just gathering far-flung friends or family together in one place.\n Thanks to everyone who came out to yet another  @animalcrossing Suhoor. It was super lovely to talk to and meet all of you from all around the world &lt;3  pic.twitter.com/G9a8SNTFe0\n  The pandemic is showing us that the sweet spot of mainstream virtual presence might be something more than a Zoom-like video conference but less than a full-on virtual reality experience. Video games, or more specifically video games as  platforms, seem to be resonating right now, even among the kinds of people who wouldn\u2019t identify as gamers. That last bit is important.\n This is something that Fortnite maker Epic Games has been doing right for a while now. There\u2019s a reason that Fortnite, like Animal Crossing, brought non-gamers into the fold. Sure, Fortnite is fun and addictive, but lots of games are fun and addictive\u2014and Fortnite is much harder than a lot of those games.\n Epic\u2019s real innovation is its buttery-smooth social layer that seamlessly connects players across platforms. If you can talk a friend into downloading an app, you\u2019re in business. Of course, other games get this right too (Minecraft comes to mind, of course, and others) but timing is everything right now. And Fortnite\u2019s team is cleverly iterating on its already-good ideas.\n  This week, Epic added a new deliberately chill game mode called Party Royale to Fortnite \u2014a new island just for hanging out with friends. Littered with appropriately zany non-lethal weapons like throwable hamburgers and paintball guns, Party Royale is a designated space where you can take a group and chat while doing mindless yet amusing nonsense, like awkwardly kicking a soccer ball around (I did this with a total stranger for 20 minutes for some reason!) or driving virtual ATVs  ...\n And like much of Epic \u2019s battle royale hit, the island itself is over-the-top weird, stocked with everything from a pirate ship to a music festival grounds awash in colorful lights, gigantic neon dancers and a very psychedelic vibe, molly not included. There \u2019s even a drive-in movie screen, like another area of the main game, which could signal interesting things to come. If we \u2019re lucky and Epic expands it out, Fortnite \u2019s newest casual online virtual space could evolve into something  ...\n Fortnite is a game ostensibly about killing people before they kill you, but it\u2019s also a concert venue\u2014and that hints at Epic\u2019s deeper ideas about the game as a versatile social platform. The game held its latest big in-game show event last month, this time featuring a skyscraper-height Travis Scott who performed as he stormed around a bucolic-turned-kaleidoscopic version of the Fortnite map.  12 million people tuned in, besting the 10 million who played during the more modest  Marshmello  ...\n   For anyone who\u2019s spent any time in massively multiplayer online role-playing games ( MMORPGs), this will all sound familiar. These games have long, vibrant history of drawing huge numbers of people together into persistent shared virtual spaces and letting them express themselves. Curating outfits, decorating spaces and even making choices around playstyle and faction affiliation are all ways to express aspects of who you are and what you \u2019re about in a virtual world populated by  ...\n During its  peak ten years ago, World of Warcraft had as many active subscribers as players who tuned into the Travis Scott event\u201412 million. Since then, gaming exploded into the mainstream and by late 2018, Fortnite boasted almost  80 million active players. Online multiplayer itself bounded forward too, mostly through the success of blockbuster first-person shooters \u2014usually grim, well-funded and vaguely or overtly militaristic games that routinely court one kind of gamer. Playful,  ...\n The wild popularity of  Minecraft carved out a path for cooperative gaming not just because building stuff is incredibly fun, though that\u2019s true too, but because doing anything new with friends in a virtual space is really cool. Scrappier games like the incredible  No Man\u2019s Skycould do for exploration what Minecraft did for building, but with an indie developer \u2019s budget, big ideas about multiplayer play can only get so far. Historically, the lion \u2019s share of industry resources  ...\n There\u2019s a big opportunity right now for games offering a common social experience that\u2019s magnetic enough to draw in the kind of people who don\u2019t even play games. For those of us stuck at home, imaginative gaming worlds offer not just their usual escape from the moment\u2019s stresses, but a way to share space when we can\u2019t come together.", "posttime":

It can be used both with interactive whiteboards or in a dual-screen setup with a pen-tablet display and a beamer.\n  OpenBoard was originally forked from Open-Sankor\u00e9 2.0, which was itself based on Uniboard. This fork was created to refocus the software on its original core functionalities and values, that is the work of a teacher in a classroom, privileging the ease of use. The evolution of this software will therefore take place in accordance with these core principles.\n    Currently, OpenBoard is maintained by the Education Department (DIP) of the canton of Geneva, in Switzerland. The University of Lausanne, who developped the original Uniboard software in 2003 has joined the effort by means of a logistical and financial contribution. An association project will be developed in 2019.\n A meeting was held in June 2016 between representatives from the universities of Lausanne, Neuch\u00e2tel, Fribourg and Geneva, the departments of Education from the cantons of Geneva and Jura as well as various institutions from the canton of Vaud (Switzerland) to together reflect on the desired evolution of OpenBoard.\n  Interest is growing fast across Switzerland but also in Europe and North America. A swiss law non-profit organisation should be created. This organisation would promote OpenBoard and its open source development and foster collaboration between interested parties. This in respect of the core principles which led to the creation of this fork, that is the refocusing on the work of a teacher in a classroom, privileging the ease of use.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 00:46:15", "tags": "\u5927\u5b66,\u9762\u5411,interactive,openboard,software", "title": "OpenBoard\uff1a\u9762\u5411\u5b66\u6821\u548c\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u767d\u677f", "title_en": "OpenBoard: Interactive Whiteboard for Schools and Universities", "transed": 1, "url": "http://www.openboard.ch/index.en.html", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u5927\u5b66", "\u9762\u5411", "openboard", "software"]}]
