"note_en": "In an announcement that came completely out of left field for us today, one of the most storied game publishers that had been previously left for dead has been resurrected. We&#39;re talking about  MicroProse, of course, whose last game was 2002&#39;s Grand Prix 4 (released under the Infogrames umbrella).  MicroProse first got its start nearly four decades ago (1982 to be exact), and published many popular games over the years including the  XCOM and Civilization franchises. One of my personal favorites, being a big aviation buff and an unabashed fan of the General Dynamics/ Lockheed-Martin F-16, was Falcon 4.0.\n   The company is now being led by CEO David Lagettiu, while Bill Stealey, who originally founded MicroProse with Sid Meier, will be onboard as a consultant this time around. For those that would like to see some of their favorite MicroProse classics &#34;refreshed&#34; for modern systems, you&#39;re in luck. It will be remastering a number of games, although those specific titles haven&#39;t been revealed at this time.\n   What the reinvigorated company has announced, however, is that it has three new games on deck. The first is Task Force Admiral, which will have you in command of a U.S. Navy WWII (Pacifica Theater) carrier task force. This will be a full 3D simulation game with 90 ship classes and 40 different types of aircraft with realistic ballistics and full damage modeling. The game is being developed by Drydock Dreams.\n   Next up is Second front, which is another WWII-themed game developed by Hexdraw. &#34;Second Front is an accessible WWII turn-based tactical game with more than 40 infantry units and 200 tanks, vehicles and guns,&#34; writes MicroProse. \u201cIt has all the depth of a paper wargame and the ease of a computer simulation. Campaign, scenarios and a complete editor make it an infinite tactical sandbox experience.&#34;\n   Finally, there&#39;s Sea Power, which was developed by Triassic Games. Sea Power shifts to &#34;modern naval conflict campaigns&#34;. In fact, the description of the game gives us some\u00a0 The Hunt For Red October\u00a0vibes:\n  After hostilities have broken out in Central Europe, the race is on as a pressured US Navy escort force battle off Soviet bomber and submarine attacks on a perilous quest to reinforce NATO defenders in Europe. Meanwhile, in the Persian Gulf, the conflict between Iran and Iraq risks escalating into a larger confrontation between superpowers as both sides indiscriminately attack neutral merchant shipping. And in the Norwegian Sea, an outnumbered Soviet surface force challenges the might of a massive US Navy amphibious force bound for occupied Norway...\n  All three of the games will be launching soon via Steam, which you can check out using the follow links:\u00a0 Task Force Admiral,\u00a0 Second Front,\u00a0 Sea Power.", "posttime": "2020-05-06 21:18:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org",

"note_en": "Commentary: One of the best things for your business and your developers is to encourage them to write open source software.\n  Senior executives may not know much about open source, and that&#39;s OK--or, it was. What they  do know is that software is an increasingly critical component of their businesses-- whatever those businesses may be--and that developers write that software. So let&#39;s connect some dots.\n    SlashData recently surveyed over 16,000 developers to see what makes them tick... what they care about. The data is collected in  SlashData&#39;s State of the Developer Nation, though let me give you the tl;dr: 59% of developers contribute to open source software today. Why do they contribute? The top two reasons are: To improve coding skills and because they believe in open source.\n     Though open source has been a core aspect of enterprise computing for at least two decades, the age group that seems most dialed in is the under 24 crowd, according to the SlashData survey. More than 33% of open source contributors are under the age of 24. This makes sense because for years as the developer population has swelled, it has  demographically skewed younger and younger.\n   In tandem, this increasingly open source savvy workforce is twice as likely to be active on Q&amp;A sites like Stack Overflow, sharing and gaining knowledge. That&#39;s knowledge that doesn&#39;t come at the price of a maintenance contract with [insert the name of your least favorite proprietary software vendor]. So your employees want to contribute both code and knowledge--they want to be part of something.\n  Talking to Bert Hubert, founder of  PowerDNS, a supplier of open source DNS software, services, and support, he stressed that an open source project must be &#34;a fun place where people feel that they are learning things, that they&#39;re contributing things, that they&#39;re being valued.&#34; Perhaps not surprisingly, these are the same elements developers expect from their employers. By making open source a valued part of workplace expectations, employers tick both boxes.\n  Is it an absolute requirement that you encourage your developers to contribute to open source projects? No. But many of your  best developers will chafe at keeping their talents locked up behind the firewall, and other developers simply won&#39;t apply if you have a reputation for being an open source scrooge.\n  LIke who? Like Thomas Caswell, the maintainer of the broadly adopted  Matplotlib, a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In an interview with Caswell, I asked what motivates him. &#34;I love building the tools...for scientists [to use in data science]. That&#39;s the thing that keeps me going. Thinking about the grad student alone in their lab two stories underground at 11:00 PM on a Saturday. Supporting that person is what keeps me going.&#34;\n Your business might not be providing data science tooling to grad students, but you definitely want a Thomas Caswell, or a Bert Hubert, working on your payroll.

"note_en": "Mozilla today launched Firefox 76 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Firefox 76 includes new Firefox Lockwise password functionality, Zoom improvements, and a handful of developer features. You can download Firefox 76 for desktop now from  Firefox.com, and all existing users should be able to upgrade to it automatically. According to Mozilla, Firefox has  about 250 million active users, making it a major platform for web developers to consider.\n The coronavirus is impacting not just everyone spending more time in their browsers as they learn and  work from home, but also the software developers building the browsers. Google was forced to delay  Chrome 81, skip Chrome 82 altogether, and move Chrome 83 up a few weeks. Microsoft followed suit with Edge\u2019s release schedule, consistent with Google\u2019s open source  Chromium project, which both Chrome and Edge are based on. Last month, Mozilla made it clear that while \u201csome of our competitors have had to slow down or stop work,\u201d it is sticking with its  2020 Firefox release schedule.\n  Mozilla this year sped up Firefox releases to a four-week cadence (previously they arrived every six to eight weeks). Even before the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Firefox staff and contributors worked remotely, tested on remote hardware, and collaborated across timezones. While the  schedule remains unchanged, Mozilla did shift its roadmap to avoid shipping changes that might negatively impact the user experience on, or possibly break, government and health services websites. The company also committed to fixing video conferencing issues.\n  Lockwise, the password management service  formerly known as  Firefox Lockbox,\u00a0is getting smarter. The Firefox feature already lets you generate, manage, and protect all those passwords for streaming services, grocery deliveries, and anything else that helps during the pandemic.\n  VB Transform 2020 Online - July 15-17: Join leading AI executives at the AI event of the year.  Register today and save 30% off digital access passes.\n  If you share your device with family or roommates, Lockwise in Firefox 76 can now protect your saved passwords. When you try to view or copy a password from your \u201cLogins and Passwords\u201d page, you will be prompted for your device\u2019s account password.\n  It\u2019s also now easier to check the security of your passwords (click on the hamburger menu button =&gt; Logins and Passwords). If any of your online accounts were involved in a website breach or use a vulnerable password, an icon indicator next to the website address will let you know.\n A Vulnerable Password alert appears when a password is identical to a password that has been breached.\n A Website Breach alert appears when your login and password is involved in a breach and includes more details about the breach.\n Lockwise can also now generate secure passwords (minimum of 12 random letters, numbers, and symbols) for more sites. That means when you\u2019re creating a new account or want to change your password, Lockwise will now ask if you\u2019d like to generate and save a new password.\n  Firefox 76 adds support for Audio Worklets, which run custom JavaScript audio processing code for applications like VR and gaming on the web. Unlike their predecessor,  ScriptProcessorNode, worklets run off the main thread in a similar way to web workers. Mozilla also notes Audio Worklets are \u201cbeing adopted by some of your favorite software programs.\u201d The company specifically called out Zoom, which has become a phenomenon of its own during the pandemic. In short, you now join Zoom calls in Firefox without having to download or install the Zoom client.\n Next up is WebRender, Mozilla\u2019s next-generation GPU-based 2D rendering engine meant to make browsing feel faster and smoother by moving core graphics rendering processes to the GPU. It\u2019s rolling out  to more Firefox for Windows users, specifically on modern Intel laptops with a small screen (&lt;= 1920\u00d71200).\n  There are a few other additions in this release. Here\u2019s the full  Firefox 76 for desktop changelog:\n With today\u2019s release, Firefox strengthens protections for your online account logins and passwords, with innovative approaches to managing your accounts during this critical time. Firefox displays critical alerts in the Lockwise password manager when a website is breached. If one of your accounts is involved in a website breach and you\u2019ve used the same password on other websites, you will now be prompted to update your password. Automatically  generate secure, complex passwords for new accounts across more of the web that are easily saved right in the browser. If you don\u2019t have a master password set up for Firefox, Windows and macOS now requires a login to your operating system account before showing your saved passwords.\n Picture-in-Picture allows you to multitask, the small video window following along no matter what you are doing on your computer, across different applications and even workspaces. Now, when you are ready to focus on the video, a double click can take the small window into full screen. Double click again to reduce the size again.\n Firefox is now supporting Audio Worklets that will allow more complex audio processing, like VR and gaming on the web, and is being adopted by some of your favorite software programs. With this change, you can now join Zoom calls on Firefox saving you the need for additional downloads.\n WebRender continues its roll out to  more Firefox for Windows users, now available by default on modern Intel laptops with a small screen (&lt;= 1920\u00d71200) for improved graphics rendering.\n Two updates to the address bar improve its usability and visibility: The shadow around the address bar field is reduced in width when a new tab is opened, and the bookmarks toolbar has expanded slightly in size to improve its surface area for touchscreens.\n Testing mobile interactions using DevTools\u2019 Responsive Design Mode now mimics the device behavior for handling double-tap to zoom. This builds on previous improvements to correctly rendering meta-viewport tags, allowing developers to optimize their sites for Firefox for Android without a device.\n Double-clicking table headers in DevTools\u2019 network request table now resizes the column width to fit the content, making it easier to expand the important data.\n WebSocket inspection now supports ActionCable message preview, adding to the list of automatically formatted protocols like socket.io, SignalR, WAMP, etc.\n  Audio playback is currently not working when running the 32-bit Windows version of Firefox from a network drive. This will be addressed in an upcoming future Firefox release.\n Developers are also getting some goodies. Firefox 76 brings better JavaScript debugging (ignore entire folders, collapsed output for larger console snippets, copy full URLs in call stack, and always offer Expand All in JSON preview). There are more network inspection tricks (Action Cable support in WebSocket inspection, hide WebSocket Control Frames by default, double click to resize Network table columns to fit, and improved Network response details and copying). The  input input element\u2019s min and max attributes now work correctly when the former\u2019s value is greater than the latter. The  numberingSystem and  calendar options of the  Intl.NumberFormat,  Intl.DateTimeFormat,\u00a0and  Intl.RelativeTimeFormat constructors are now enabled by default. The  IntersectionObserver() constructor now accepts both  Document and  Element objects as its root. If you\u2019re a web developer, check out the details here:  Firefox 76 for developers.\n Mozilla once again did not update Firefox for Android. The Android team is still working on  Firefox Preview, a new version of Firefox for Android powered by GeckoView. Mozilla plans to launch the new Firefox for Android in the first half of 2020 \u2014 it\u2019s got less than two months left.\n Mozilla releases new Firefox versions every four weeks. Firefox 77 is currently slated for June.", "posttime": "2020-05-06 21:15:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5bc6\u7801,firefox,password", "title":

"note_en": "With schools and businesses closed, conferences and conventions canceled, and travel restrictions in effect, very few of us are flying anywhere at the moment. States and countries are already slowly starting to bring themselves back online, though, and eventually, travel with pick up again\u2014at least to some degree.\n But commercial airplanes tend to be essentially airborne sardine cans in which germ-filled passengers are packed horrifyingly close together, all breathing the same recirculated air. For those who  do have to travel, or who are planning to in the rest of 2020, prudence seems advisable. Passengers should wear masks, and airlines can help keep spacing between them by reducing capacity and leaving narrow, overcrowded seats empty for the time being.\n No two airlines are handling the uncertain future in quite the same way. Frontier Airlines, though, is going all in on the industry&#39;s worst nickel-and-diming impulses and is happy to let you gain a few precious inches of space from your neighbor and their bodily fluids\u2014for an additional fee.\n Frontier touts the new charge as the &#34; more room&#34; pledge. &#34;While we believe the best measure to keep everyone healthy is to require face coverings, for those who want an empty seat next to them for extra peace of mind or simply additional comfort, we are now offering &#39;More Room,&#39;&#34; Frontier CEO Barry Biffle said in a written statement.\n The extra fee for a guaranteed empty middle seat will be between $39 and $89, depending on the route. It will be in effect starting this Friday and run at least through the end of August, if not later. Frontier is also requiring face coverings for all passengers in the gate area as well as aboard aircraft, and it will be implementing mandatory hand-washing and health screenings before boarding.\n Every other major US airline is also mandating face coverings for passengers, but so far, none are charging passengers for trying to avoid being breathed on. American has blocked off  half of the middle seats on its flights. Alaska is blocking off  all of them. Delta is not only blocking bookings for middle seats but is also  blocking off seats in other configurations to space passengers out more effectively. JetBlue  limits seats sold and &#34;reviews seat assignments [prior to flight] to ensure as much personal space as possible.&#34; Southwest, which does not assign seats to passengers, has reduced the number of tickets sold per flight so that all middle seats can remain unoccupied after boarding.\n Spirit Airlines, which like Frontier is an ultra-low-cost carrier and is known for charging passengers even for carry-on baggage, says it will leave middle seats vacant &#34;when possible.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-06 21:15:50", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8ddd\u79bb,distancing,\u4e58\u5ba2,passengers", "title": "FronTier\u5c06\u5bf9\u822a\u73ed\u4e0a\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u8ddd\u79bb\u6536\u53d6\u6700\u9ad889\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8d39\u7528", "title_en": "Frontier Will Charge Up To $89 For Social Distancing On Flights", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/05/frontier-will-charge-up-to-89-for-social-distancing-on-flights/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8ddd\u79bb", "\u4e58\u5ba2"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5512d71a8ba5a582bd287fd22d215fc1.jpg", "infoid": 1000921, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636e\u7ea6\u7ff0\u970d\u666e\u91d1\u65af\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u82f1\u56fd\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u82f1\u56fd\u5468\u4e8c\u8d85\u8fc7\u610f\u5927\u5229\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u6b27\u6d32\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4eba\u6570\u6700\u591a\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u3002\n\u63a8\u52a8\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u662f\uff1a\u8be5\u56fd\u4e0a\u4e2a\u6708\u5c06\u5c01\u9501\u5ef6\u957f\u5230\u81f3\u5c115\u6708\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5468\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b\u8d85\u8fc719.6\u4e07\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c\u610f\u5927\u5229\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b\u7ea6\u4e3a21.3\u4e07\u4f8b\u3002\u636e\u82f1\u56fd\u201c\u536b\u62a5\u201d\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u4f26\u6566\u5e1d\u56fd\u7406\u5de5\u5b66\u9662\u672c\u5468\u5728\u82f1\u683c\u5170\u5bf910\u4e07\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4f55\u65f6\u89e3\u9664\u5c01\u9501\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "note_en": "The U.K. surpassed Italy on Tuesday to report the most coronavirus deaths in Europe, according to  Johns Hopkins data and  its own tracker.\n Driving the news: The country, which  prolonged its lockdown last month until at least the second week of May, has reported more than 196,000 cases compared to Italy&#39;s roughly 213,000.

"note_en": "Home |   Internet |  ANALYSIS: The Average Household Will Surpass ISP\u2019s 1TB Data Caps Within 3 Years\n ANALYSIS: The Average Household Will Surpass ISP\u2019s 1TB Data Caps Within 3 Years\n DecisionData.org presents information collected independently from official provider websites. We regularly update the site in an effort to keep this information up-to-date and accurate at all times. The offers that appear on this site are from companies from which DecisionData.org receives compensation.\n Our most recent analysis tracking the growth of home internet usage has found that the average broadband-connected U.S. household will surpass current 1TB ISP data caps before 2024.\n Escalation in data usage in recent months due to stay-at-home orders has caused a spike that might decline in the near future, but home internet usage will remain notably higher than pre-outbreak usage for the foreseeable future.\n ISPs will face pressure from consumers to increase data caps like they did in the late 2010s. It is unclear at this time if any major ISPs will do so.\n When many ISPs increased their data caps from 300GB per month to 1TB per month, it felt like a cap that would never be reached. At the time, the average household had two or three connected devices and would stream Netflix or watch YouTube a few hours a day.\n But four short years after the data caps from most major ISPs increased, some home internet customers are rapidly approaching the new limit. These increases are coming from a wider range of high-bandwidth usage including services like Netflix streaming movies in 4K UHD, YouTube on multiple devices, family video conferencing, more people working from home, and more broadband-intensive web browsing.\n As we reported this month,  the average home internet customer is now using close to 400GB of data a month, a number that would have surpassed the original ISP data caps from 2016 by over 50-100GB. At current fee structures for overages (which vary by provider),  this would add between $200-$250 a year to the average household cable bill.\n Our newest analysis of historical FCC data and trending usage data predicts that within the next three years, or before the year 2024, the average household will use over 1TB of broadband data a month, putting them above the current caps. The mean will likely remain below current cap numbers, but as more households turn into power users, the average will continue to spike.\n  Interestingly, we started conducting research on this trend prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Toward the end of our research and as self-isolation policy started peaking, we are now seeing the largest spikes in home internet usage in history, far beyond what we could have previously predicted or analyzed.  ISPs have properly responded by placing temporary holds on their overage fees for breaching data caps, which reflect that many more consumers have reached or exceeded the 1TB monthly data cap during the pandemic.\n While we believe this spike will mellow as people return to a more normal life in the next 12 months, it will still settle considerably above pre-outbreak levels. As policy gravitates toward more generalized self-isolation and work-from-home, we expect a substantial overall increase of demand on home internet to remain.\n While it is possible that ISPs will respond similarly to previous usage increases by raising the caps again, there will be lag time. Pressure from consumers who see the overage fees will hopefully guide ISPs in the right direction when it comes to setting data usage limits.\n We will continue to follow this trend, especially in light of recent increases in home broadband demand and report on this development.", "posttime": "2020-05-06 21:15:33", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "(Reuters) - Electricity generated by renewable sources like solar, wind and hydro has exceeded coal-fired power in the United States for a record 40 straight days, according to a report based on U.S. government data released on Monday.\n The boost for renewables is due to a seasonal increase in low-cost solar and hydro power generation, alongside an overall slump in electricity demand caused by coronavirus-related stay-at-home orders, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Coal tends to be the first power source to be cut by utilities when demand falls because subsidized renewable sources are cheaper to operate and often backed by state clean-energy mandates.\n The IEEFA report, which is based on preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration going back to late March, reflects how the coronavirus pandemic could accelerate a shift away from coal-fired power, despite Trump administration efforts to prop up the ailing industry.\n The Department of Energy has warned that an over-reliance on solar and wind power can reduce the dependability of the grid because its generation is intermittent, and that fossil fuel plants that can store fuel on site are more reliable.\n Every day between March 25 and May 3, solar, wind and hydro plants together produced more electricity than the nation\u2019s coal-fired plants - accounting for about a fifth of the grid\u2019s power, IEEFA said. The longest back-to-back stretch previously was nine days in 2019. In total in 2019, renewables beat coal on just 38 days, IEEFA said.\n IEEFA added it is possible that renewable energy in the United States could exceed coal on an annual basis for the first time this year, a year earlier than it initially forecast, if the power consumption trends caused by the health crisis continue.\n Overall U.S. electricity consumption is projected to fall 3%this year, largely due to reduced demand from the commercial and industrial sectors, according to the EIA. Residential demand is also expected to fall due to milder winter and summer weather.\n Coal-fired power demand is forecast to take a disproportionate hit, falling 20% this year, EIA has said. Renewable energy generation, meanwhile, will grow 11% because it is dispatched by grid operators whenever it is available because of its low operating cost, EIA forecasts.\n Large amounts of wind and solar capacity are also being added to the grid as governments and businesses seek cleaner power sources, often replacing retiring coal plants.", "posttime": "2020-05-06 21:15:25", "source_domain":

"note_en": "Public trust in the work of scientists and health experts has grown during the coronavirus pandemic, amid a surge in misinformation about the virus, a poll has found.\n The opinion poll by the  Open Knowledge Foundation, an open data campaign group, found 64% of voters were now more likely to listen to expert advice from scientists and researchers, with only 5% saying they were less likely to do so.\n The Survation poll also found 51% of the population had seen fake news about the coronavirus, including discredited claims that Covid-19 was linked to 5G mobile phone masts, on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.\n  Catherine Stihler, the foundation\u2019s chief executive, said the decision to commission the poll had been triggered by a study by Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, which found last month that more than half of Britons had seen misinformation on the virus.\n She said they wanted to see whether public confidence in open data and science had been damaged by that misinformation, but found instead confidence in experts had increased. Survation found 31% were far more likely to listen to experts, and 33% slightly more likely.\n  A majority of voters, 59%, also trusted the government to make the right decisions about using confidential data to decide when to lift the lockdown and change social distancing rules. However, 35% of voters said they did not trust the government, with only 6% unsure.\n The public also wanted much greater access to scientific data, and disliked restrictions on their right to get information. Survation found that 67% of voters believe that all research findings in the search for a Covid-19 vaccine should be made freely available.\n  In addition, 97% of the 1,006 voters polled said government and health bodies should release non-confidential data used by ministers and the NHS to inform their policies, and 95% said that data should always be openly available, on principle.\n Stilher, a former Labour MEP said, said it was essential that ministers and health bodies were transparent during the crisis, given its impact on people\u2019s lives.\n \u201cTrust is really important in all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we want to have trust in what we\u2019re doing, and the action we\u2019re taking, we need to trust the science behind that, and be able to judge it.\u201d\n  The UK government\u2019s decision to use a contact-tracing app with a centralised data-collection process, placing the data on large servers, risked undermining that trust, she said. Other countries, such as Finland, Ireland, Estonia and Switzerland, were using contact tracing apps that used decentralised data that stayed on a user\u2019s phone.\n  \u201cOpenness is critical to trust, and trust is critical to getting us out of this,\u201d she said.\n The foundation asked voters whether they believed governments should use emergency legislation to suspend or change the public\u2019s right to information. The Scottish government has passed controversial powers that allow public bodies up to 60 working days to reply to freedom of information requests.\n Survation found 52% of voters opposed restricting the right to know, while 29% supported it and 18% were unsure.\n The finding that 51% had seen false information about the virus on social media echoes findings from  Ofcom. Its weekly surveys found between 44% and 50% had seen misinformation in the previous week, most often linking coronavirus with 5G masts. Ofcom found that 3% to 7% of people had shared it with other people that week.", "posttime": "2020-05-06 21:08:54", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "That\u2019s the unambiguous message from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which has published  updated guidelines on the rules around online consent to process people\u2019s data.\n Under pan-EU law, consent is one of six lawful bases that data controllers can use when processing people\u2019s personal data.\n  But in order for consent to be legally valid under Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) there are specific standards to meet: It must be clear and informed, specific and freely given.\n Hence cookie walls that demand \u2018consent\u2019 as the price for getting inside the club are not only an oxymoron but run into a legal brick wall.\n  The regional cookie wall has been crumbling for some time, as we  reported last year \u2014 when the Dutch DPA clarified its guidance to ban cookie walls.\n The  updated guidelines from the EDPB look intended to hammer the point home. The steering body\u2019s role is to provide guidance to national data protection agencies to encourage a more consistent application of data protection rules.\n The EDPB\u2019s intervention should \u2014 should! \u2014 remove any inconsistencies of interpretation on the updated points by national agencies of the bloc\u2019s 27 Member States. (Though compliance with EU data protection law tends to be a process; aka it\u2019s a marathon not a sprint, though on the cookie wall issues the \u2018runners\u2019 have been going around the tracks for a considerable time now.)\n As we noted in our report on the Dutch clarification last year, the Internet Advertising Bureau Europe was operating a full cookie wall \u2014 instructing visitors to \u2018agree\u2019 to its data processing terms if they wished to view the content.\n The problem that we pointed out is that that wasn\u2019t a free choice. Yet EU law requires a free choice for consent to be legally valid. So it\u2019s interesting to note the IAB Europe has, at some point since, updated its cookie consent implementation \u2014 removing the cookie wall and offering a fairly clear (if nudged) choice to visitors to either accept or deny cookies for \u201caggregated statistics\u201d\u2026\n  As we said at the time the writing was on the wall for consent cookie walls.\n The EDPB document includes the below example to illustrate the salient point that consent cookie walls do not \u201cconstitute valid consent, as the provision of the service relies on the data subject clicking the \u2018Accept cookies\u2019 button. It is not presented with a genuine choice.\u201d\n    A second area to get attention in the updated guidance, as a result of the EDPB deciding there was a need for additional clarification, is the issue of scrolling and consent.\n Simply put: Scrolling on a website or digital service can not \u2014 in any way \u2014 be interpreted as consent.\n Or, as the EDPB puts it, \u201cactions such as scrolling or swiping through a webpage or similar user activity will not  under any circumstances satisfy the requirement of a clear and affirmative action\u201d [emphasis ours].\n Logical reason being such signals are not unambiguous. (Additionally, the EDPB example raises the point of how would a user withdraw consent if such a signal were valid? By scrolling back up the same web page? Obviously that would be ridiculous and confusing.)\n The gem in the updated guidelines on  #GDPR consent saying when action on a website may or may not constitute valid consent. Random user activity is not consent, for many reasons. Best reason: how to withdraw consent with equally random user activity? ;-)  https://t.co/lRmtFySA8Q  pic.twitter.com/XktzldSUH0\n    So any websites still trying to drop tracking cookies the moment a site visitor scrolls the page are risking regulatory enforcement. (Reminder: GDPR fines can scale as high as \u20ac20M or 4% of global annual turnover.)\n Nonetheless,  recent research suggests cookie consent theatre remains rife in the EU \u2014 albeit, not only limited to the \u2018scroll and you\u2019ve been tracked\u2019 flavor of the practice.\n Manipulative consent pop-ups and dark patterns also remain a major problem, with such tactics being actively deployed to undermine legal protections for EU citizens\u2019 data.\n Still, a lot of clarifying light has now been shone into this area by both regulators and courts, shrinking the operating space for bad faith actors.\n A ruling by the  European Court of Justice    last year made it clear that active consent is required for tracking cookies, for example \u2014 also demolished \u2018pre-checking\u2019 as a valid way of gathering consent, among other stipulations.\n Plus there\u2019s  increasing pressure on regulators to actually  enforce the rules \u2014 with GDPR\u2019s two year anniversary fast approaching.\n So where consent is concerned, the rule of thumb, if you need one, is you can\u2019t steal consent nor conceal consent. And if you wish to shortcut consent you can only do so if your shortcut is A) clearly and accurately signposted and B) you offer a similarly easy route to opt-out again.

"note_en": "Once a startup has gained some traction and founders lack the bandwidth or skill set to ship a product quickly, a founding engineer can join to help. Such an engineer has a unique combination of skills to operate in ambiguity, take risks, and get stuff done under tight timelines. Although, recruiting a founding engineer is challenging since  87% of engineers\u00a0are already employed (pre-COVID-19 stat), and those who are a good fit prefer to become entrepreneurs themselves.\n We hired a founding engineer within two months of starting our company \u2014 without external funding, a launched product, or an established brand. I wanted to share our process across the three phases of hiring \u2014 Sourcing, Interviewing, and Closing. Existing entrepreneurs, less than two years into their journey, will find these learnings valuable when trying to hire their first engineer.\n   The goal for this phase is to search for potential candidates and connect with them.\n  Create a set of necessary skills by thinking about your technical stack, collaboration needs, and culture of the company. Concreteness in this exercise will lead to efficiency in searching for candidates.\n    When making a technology choice, consider its impact on attracting talent. In our case,  Golang proved to be an exciting choice for candidates.\n Early-stage startups can\u2019t afford the ramp-up cost for learning to work remotely; make sure the candidate has experience working in a remote setup.\n  Job postings with a\u00a0 detailed description of the technical challenges\u00a0 and\u00a0 opportunities to learn\u00a0will lead to a higher quality of applicants.\u00a0Filter out cookie-cut applications instead, prioritize researched and specific ones.  Angelist\u00a0and\u00a0 LinkedIn\u00a0were our primary job boards.\n     Recommended matches\u00a0feature for your LinkedIn Job post is a valuable tool to review potential candidates for free.\n    Cold outreach worked for us after we narrowed down our search criteria and found a platform to apply those filters.\n   Github was the most effective  free platform in searching for candidates with the above criteria. Search capability in Github helped us find a targeted set of candidates. For example, this\u00a0 search query\u00a0finds Golang developers based in India with more than 50 followers, along with their contact emails.\n   Angelist provides basic filters for  free with advanced filters for a $199/mo subscription. In contrast, LinkedIn only opens up filters, and unlimited searches with a\u00a0 Sales Navigator account\u00a0for $79.99/mo.\n  Github is one of the best places to locate founding engineers and learn about their prior projects\n Experiment with your search criteria until you find a relevant pool of candidates. We received high engagement from candidates who participated in  Google Summer of code; this became one of our key search criteria\n  Sending identical reach-out messages doesn\u2019t work. Plan to spend about 15-30 minutes on personalizing each reach-out message by understanding a candidate\u2019s past projects, public talks, and prior work experience. Sending out personalized messages will sharpen your ability to sell, a critical skill in your startup journey. We received the highest response rate with the following message structure:\n  Vary the technique for sending these messages based on the platform \u2014 Email, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Emails should be descriptive but concise; Direct Messages via Twitter should be conversational; LinkedIn connection request messages should be short and attractive.\n               After receiving a list of potential candidates from the sourcing phase, we conducted a four-step interview process for each candidate.\n  A successful outcome of this call is to gauge the candidate\u2019s appetite to work at a startup, passion for the problem space, and hands-on technical expertise. Specific problems being solved by us were most interesting to candidates.\n     Present a deck during this call to increase engagement with the candidate. We used\u00a0 this\u00a0slide deck.\n  Include a take-home exercise in your process for evaluating a candidate\u2019s technical skillset. A high-signal exercise should take 1-2 days to complete, be specific to your domain, and ambiguous enough to provide space for creativity. Our exercise enabled us to gather the following signals: problem-solving skills, quality of code, and the ability to implement a working solution in a short time.\n     Choose a technical problem from your startup as an exercise; this can gauge a candidate\u2019s passion for the domain.\n  Evaluating a candidate\u2019s capability to design and manage complex technical systems is the motivation of this round \u2014 this a fairly standard interview with a ton of material online. Instead of generic questions, we spent time brainstorming about converting the take-home exercise into a production-ready service, along with monitoring, testability, and optimizations to the core search algorithm.\n    Early stages of a startup are a roller coaster ride \u2014 mostly filled with downs. You want a founding engineer who would draw positivity from experience and develop the company culture along with the founders. We spent time screening for the following skills: make progress in ambiguity, appetite to take risks, decision-making process, and the ability to receive constructive feedback.\n  Explain a specific scenario that involved conflict or disagreement with a teammate. How did you resolve it?\n  Describe one of your failed projects? What were the learnings, and what could have been different to change its outcome?\n    At this point, you have found a candidate who is an excellent fit for the role, but plan to spend a significant amount of time to close the candidate. Focus your sales pitch on:\n   The percentage of equity should be comparable to the yearly salary divided by the valuation of the company.\n  To summarize, we hired a rockstar founding engineer by performing a highly targeted search on Github, sending personalized reach outs, building a challenging take-home exercise, and providing fair equity.", "posttime": "2020-05-06 20:51:15",

"note_en": "Soon the Windows May 2020 Update (20H1) will be released upon the world. This update will contain some nice UI improvements, but most relevant to me it allows Web Developers on Windows to  upgrade to WSL 2. This is a significant milestone in the  #davegoeswindows saga and it\u2019s worth posting about what it means going forward.\n I\u2019ve been running WSL 2 on my 13\u201d Surface Laptop 2 for nearly a year now and the initial results are jaw dropping:\n Got  #WSL2 running on my laptop. Compiling my blog with `bundle exec jekyll build`...  WSL1: 7.853 seconds WSL2: 0.567 seconds  \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\n\u2014 Dave Rupert (@davatron5000)  June 18, 2019\n  That\u2019s 13x faster! It\u2019s not every day you get a 13x productivity boost for free. I got chills and a bit misty-eyed when I saw the results myself for the first time. Why was I weeping? Well, I was mostly mourning all the lost time I\u2019ve accrued over the last ~5 years.\n It\u2019s not just blog compilations either. This improves  npm installs, webpacking, file-watching, hot module reloading, server startups; nearly everything you do on a daily basis as a Web Developer is dramatically faster. It\u2019s like owning a Mac again (or possibly better since Apple has been thermal throttling their CPUs in favor of battery life for the last few years).\n  How could it possibly be a 13x delta? I wrote about it some before when  I considered switching back to Mac, but the  tl;dr is that disk writes and Linux  stat calls were expensive operations to make due to the WSL 1 architecture. And guess what modern web development heavily relies on? Yup. When you compile the whole gotdanged planet on every file save, you do a lot of disk writes and  stat calls on tens of thousands of files.\n Once you learn about this bottleneck, it\u2019s hard to un-see. Depressing psychology takes over when you hear something\u2019s slow and then finally experience it for yourself. Your world caves in a bit and the tool you like doesn\u2019t seem practical anymore.\n Thankfully, the WSL team made a big bet and overhauled the whole WSL system. Those pain points were solved in WSL 2 by embedding a whole first-party Linux VM inside Windows and moving the file operations over to a VHD (Virtual Hardware Disk) network drive. The tradeoff is that you pay a first-time startup hit to spin up the VM, which is in the order of milliseconds and hardly noticeable to me, e.g. nothing like spinning up a docker, it\u2019s actually fast.\n  To get the full benefit of WSL 2, you\u2019ll also want to move your project files from  /mnt/c/Users/&lt;username&gt;/ over to your new  ~/ Linux home directory on your new VHD. You can see the contents of this drive on the Network by going to  \\\\wsl$\\&lt;distro name&gt;\\&lt;username&gt;\\home or typing the command  explorer.exe . from your bash prompt.\n This is your Linux filesystem and it acts and behaves as you\u2019d expect. I made a folder called  ~/projects that has all my project repos and then I open those projects in VS Code using the  code . command.\n  Installing the  Remote Development Extension for VS Code is the final step in having a smooth developer experience. The Remote extension acts as a bridge for WSL and forces VS Code to do all its operations ( git, command line, extension installations, etc) straight into your Linux distro. It makes it all very self-contained.\n At first I was a little upset by this extension, because it kept nagging me to re-install stuff I already had installed. But now I appreciate it because it adds a layer of visualization as to which environment I\u2019m running and where files exist. It takes some of the mystery out of the Windows web development process and using the version control UI in Code is a lot smoother.\n  The excitement to install the next Windows Update and to get a proper, functioning, fast Linux environment up and running on my beefy gaming computer is palpable. There\u2019s probably some problems lurking that I don\u2019t know about yet, but following the development on the Insider Preview I know the WSL team has solved most of the initial gotchas.\n And  Windows Terminal is good now too! It solves  all my previous gripes about lack of tabs, JSON configurability, and the ephemeral problem of \u201cfeeling cool\u201d on Windows. It\u2019s still weird to say it, but Windows Terminal is hands-down the best terminal on Windows.\n Having been developing on Windows for 5 years, I\u2019ve been through a lot. From not being able to install Rails, struggling with faux-bash Cygwin shells, and then sitting  in the front row at Build 2016 when they announced the first version of WSL; that\u2019s when there was a glimmer of hope that Web Development on Windows would be viable. Without a doubt, WSL 2 is the biggest improvement I\u2019ve seen since then and it feels like a new era for Web Development on Windows.", "posttime": "2020-05-06 20:36:28", "source_domain":

It\u2019s low tide, and the sand is wet and hard-packed and stony. This early on a Sunday, there are often only two people here, on the California coast just north of San Diego. Patricia Churchland is throwing a rubber ball into the ocean for her two dogs (Fergus and Maxwell, golden retrievers) to fetch. Her husband, Paul Churchland, is standing next to her. They are both wearing heavy sweaters. They are in their early sixties. They are tall\u2014she is five feet eight, he is six feet five. They come here every Sunday at dawn.\n  Pat is constantly in motion, throwing the ball, stepping backward, rubbing her hands together, walking forward in a vigorous, twitchy way. She has pale eyes, a sharp chin, and the crisp, alert look of someone who likes being outside in the cold. (Even when it is sunny, she looks as though she were enjoying a bracing wind.) She seems younger than she is: she has the anxious vitality of a person driven to prove herself\u2014the first to jump off a bridge into freezing water. Paul stands heavily, his hands in his pockets. He is still. He nudges at a stone with his foot. He looks up and smiles at his wife\u2019s back. He has a thick beard. He looks like the sort of person who finds it soothing to chop his own wood (and in fact he is that sort of person).\n Paul and Pat met when she was nineteen and he was twenty, and they have been married for almost forty years. They are both Canadian; she grew up on a farm in the Okanagan Valley, he, in Vancouver. They have two children and four grandchildren. They live in Solana Beach, in a nineteen-sixties house with a small pool and a hot tub and an herb garden. Each summer, they migrate north to a tiny island off the Vancouver coast. Both are professors of philosophy at the University of California at San Diego. They have been talking about philosophy together since they met, which is to say more or less since either of them encountered the subject. They test ideas on each other; they criticize each other\u2019s work. At this point, they have shaped each other so profoundly and their ideas are so intertwined that it is impossible, even for them, to say where one ends and the other begins. Their work is so similar that they are sometimes discussed, in journals and books, as one person. Some of their theories are quite radical, and at the start of their careers the Churchlands were not always taken seriously: sometimes their ideas were thought silly, sometimes repugnant, verging on immoral. In those days, they formed a habit of thinking of themselves as isolates aligned against a hostile world, and although they are now both well established in their field, the habit lingers.\n  \u201cFor the first twenty-five years of our career, Pat and I wrote only one paper together,\u201d Paul says, \u201cpartly because we wanted to avoid\u2014\u201d\n   \u201cTogether? I thought \u2018Stalking the Wild Epistemic Engine\u2019 was the first.\u201d\n  \u201cO.K., so there\u2019s two. In the early stages, when Pat wrote her papers she said, \u2018Paul, you really had a lot of input into this, should we put your name on it?\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want people saying Pat\u2019s sailing on Paul\u2019s coattails.\u2019 \u201d\n The guiding obsession of their professional lives is an ancient philosophical puzzle, the mind-body problem: the problem of how to understand the relationship between conscious experience and the brain. Are they different stuffs: the mind a kind of spirit, the brain, flesh? Or are they the same stuff, their seeming difference just a peculiarly intractable illusion? And if they are the same stuff, if the mind is the brain, how can we comprehend that fact? What can it possibly mean to say that my experience of seeing blue is  the same thing as a clump of tissue and membrane and salty liquid?\n Think of some evanescent emotion\u2014apprehension mixed with conceit, say. Then think, That feeling and that mass of wet tissue\u2014 same thing. Or think of the way a door shutting sounds to you, which is private, inaccessible to anyone else, and couldn\u2019t exist without you conscious and listening; that and the firing of cells in your brain, which any neuroscientist can readily detect without your co\u00f6peration\u2014 same thing. The terms don\u2019t match, they don\u2019t make sense together, any more than it makes sense to ask how many words you can fit in a truck. That is the problem.\n In the past, it seemed obvious that mind and matter were not the same stuff; the only question was whether they were connected. Everyone was a dualist. In the seventeenth century, Leibniz thought that mind and body only appeared to interact because God had established a perfectly synchronized harmony between them (an ingenious theory impossible to refute). Descartes believed that the mind was composed of a strange substance that was not physical but that interacted with the material of the brain by means of the pineal gland. Nowadays, few people doubt that the mind somehow is the brain, but although that might seem like the end of the matter, all that\u2019s necessary to be clear on the subject, it is not. It is not enough to imagine that the brain  houses the mind (in some obscure cavity, perhaps tiny intracellular pockets), or  gives rise to the mind (the way a television produces an image), or  generates the mind (a generator producing current): to imagine any of those things is to retain the idea that the mind and the brain are distinct from each other. The problem is not one of knowledge; the problem is our obdurate, antediluvian minds that cannot grasp what we believe to be true.\n  Some philosophers think that we will never solve this problem\u2014that our two thousand years of trying and failing indicate that it\u2019s likely we are no more capable of doing so than a goat can do algebra. Others believe that someday a conceptual revolution will take place, on a par with those of Copernicus and Darwin, and then all at once it will be clear how matter and mind, brain and consciousness, are one thing. Paul and Pat Churchland believe that the mind-body problem will be solved not by philosophers but by neuroscientists, and that our present knowledge is so paltry that we would not understand the solution even if it were suddenly to present itself. \u201cSuppose you\u2019re a medieval physicist wondering about the burning of wood,\u201d Pat likes to say in her classes. \u201cYou\u2019re Albertus Magnus, let\u2019s say. One night, a Martian comes down and whispers, \u2018Hey, Albertus, the burning of wood is really rapid oxidation!\u2019 What could he do? He knows no structural chemistry, he doesn\u2019t know what oxygen is, he doesn\u2019t know what an element is\u2014he couldn\u2019t make any sense of it. And if some fine night that same omniscient Martian came down and said, \u2018Hey, Pat, consciousness is really blesjeakahgjfdl!\u2019 I would be similarly confused, because neuroscience is just not far enough along.\u201d Philosophers have always thought about what it means to be made of flesh, but the introduction into the discipline of a wet, messy, complex, and redundant collection of neuronal connections is relatively new. Nowadays, it seems obvious to many philosophers that if they are interested in the mind they should pay attention to neuroscience, but this was not at all obvious when Pat and Paul were starting out, and that it is so now is in some measure due to them.\n The Churchlands like to try, as far as possible, not only to believe that they themselves are thoroughly physical creatures but also to  feel it\u2014to experience their thoughts as bodily sensations. They have never thought it a diminishment of humanness to think of their consciousness as flesh\u2014quite the opposite. And they are monists in life as they are in philosophy: they wonder what sort of organism their marriage is, its body and its mental life, beginning when they were unformed and very young\u2014all those years of sharing the same ideas and the same dinners. When they met, Paul and Pat were quite different, from each other and from what they are now: he knew about astronomy and electromagnetic theory, she about biology and novels. But as time went on they taught each other what they knew, and the things they didn\u2019t share fell away. Their family unity was such that their two children\u2014now in their thirties\u2014grew up, professionally speaking, almost identical: both obtained Ph.D.s in neuroscience and now study monkeys. Paul sometimes thinks of Pat and himself as two hemispheres of the same brain\u2014differentiated in certain functions but bound together by tissue and neuronal pathways worn in unique directions by shared incidents and habit. This is not a fantasy of transparency between them: even one\u2019s own mind is not transparent to oneself, Paul believes, so to imagine his wife\u2019s brain joined to his is merely to exaggerate what is actually the case\u2014two organisms evolving into one in a shared shell.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s funny the way your life is your life and you don\u2019t know any other life,\u201d Pat says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it would have been like if I\u2019d been married to\u2014\u201d\n   \u201cI think the two of us have been, jointly, several orders of magnitude more successful than at least I would have been on my own,\u201d Paul says. \u201cI\u2019d like to understand that better than I do; I presume it\u2019s got something to do with the brain. You could say, well, we exchanged a lot of oxytocin, but that\u2019s probably one per cent of the story.\u201d (Oxytocin is a peptide produced in the body during orgasm and breast-feeding; when it is sprayed into the noses of experimental subjects, they become more trusting and co\u00f6perative.) \u201cTo what extent has Pat shaped my conceptual framework and hence my perceptions of the world, and to what extent have I done that for her? I think the answer is, an enormous extent. But I don\u2019t know how to unwind it.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ve been married thirty-six years, and I guess we\u2019ve known each other for forty-two or something like that. That\u2019s a long time.\u201d\n   The tide is coming in. A few more people have arrived at the beach\u2014there are now a couple of cars parked next to the Churchlands\u2019 white Toyota Sequoia. Pat and Paul walk up toward the road. The dogs come running out of the sea, wet and barking.\n  Pat Churchland grew up in rural British Columbia. Her parents owned an orchard\u2014in the summer the Okanagan Valley is hot enough for peaches. \u201cWe used to regale people with stories of life on the farm because they thought it was from the nineteenth century,\u201d Pat says.\n  \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an indoor toilet until I was seven. We had a two-holer, and people actually did sit in the loo together. I know it seems  hilarious now.\u201d\n When Pat was a teen-ager, she worked in a fruit-packing plant. Neither of her parents was formally educated past the sixth grade. In her understanding of herself, this kind of childhood is very important. To her, growing up on a farm in the middle of nowhere means that you have no patience for verbiage, you are interested only in whether a thing works or not. And if it doesn\u2019t work you had better figure out how to fix it yourself, because no one is going to do it for you.\n When Pat went to college, she decided that she wanted to learn about the mind: what is intelligence, what it is to reason, what it is to have emotions. She found that these questions were not being addressed in the first place she looked, psychology\u2014many psychologists then were behaviorists\u2014but they were discussed somewhat in philosophy, so she started taking philosophy courses. She met Paul in a Plato class, her sophomore year. She soon discovered that the sort of philosophy she was being taught was not what she was looking for. At the time, in the nineteen-sixties, Anglo-American philosophy was preoccupied with language\u2014many philosophers felt that their task was to untangle the confusions and incoherence in the way people spoke, in the belief that disagreements were often misunderstandings, and that if our concepts were better sorted out then our thinking would also be clearer. This held no great appeal for Pat, but one thing led to another, and she found herself in philosophy graduate school at the University of Pittsburgh. The department was strong in philosophy of science, and to her relief Pat found people there who agreed that ordinary language philosophy was a bit sterile. At Pittsburgh, she read W. V. O. Quine\u2019s book \u201cWord and Object,\u201d which had been published a few years earlier, and she learned, to her delight, that it was possible to question the distinction between empirical and conceptual truth: not only could philosophy concern itself with science; it could even be a kind of science.\n  After a year, she moved to Oxford to do a B.Phil. Philosophy at Oxford at the time was very far from Pittsburgh\u2014quite conservative, not at all empirically oriented. Nobody seemed to be interested in what she was interested in, and when she tried to do what she was supposed to she was bad at it. It was all very discouraging. She was beginning to feel that philosophy was just a lot of blather. \u201cThe idea seemed to be that, if you analyzed your concepts, somehow that led you to the truth of the nature of things,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just garbage.\u201d She was about to move back to Canada and do something else entirely, maybe go into business, but meanwhile Paul Churchland had broken up with the girlfriend he\u2019d had when they were undergraduates and had determined to pursue her. He came over to Oxford for the summer, and they rented a little house together on Iffley Road. Paul had started thinking about how you might use philosophy of science to think about the mind, and he wooed Pat with his theories.\n  At Pittsburgh, where he had also gone for graduate school, he had learned to be suspicious of the intuitively plausible idea that you could see the world directly and form theories about it afterward\u2014that you could rely on your basic perceptions (seeing, hearing, touching) being as straightforwardly physical and free from bias as they appeared to be. He concluded that we cannot help perceiving the world through the medium of our ideas about it. It\u2019s not just a matter of what we pay attention to\u2014a farmer\u2019s interest might be aroused by different things in a landscape than a poet\u2019s\u2014but of what we actually  see. In the course of that summer, Pat came to look at philosophy quite differently. \u201cI stayed in the field because of Paul,\u201d she says. \u201cGradually, I could see all kinds of things to do, and I could see what counted as progress.\u201d Philosophy could actually change your experience of the world, she realized. And if it could change your experience of the world then it had the potential to do important work, as important as that of science, because coming to see something in a wholly different way was like discovering a new thing.\n Paul didn\u2019t grow up on a farm, but he was raised in a family with a practical bent: his father started a boat-works company in Vancouver, then taught science in a local high school. His mother took in sewing.\n  \u201cI guess I have long known that there was only the brain,\u201d Pat says.\n   \u201cI remember deciding at about age eleven or twelve, after a discussion with my friends about the universe and did God exist and was there a soul and so forth,\u201d Paul says. \u201cI\u2019d been skeptical about God. My parents weren\u2019t religious. I would ask myself, What do you think thinking is? And I\u2019d say, I guess it\u2019s just electricity.\u201d\n Paul as a boy was obsessed with science fiction, particularly books by Robert Heinlein. He vividly remembers \u201cOrphans of the Sky,\u201d the story of a young man named Hugh Hoyland. Hugh lives in a world called the Ship, which is run by scientists\u2014all except for the upper decks, where it is dangerous to venture because of the mutants, or \u201cmuties,\u201d who live there. One day, Hugh is captured by an intelligent two-headed mutie named Joe-Jim, who takes him up to the control room of the Ship and shows him the sky and the stars. All at once, Hugh realizes that what he had been told were inscrutable religious metaphors were in fact true: the Ship is not the whole universe after all but merely a thing inside it, and it is actually making some sort of journey. He tries to explain this to the scientists, but they tell him he is talking nonsense. How could the Ship move when the Ship is all there is? \u201cOrphans of the Sky\u201d is a classic philosophical fable, a variant of Plato\u2019s story about prisoners in a cave who mistake shadows cast on the wall for reality. Its moral is not very useful for day-to-day work, in philosophy or anything else\u2014what are you supposed to do with it?\u2014but it has retained a hold on Paul\u2019s imagination: he always remembers that, however certain he may be about something, however airtight an argument appears or however fundamental an intuition, there is always a chance that both are completely wrong, and that reality lies in some other place that he hasn\u2019t looked because he doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s there.\n Paul\u2019s father had a woodworking and metal shop in the basement, and Paul was always building things. He planned eventually to build flying saucers, and decided that he was going to be an aerodynamical engineer. He stuck with this plan when he got to college, taking courses in math and physics. But the summer after his first year he found himself hanging around with a group of friends who could make sophisticated arguments about the existence of God. Paul was at a disadvantage not knowing what the ontological argument was, and he determined to take some philosophy classes when he went back to school. Although he was trained, as Pat was, in ordinary language philosophy, by the time he graduated he also was beginning to feel that that sort of philosophy was not for him. When he got to Pittsburgh, Wilfrid Sellars became his dissertation adviser. In the mid-nineteen-fifties, a few years before Paul became his student, Sellars had proposed that the sort of basic psychological understanding that we take for granted as virtually instinctive\u2014if someone is hungry, he will try to find something to eat; if he believes a situation to be dangerous, he will try to get away\u2014was not. Concepts like \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201cdesires\u201d do not come to us naturally; they have to be learned. Nor were they simply descriptive: we do not see beliefs, after all\u2014we conjecture that they are there based on how a person is behaving. No, this kind of ordinary psychological understanding was something like a theory, a more or less coherent collection of assumptions and hypotheses, built up over time, that we used to explain and predict other people\u2019s behavior.\n In writing his dissertation, Paul started with Sellars\u2019s idea that ordinary or \u201cfolk\u201d psychology was a theory and took it a step further. If folk psychology was a theory, Paul reasoned, it could turn out to be wrong. It had happened many times, after all, that understandings that felt as fundamental and unshakable as instincts turned out to be wrong. Our folk geology\u2014the evidence of our eyes and common sense\u2014told us that the earth was flat, and while it still might look that way we accepted that it was an illusion. Our folk biology told us that if we slammed a hand in a door we would feel pain at the point of contact\u2014and, while we still felt pain in the hand, we now knew that the pain signal had to travel away from the hand to the brain before we experienced it. Folk psychology, too, had suffered corrections; it was now widely agreed, for instance, that we might have repressed motives and memories that we did not, for the moment, perceive. Surely it was likely that, with progress in neuroscience, many more counterintuitive results would come to light. How probable was it, after all, that, in probing the brain, scientists would come across little clusters of \u201cbelief\u201d neurons? It wasn\u2019t that beliefs didn\u2019t exist; it was just that it seemed highly improbable that the first speakers of the English language, many hundreds of years ago, should miraculously have chanced upon the categories that, as the saying goes, carved nature at its joints. It might turn out, for instance, that it would make more sense, brain-wise, to grou\n......", "posttime": "2020-05-06 20:21:43", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

"note_en": "In a state of intimidation when attempting to make my first TEA laser, I had a sheet metal shop cut some pieces of .062 aluminum to use as the base and capacitor plates. I did get these pieces to work but I soon tried using ordinary aluminum foil, as I had seen others use, and found that it worked as well or better than the thicker pieces of aluminum sheet metal. The thin flexible aluminum foil has a surprising tendency to cling to the dielectric because of the electrical HV electrostatic attraction. This tends to make the capacitor have very low inductance which is necessary for a TEA laser to work.  The capacitor plates can be almost any width or length. A good rule of thumb is to make the foil capacitor plates approx 3 inches wide and about the same length as the electrodes. I have tried many different sizes of foil plates and they all work. The only critical thing is to make the two capacitor plate edges straight and have about 1/8 inch spacing between them. While experimenting with the &#34;Double L&#34; electrode configuration, I used 1 inch wide angle aluminum. These electrodes each had a one inch flat bottom that would sit intimately against the surface. I was able to get very observable laser action while these electrodes were just sitting on the dielectric, without any top foil plates at all. There was more laser output of course when I did use capacitor plates below these electrodes. In all of my experiments so far, I have always used top foil plates of the same size. This always works well but at the professor&#39;s web site (see links), he talks about getting good laser action with one top plate being smaller than the other. In this case it does matter what side the spark gap is on. The only question about dielectric materials is not if they will work but merely how long they will work before breaking down under the HV stress and shorting the capacitor. Every dielectric material that I tried worked well. One of the best of common materials seems to be Mylar (trade name for Polyester). I have been using a piece of 8 1/2 X 11 inch material 4mil thick (from a photocopy shop) used to make overhead transparencies. I don&#39;t know if it is mylar, acetate or what but it has been holding up for a long time, works very well and is an excellent choice. At this time, this 4 mil transparency material has never yet failed under a lot of operation using 5.5 KV.  Polypropylene or flexible vinyl sheets usually last just a few minutes. The charging and discharging of the capacitors puts a lot of stress on the dielectric.  The thickness of the dielectric is a critical parameter. For TEA lasers to work, the capacitors must have a very low self inductance so that the discharge across the electrodes can happen in an extremely short time (several nanoseconds). A capacitor made with a thin dielectric has less self inductance than a capacitor made from a thicker dielectric. Thus if the dielectric is too thick, there is no laser action. The 4 mil dielectric material that I have been using most of the time works great. I also used a piece of 8 mil mylar and it worked well with perhaps a bit less output. The optimum dielectric would be to use as thin as can be used without breaking down. The professor&#39;s web site says that 2,5 mil mylar is very good. As soon as I can get a hold of some 2.5 mil Mylar I will be anxious to try it. At the professors web site he points out that capacitors made from normal .062 thick printed circuit material can not be made to work as a laser because it&#39;s thickness causes too much inductance in the capacitor. He points out that a thinner but harder to obtain pc material works ok. There is no need though, to worry about using pc material to make capacitors for a laser. Pc material is expensive and a pain to work with if you are etching it. The foil and plastic capacitors work very well. A good material for the base and to build the capacitors on, is to use a good flat piece of 3/4&#34; particle board. How critical is the construction of the laser electrode rails with regard to straightness, shape, length etc.?\n The laser electrodes, where the actual laser action takes place between them, are usually a couple of long pieces of straight aluminum with thin edges that face each other approx 1mm apart. The adjustment of this spacing is critical but easily done.  The idea of making electrodes parallel enough to discharge along their entire length is intimidating especially if you have ever tried to do this along a very long spark gap. Under normal conditions it is perhaps impossible to get a spark jumping across a long narrow pair of electrodes, to cover their entire length. You will always get a tiny bright spark at one place at a time. This was one of the reasons the TEA laser before building one, seemed intimidating.  As it turns out in the case of TEA lasers, the extremely fast voltage transition between the electrodes creates a discharge across their entire length. Adjustment for this condition is relatively easy. There are many materials and methods that work well for making TEA laser electrode rails. I have seen and tried everything from aluminum welding rod to angle aluminum and they all seem to work. My favorite right now is the use of angle aluminum. Angle aluminum tends to be very straight and it resists the tendency to flex during adjustment. It is also a very common material that can be purchased at almost any hardware store.  Try to avoid using anodized aluminum. I was able to make it work but I had to remove the anodized finish on the facing discharge edges and wherever contact was to be made against the aluminum foil plates. TRUST ME!! ANODIZED FINISH IS EXTREMELY HARD AND REMOVING IT IS NO PICNICK!! You can tell if aluminum is anodized by using an ohmmeter. Just touch both test probes to the aluminum. If it is anodized, the meter will indicate open circuit. If it is not anodized, the meter will indicate zero resistance. Anodized aluminum also tends to have more of a frosty white appearance.  1/8&#34; diameter aluminum rod works well but tends to flex during adjustment especially when there is three of more weights holding it down against the foil. Most of the lasers that I made from rod also had the tendency to put out a broader beam (bigger spot on a fluorescent piece of paper). The pieces of aluminum should be thin at the point where they oppose each other. I found that angle aluminum .047&#34; thick works very well. 1/16&#34; (.063&#34;) thick aluminum works almost as well but I could not get the flat edge of 1/8 aluminum to work at all (unless using the inverted V configuration described below). The edge creating the discharge also needs to be raised slightly (typically about 1/16&#34;) so that it is not touching the dielectric below. For some reason, lasers work much better this way. I was able to get two electrodes (two pieces of angle aluminum) that were sitting right down against the dielectric to work but adjustment was much more difficult and there was less output. I have been getting excellent results using pieces of 1&#34; angle aluminum .047&#34; thick and 10 inches long. I also get excellent laser action when just one of the two opposing electrodes has a thin edge. One of the opposing electrode rails can be a flat surface. This configuration is shown in the photos. The angle aluminum on the flat side is simply set flat on the foil. This is perhaps my favorite configuration because it is so easy to test many different electrode shapes and materials against the flat electrode. TEA lasers made this way work very well. I call this the &#34;Against The Wall&#34; electrode rail configuration.  One of my favorite ways of making the thin electrode rail (opposite the flat wall) is to put a piece of 18 ga copper wire near the bottom edge of a .047&#34; thick piece of angle aluminum (see photos). This wire keeps the edge up away from the dielectric while making contact with the foil very near the discharge edge. I tend to get good bright output from a laser built this way and the spot seems to be as good and tight as any of the methods I have tried. Another excellent &#34;against the wall&#34; electrode rail can be made with a piece of 1/8&#34; thick angle aluminum. As I mentioned a while ago, I could get very little if no laser action using a 1/8&#34; thick electrode edge. However, if the angle aluminum is put in an inverted V position (see photos and drawings), you get a very good sharp corner that faces the opposite &#34;wall&#34;. This also makes an excellent laser. The inverted V rail is more difficult to set a weight on top but whenever I have used this method, the 1/8&#34; thick piece of angle aluminum was heavy enough by it self to work well. Two pieces of 1/8&#34; angle aluminum can also be used in a double upside down V configuration as shown in the drawing. This also works very well. The two pieces being the same height, in this configuration, makes it easy to put a weight on top of both of them using an insulator.  The electrode rails can be almost any length. I found it easy to make lasers work well at any electrode length between 10 and 3 inches. The longer electrodes tend to give a brighter output and a narrower beam. I have not yet tried making electrodes longer than 10 inches simply because I don&#39;t have any dielectric pieces longer than 11 inches. I hope to try making some 24 inch long electrode rails soon if I can get some dielectric material of appropriate length. I have put a video on youtube that shows one of my 3&#34; long TEA lasers working. See my links section. In the video, I can pick it up and aim it at different targets. I see the possibility of a maximum electrode length beyond which there would be no further gain in laser output because of speed of light or current flow limitations or something similar but, I can not say as I am not a laser expert.  It seems that narrower is better. I believe electrode rails that are sitting on the aluminum should not be wider than about one inch. Contact with the aluminum foil should be made all along the electrode length and as close to the electrode edge as possible in order to minimize inductance.  What about bright sparks that jump between the electrodes in addition to the blue glow?\n With these TEA lasers. The hot spots are common and almost unavoidable. I have managed on a couple of occasions to have a laser work with just the blue glow having no hot sparks at all. I think it may have had something to do in part with the top foil plates being shorter than the electrodes and not being too wide. From all of my humble observations, I have not observed any detrimental effect caused by these hot sparks when compared to not having hot sparks. Lasers that have had hot sparks and the few that I made that had no hot sparks, seem to work the same. I am speculating with my limited knowledge of laser physics, that the laser action occurs first and is finished before the hot sparks occur. From my experience, I would say that amateurs building TEA lasers need not worry much about the hot sparks across the electrodes.  Almost every T.E.A. laser that I have made works reasonably well when the space between the laser electrodes is adjusted to a width of 1mm. I found a paper clip that was made of exactly 1mm diameter wire. A handy electrode spacing tool was made by bending this paper clip straight and filing any burr off of its end. The laser electrode spacing is adjusted by putting the end of this wire between the electrode pieces and pushing them together against the wire. This is done on both ends of the laser electrodes. Sometimes slight width adjustments beyond this will optimize the output of the laser. The biggest breakthrough though, in my ability to make TEA lasers work well was the addition of a piece of plastic on each end of an electrode (see photos). These pieces of plastic are very easy to grab hold of (without getting zapped) for adjusting the electrode spacing. With my hands resting on the table I find it relatively easy to make fine electrode spacing adjustments. The hot sparks that jump between the electrodes are a good indicator of how parallel the electrodes are. If they are not parallel, the sparks will tend to be concentrated near one end. Pulling that end slightly farther apart will usually move the sparks more toward the middle or to the opposite end. Try moving the sparks in this way while using different electrode spacings. Do this while watching a piece of sensitive paper near each end of the laser. When you get the adjustment right, you will experience the excitement of seeing a spot appear on one or both of the pieces of paper. When this happens you have a working laser! The paper can be made very ultraviolet sensitive by covering it with ink from a yellow highlight pen.  An improvement would be some kind of screw adjuster at each end of the electrode rails. These lasers typically emit a beam out of both ends simultaneously. It is sometimes possible however, to get the beam to emit from just one end by slightly widening the laser electrode spacing at that end.  I did just a little bit of experimenting with a mirror on one end of the TEA laser. The mirrors that I used were far from anything you would consider to be of laser quality. One of the mirrors that I tried was an aluminized front surface type that I made many years ago. Therefore I would say that I do not yet have much to say on the subject of applying mirrors to TEA lasers. Whenever I tried using a mirror however, I put it on the end opposite the sensitive paper. I aligned the mirror by watching its reflection on the paper and aligning the reflection so that it was exactly on top of the spot made by the beam. In these cases, I did not observe anything that seemed significant in spot brightness.  If you adjust the electrode gap to make the beam emit out of one end, how does that compare to using a mirror on the end of a laser that is putting a beam out of both ends?\n That is a good question that I can not answer yet.  The construction of the spark gap is done pretty much as the photos show. It appears to be quite obvious that inductance in the spark gap assembly has less of a detrimental effect than it does in the capacitors and electrode rails. You can see from the photos that current flows through a relatively great distance (up one angle aluminum and down another) as it passes through the spark gap. If current had to flow this far up and away through the electrode rails, there would be absolutely no laser action. A path like this through the electrode rails would create a prohibitive amount of inductance yet, the laser works just fine with a path like this through the spark gap. A TEA laser will work well with almost any spark gap that is placed between one of the capacitor plates and ground. A TEA laser will also work very well when one of the electrode rails is used as one side of the spark gap. A grounded piece of metal can simply be placed near one of the electrode rails. The distance across the spark gap can be between 1/16 to 1/8 inch. You have not said much in this article about the theory of TEA lasers and how they work. Where can I find out more about them?\n One of the best places to go is to the Professors Web Site. Mark Csele gives a lot of great info about TEA lasers and lasers in general.
