"note_en": "Google has been ordered to pay $40,000 in damages to a Melbourne lawyer after a Supreme Court of Victoria ruling found the internet giant was a publisher, and had defamed the man.\n Google had argued the automation of its search engines meant it was not a publisher\n George Defteros has successfully sued Google over web searches that brought up his name in relation to associations with Victoria&#39;s gangland figures.\n In today&#39;s ruling, Justice Melinda Richards has determined that Google was a publisher, despite denials by the company.\n The case centred on articles and images published by The Age newspaper in 2004, after Mr Defteros was charged with conspiracy over the murder of Carl Williams and other underworld figures.\n At the time, Mr Defteros ran a legal firm in Melbourne whose clients included gangland figures.\n The charges were dropped the following year, but Mr Defteros had surrendered his practising certificate for three years.\n Mr Defteros argued that in 2016 and 2017, searches on Google continued to turn up articles and hyperlinks to web material that defamed him, including an entry in the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia.\n  During a trial last year, Google&#39;s lawyers had argued it was not the publisher of the material and it had not defamed Mr Defteros.\n It submitted that the automation of its search engines meant it was not an intentional communicator of words or images, particularly if a user clicked through to another website.\n  &#34;The Google search engine \u2026 is not a passive tool,&#34; she wrote in her 98-page judgement.\n &#34;It is designed by humans who work for Google to operate in the way it does, and in such a way that identified objectionable content can be removed, by human intervention.\n &#34;I find that Google becomes a publisher of the search results that its search engine returns to a user who enters a search query.&#34;\n She also found that providing the hyperlink within the search results &#34;amounted to publication of the webpage&#34;.\n Justice Richards found some of the images were still brought up in internet searches up until March of last year \u2014 but publication of those images was not &#34;substantial&#34;.\n  Google had argued in the case that it was for the &#34;common convenience and welfare of society&#34; that it provided search results directly relevant to search terms and that in fact it had a &#34;duty&#34; to respond to searches.\n It also contended that there would be a &#34;chilling effect on freedom of speech&#34; if Google users were not able to readily locate relevant content.\n &#34;I could not be satisfied that it was reasonable for Google to rely on Wikipedia as a reputable source, given that its own Guidelines acknowledge the variable quality of Wikipedia pages,&#34; Justice Richards wrote.\n  In assessing the damages relevant to the defamation, Justice Richards looked at how many users had seen the articles and images and found publication was &#34;limited&#34;.\n She also analysed the degree of defamation, which she said was at the &#34;less serious end of the spectrum&#34;.\n &#34;I accept it was painful for Mr Defteros to be reminded of that time, which he has tried to put behind him,&#34; she wrote.\n   In a statement, Mr Defteros said the decision was &#34;a win towards restoring my reputation&#34; but he was &#34;disappointed with the amount of damages&#34;.\n &#34;Her Honour has found that Google is a publisher of the defamatory imputations once Google receives notice of a defamatory publication online as a result of the use of its search engine,&#34; he said.\n &#34;We are considering our position, and we will be taking advice from our legal team going forward.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-02

"note_en": "What if progress in Neural Networks came so far that now we can build systems that excel not only in classifying or detecting, but on generating something unique with style of given object, for example your text to Yoda speech?\n As first works of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs in short)  appeared in 2014, this field made huge steps forward and some astonishing breakthroughs. We have all heard about image style transfer: extracting the style from a famous painting and applying it to another image.\n  Examples of artwork generated with the Image Style Transfer algorithm But today we will look deeper into voice generation tutorial showing how to train Yoda text to speech model and in the end we will have complete Yoda voice by given text:\n  Also we will show you pipeline to generate voice of any character by few samples with his voice and even your own\n    We will use  Real-Time-Voice-Cloning which is an implementation of  Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time\n The goal of the underlined paper was to build a TTS system which can generate natural speech for a variety of speakers in a data efficient manner with addressing a zero-shot learning setting, where a few seconds of untranscribed reference audio from a target speaker is used to synthesize new speech in that speaker&#39;s voice, without updating any model parameters\n  But how the underlying idea of Image Style Transfer can be applied to sound? There is the way of converting audio signals to image-like 2-dimensional representation called &#34; Spectrogram&#34;, and it&#39;s the key for using specifically designed computer vision algorithms for audio-related tasks.\n   Let&#39;s take a closer look on what spectrogram really is. Given 1 dimension time-domain signal we want to obtain a  time-frequency 2-dimensional representation. In order to achieve that, the Short-Time  Fourier Transform with a window of a certain length on the audio signal was applied, considering only the squared magnitude of the result.\n  In order to make spectrograms even more useful for our task, each &#34; pixel&#34; (or magnitude value) conversion to the  decibel scale had place, getting the log of each value.\n Finally, by converting spectrograms to the  mel scale and applying a mel filter bank we will get &#34; mel-spectrograms&#34;\n    This allows each part to be trained on independent data, reducing the need to obtain high quality, multispeaker data.\n   Speaker encoder recieves input audio encoded as mel spectrogram frames of given speaker and process an embedding that captures &#34;how the speaker sounds.&#34;  It doesn&#39;t care about the words or background noise, rather than the voice features of the speaker such as high/low pitched voice, accent, tone, etc.\n All of these features are combined into a low dimensional vector, known formally as d-vector, or informally as the speaker embedding\n   The synthesizer takes a sequence of text\u200a-\u200amapped to  phonemes (the smallest units of human sound, e.g., the sound you make when saying &#39;a&#39;), along with embeddings produced by the speaker encoder, and uses the  Tacotron 2 architecture to generate frames of a mel spectrogram recurrently\n   In order to convert mel spectrogram made by the synthesizer into raw audio waves, the authors use a vocoder.\n It&#39;s based on DeepMind&#39;s  WaveNet model, that generates raw audio waveforms from text, and was at one point state-of-the-art for TTS systems.\n   Now when you familiar with theory and how it&#39;s implemented in real life, we will run the solution with  google colab notebook in order to receive immediate results with GPU on board, no matter what&#39;s device or hardware you use.\n   Follow described instructions from notebook bellow to synthesize Yoda&#39;s voice.\u00a0 Furthermore, in the end of it, you will have the opportunity to synthesize your own voice, so have fun with it!\n  What if progress in Neural Networks came so far that now we can build systems that excel not only in classifying or detecting, but on generating something unique with style of given object, for example your text to Yoda speech?

"note_en": "Christopher Wray, the FBI director who has been one of the  fiercest critics of encryption under the Trump administration, previously worked as a lawyer for WhatsApp, where he defended the practice, according to new court filings.\n The documents, which were released late on Wednesday night as part of an unrelated matter, show Wray worked for  WhatsApp in 2015 while he was an attorney for the Washington law firm of King &amp; Spalding.\n While there are sparse details about the precise nature of the work, the filings indicate that Wray strongly defended the need for end-to-end encryption in his previous representation of WhatsApp, the popular messaging application owned by  Facebook.\n Wray\u2019s earlier work \u2013 which has not previously been public \u2013 contradicts his current position on encryption, which protects users\u2019 communications and other data from being read by outsiders.\n The Trump administration and major technology companies like Facebook have been at odds over the need to offer customers encryption services, with the White House and law enforcement officials arguing the technology represents a security risk by protecting the communication of terrorists and criminals.\n Wray defended the administration\u2019s position as recently as February, when he claimed law enforcement would in effect be severely hampered if Facebook decided to move forward with plans to offer users end-to-end encryption in its messaging platform.\n \u201cWe have to have mechanisms to allow lawful access to protect flesh and blood Americans,\u201d Wray said at a congressional hearing. \u201cIf Facebook moves forward with the plans they have at the moment, we will be blinded.\u201d\n In a statement, the FBI said Wray could not comment on the scope of his representation. \u201cWhen he was an attorney in private practice [Director Wray] represented his clients \u2019interests and advocated on their behalf, as a result of which he earned a reputation as a highly skilled and sought-after legal professional. Like all other lawyers, his duty of loyalty was to his client, and he did not put his personal views ahead of his clients \u2019interests or allow them to affect the legal work he did  ...\n News about Wray\u2019s representation of WhatsApp was released as part of a legal dispute between WhatsApp and attorneys representing NSO Group, the Israeli spyware maker.\n WhatsApp has claimed that it is improper for NSO Group to be represented in their dispute by King &amp; Spalding given the firm\u2019s previous work for WhatsApp. It declined to provide more details about the previous case, which is

"note_en": "Planet of the Humans, which takes aim at the green movement, is \u2018full of misinformation\u2019, says one online library\n    A new Michael Moore-produced documentary that takes aim at the supposed hypocrisy of the green movement is \u201cdangerous, misleading and destructive\u201d and should be removed from public viewing, according to an assortment of climate scientists and environmental campaigners.\n The film,  Planet of the Humans, was released on the eve of Earth Day last week by its producer, Michael Moore, the baseball cap-wearing documentarian known for Fahrenheit 9/11 and  Bowling for Columbine. Describing itself as a \u201cfull-frontal assault on our sacred cows \u201d, the film argues that electric cars and solar energy are unreliable and rely upon fossil fuels to function. It also attacks figures including Al Gore for bolstering corporations that push flawed technologies over real solutions to  ...\n Planet of the Humans has provoked a furious reaction from scientists and campaigners, however, who have called for it be taken down. Films for Action, an online library of videos, temporarily took down the film after  describing it as \u201cfull o f misinformation\u201d, though they later reinstated it, saying they did not want accusations of censorship to give the film \u201cmore power and mystique than it deserves\u201d.  A free version on YouTube  has been viewed more than 3m times.\n A  letter written by Josh Fox, who made the documentary  Gasland, and signed by various scientists and activists, has urged the removal of \u201cshockingly misleading and absurd\u201d film for making false claims about renewable energy. Planet of the Humans \u201ctrades in debunked fossil fuel industry talking points\u201d that question the affordability and reliability of solar and wind energy, the letter states, pointing out that these alternatives are now cheaper to run than fossil fuels such as coal.\n Michael Mann, a climate scientist and signatory to Fox\u2019s letter, said the film includes \u201cvarious distortions, half-truths and lies\u201d and that the filmmakers \u201chave done a grave disservice to us and the planet by promoting climate change inactivist tropes and talking points.\u201d The film\u2019s makers did not respond to questions over whether it will be pulled down.\n Planet of the Humans has been shown at Moore\u2019s Traverse City film festival, where the producer said it was \u201cperhaps the most urgent film we\u2019ve shown in the 15-year history of our film festival\u201d. Jeff Gibbs, who wrote and directed the film, has suggested that unrestrained economic and population growth should be the target of environmentalists\u2019 efforts rather than technological fixes.\n  Climate activist  Bill McKibben, one of the targets for the film for allegedly being influenced by corporate money and for supporting the burning of biomass such as wood chips for energy, said the characterisations are untrue. McKibben has previously changed his views on biomass energy, which he now sees as being detrimental to climate action, and claims he has \u201cnever taken a penny in pay\u201d from any environmental group.\n \u201cI am used to ceaseless harassment and attack from the fossil fuel industry, and I\u2019ve done my best to ignore a lifetime of death threats from rightwing extremists,\u201d McKibben said. \u201cIt does hurt more to be attacked by others who think of themselves as environmentalists.\u201d\n Renewable energy has long been portrayed as expensive and unreliably intermittent by oil and gas companies and their lobby groups, which have spent several decades questioning the veracity of climate science and undermining efforts to radically reduce planet-heating emissions.\n In fact, the technology used for wind and solar energy has improved markedly in recent years, while the costs have plummeted. While electric cars often require fossil fuel-generated energy to produce them and provide the electricity to fuel them,  research has shown they still emit less greenhouse gas and air pollutants over their lifetime than a standard petrol or diesel car.

"note_en": "The breathtaking slowdown in global aviation is taking a huge toll on Boeing, which said on Wednesday that it would slash about 16,000 jobs after reporting that revenue tumbled by 26 percent in the first three months of the year.\n \u201cThe global pandemic has changed the way we live and work,\u201d said Boeing\u2019s chief executive, David L. Calhoun, in a note to staff. \u201cIt is changing our industry. We are facing utterly unexpected challenges.\u201d\n Airlines around the world are trying to stay alive, with losses expected to total more than $300 billion by year\u2019s end, according to an industry trade group. As a result, many carriers are delaying purchases, deliveries and maintenance.\n Boeing said it was slowing aircraft production, including for the troubled 737 Max, the 787, the 777 and the 777x. The company is also exploring ways to raise more capital, either from the federal government or from financial markets. The job cuts, about 10 percent of Boeing\u2019s staff, will be even steeper for those employed in the divisions most exposed to the downturn, the commercial airplanes and services businesses. Staff cuts in those units will be about 15 percent.\n \u201cI know this news is a blow during an already challenging time,\u201d Mr. Calhoun said in the note. \u201cI regret the impact this will have on many of you. I sincerely wish there were some other way.\u201d\n  Boeing reported a net loss of $641 million in the first quarter, compared with a $2.1 billion profit a year earlier.\n The company has said that it does not expect air travel to recover to levels reached before the pandemic for three years and that it would most likely take several years more for travel to return to its previous long-term growth rate.\n Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft business was especially hard hit in the first quarter by the grounding of the Max and the pandemic, with revenues for that business down nearly 50 percent, to $6.2 billion, from a year earlier. Total revenue dropped to $16.9 billion. The company received just 49 new orders and had 196 cancellations between January and March.\n On Tuesday, Southwest Airlines said it had been negotiating a reduction in the number of 737 Max jets that it would accept this year. Southwest said it would now receive no more than 48 Max jets by the end of 2021, instead of the 107 it had previously expected to take.\n Boeing said it hoped to reach its job cut targets through voluntary means, including buyouts and early-retirement offers. Employees who take the buyout will receive three months of health care and one week of pay for every year they have worked at Boeing, up to 26 years, the company told workers last week. Employees have until Monday to signal their interest in buyouts. If approved, they would leave in early June.\n Any cuts are likely to be disproportionately focused on Boeing\u2019s facilities in Washington State and South Carolina, home to its three major commercial aircraft factories. A  weekslong shutdown of operations at those facilities disrupted production of passenger planes but also affected Boeing\u2019s defense and space business.\n While Boeing is struggling to manage the effect of the pandemic, the company this week also expressed concern for the health of its suppliers, which receive about 70 percent of the company\u2019s revenues.\n \u201cCurrently, our team is focused on the best ways to keep liquidity flowing through our industry and to our supply chain until our customers are buying airplanes and related services again,\u201d Mr. Calhoun told shareholders on Monday.\n To that end, the company has taken out a loan, cut costs and suspended dividend payments and stock buybacks, he said. Boeing has $15.5 billion in cash on hand, but plans to raise more capital soon. In an interview on CNBC on Wednesday, Mr. Calhoun did not specify whether some of that would be in the form of  federal aid.\n On Wednesday, Boeing also said it had suffered more than $2 billion in one-off costs in the first quarter.\n A slower-than-expected ramp-up in production of the 737 Max, which was grounded last year after two fatal crashes, subtracted about $1 billion from the company\u2019s bottom line. And it incurred a pretax charge of $827 million for the KC-46A Tanker, most of it stemming from repairs Boeing agreed to make this month  after discussions with the Air Force.\n The company took a $336 million charge for repairs on the 737 Next Generation aircraft, and the four-week suspension of work at Boeing\u2019s facilities in Washington State cost the company about $137 million.\n Over the weekend, Boeing also announced that it was  terminating its $4.2 billion deal to buy an 80 percent stake of Embraer\u2019s commercial jet business. Embraer is contesting that move and said Monday that it had begun arbitration proceedings.\n   If you\u2019ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n  This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on  how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \u201cHow will we know when to reopen the country?\u201d In  an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson  staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs  ...\n  The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts  donations here.  Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the  American Red Cross, and  World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related  GoFundMe fund-raisershave started  ...\n  The C.D.C. has  recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting  new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don \u2019t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they  ...\n  If you\u2019re sick and you think you\u2019ve been exposed to the new coronavirus,  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there\u2019s a chance \u2014 because of a lack of testing kits or because you\u2019re asymptomatic, for instance \u2014 you won\u2019t be able to get tested.\n  It seems to spread  very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n  No.  Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n  Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and  little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions \u2014 not just those with respiratory diseases \u2014 particularly hard.\n  If the family member doesn\u2019t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible,  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C.If there \u2019s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not  ...\n  Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves,  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n  Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don\u2019t live in your home.  Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n  That\u2019s not a good idea. Even if you\u2019re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year\u2019s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n  Watching your balance go up and down can be scary.  You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions \u2014 don\u2019t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you\u2019re at least saving as much as you can to get that \u201cfree money.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:51:22", "tags":

"note_en": "For a while now I have been contemplating a series of seminars titled  &#34;Everyproof assistant&#34; that would be devoted to all the different proof assistantsout there. Apart from the established ones( Isabelle/HOL,  Coq, Agda, Lean), there are other interesting experimentalproof assistants, and some that are still under development, or just proofs ofconcept. I would like to know more about them, and I suspect I am not the onlyone.\n Getting the authors of proof assistants to travel to Ljubljana and giving talksat our  Foundations of mathematics and theoretical computerscienceseminar has largely become impossible. But luckily research seminars world-wideare rapidly moving online, and so is our Foundations seminar. I am thereforedelighted to announce the first &#34;Every proof assistant&#34; seminar:\n Time: Thursday, April 30, 2020 from 18:00 to 19:00 (Central European Summer Time, UTC+2)  Location: online at  Zoom ID 965 4439 5816  Speaker:  Valery Isaev (JetBrains research)\n  Abstract:I will discuss Arend, a proof assistant developed at JetBrainsResearch. The aim of Arend is to provide a powerful system for formalizationresults in homotopy type theory and in ordinary mathematics. To achieve thelatter goal, we prove a flexible class system with subtyping, universepolymorphism with a powerful level inference mechanism, quotient sets with aconvenient pattern matching principles for them. We also recently implementeda tactic framework which can be used to automate  ...\n I have a couple more in the pipeline, so follow this blog, the  Foundations seminar announcements or my Twitter account  @andrejbauer.\n     Will PVS and ACL2 be covered. Both are in the Boyer-Moore family. ACL2 has a significant user based in hardware verification. PVS is used in the CPS community.\n  I am not sure what we will cover. We will start with proof assistants that are closer to the type-theoretic community, just because I know the scenery there better.\n PVS and ACL2 definitely belong to the &#34;established&#34; group, together with Coq, Agda, Lean, Isabelle etc. We will get to those eventually.\n      Will these talked be recorded and put out somewhere? They look extremely interesting and it would be a same to miss them.\n      My proof editor (DC Proof) is a very simple system based on my own versions of natural deduction and set theory which you may find interesting in themselves. DC Proof was designed to introduce math undergrads to the basic methods of proof.\n I am an amateur software developer. I am not associated with any academic institution and have no postgraduate degrees.\n  I messed up the time zones and missed the first talk.Any chance a recording will be available?Looking forward to the series!\n  The seminars will be recorded and the videos will be published online. See the link above for the first video. I will also provide links to the proof assistants.\n If you would like to suggest a proof assistant, please contact me by e-mail. I took note of the suggestions in the comments.\n Write your comment using  Markdown.

"note_en": "AI startup companies have been emerging at breakneck speed for the past few years, all the while touting TOPS benchmark data. But what does it really mean and does a TOPS number apply across every application? Answer: It depends on a variety of factors.\n Historically, every class of design has used some kind of standard benchmark for both product development and positioning. For example, SPECint, dhrystone, and geekbench are used as a set of benchmark programs for processor performance. RFC 2544 is used to benchmark networking ASICs. But the development of more customized and heterogeneous hardware, coupled with continuous updates in AI algorithms, has made decisions based on benchmarks murky at best.\n \u201cIn recent years, we have seen a lot of advancements in hardware choices available for AI \u2013 from GPUs to FPGAs to custom hardware ASICs,\u201d said Anoop Saha, market development manager at Mentor, a Siemens Business. \u201cHowever, the existing benchmarks are not suitable for measuring how the hardware will work for AI applications \u2013 either in training or in inference.\u201d\n Currently, TOPS (tera operations per second) is the most common metric used for describing the performance of many hardware design. But buyer beware.\n \u201cThere are a zillion companies out there doing inference, and they make a lot of claims, \u201dsaid Steve Teig, CEO of Perceive. \u201cMany of those claims are overblown. When people say, \u2018I have this many TOPS and this many TOPS per watt, \u2019I encourage them to poke at that. I do that when I look at other people \u2019s claims. I think, \u2018You claim you run this network at this speed, and you can look up on the web how many ops is this network at that speed. You could figure it out then determine how many TOPS  ...\n Understanding what makes up a TOPS number requires understanding of what exactly is being tested. But that does little for providing the context for how a device will behave in the real world.\n \u201cTOPS measures only the performance of a chip, \u201dsaid Saha. \u201cPower consumption is a bigger challenge in acceleration of neural networks. That is because of the highly parallel nature of these algorithms, which also have significant memory accesses. A better metric is TOPS per watt \u2014performance per unit of energy. Indeed, most datasheets of AI hardware now describe both TOPS and TOPS per watt as a metric, and both are important. TOPS per watt is even more important for edge devices compared to  ...\n A TOPS number also can vary depending on whether it is measuring fixed or floating point operations, according to Pulin Desai, group director for product marketing, management and business development at Cadence. \u201cFor fixed-point operations, usually people will use tera ops numbers. Sometimes they may throw in some floating point operations and refer to giga ops, which is floating point operations per second. A third thing engineering groups say is, \u2018I don \u2019t care about raw capacity. You have  ...\n Looking deeper To understand a TOPS number requires some investigative work. For example, what type of operations are included in that number? If a product is running at 1GHz with 2,048 8-bit operations, that equals 2,048 times 1,024 giga ops, or 2 TOPS. But if it\u2019s really 4-bit operations, the number of 4-bit operations might be able to be doubled and it may be advertised as 20 TOPS.\n \u201cGenerally, we tend to stick to 8-bit because most of the inference happening today is on 8-bit, \u201dDesai said. \u201cAnd that \u2019s a multiply accumulate operation. But now insert a DSP, where there are a lot of parallels operations. If there is another operation in parallel, because it \u2019s a parallel device, you have to add up the 2,048 multiplier accumulator operations plus this other 8-bit operation. More simply, I say the number of MAC operations and number of 8-bit operations. You add those up  ...\n This kind of detail is essential to determine exactly what is being measured. \u201cIf somebody was giving you the tera ops numbers, then what type of data types is it \u20142-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit? What did you use? If you calculated tera ops, what frequency did you assume? And is your device only doing this operation, or are there some other operations happening in parallel? If they gave the information on a particular network, then the same question applies. \u2018Did you use fixed point to give  ...\n This is far from an objective analysis, however. Performance can vary depending on the optimizations done on the network, such as pruning, quantization and compression. Many machine learning models can provide similar accuracy with a low precision integer model instead of using floating point operations. So a TOPS per watt for a hardware using a 32-bit-integer precision would be different from that with 8-bit-integer precision. Depending on the accuracy they require, the user can decide  ...\n The bigger question is which applications should be run to provide accurate benchmark metrics. \u201cFor a while now, common networks like MobileNet, ImageNet and ResNet are used for those metrics, \u201dSaha said. \u201cWhat is needed is a standardized set of benchmark applications, which are not only fair and exhaustive, but which have a common dataset to avoid any variations that can happen from the datasets. MLPerf is an industry initiative aimed at developing a standardized benchmark applications  ...\n Benchmarking in context In all of this it is helpful to remember this is a relatively immature market developing literally by the day, noted Andrew Grant, senior director for artificial intelligence at Imagination Technologies. \u201cThings are changing all the time, so for any sort of chip architect or SoC architect they \u2019ve got a lot of stuff to take in and try to understand. If you look at mature markets like CPUs where CoreMark and things like that are quite important \u2014or if you look at  ...\n With AI, there are different benchmarks to look at different aspects of performance. \u201cBut even then, you end up with a situation where if you \u2019re looking at say, a mobile GPU, then how that particular GPU performs over a period of time and what its drain on the battery is could be really important. But that isn \u2019t taken into account by the pixel drawing aspects of that benchmark, \u201dGrant explained. \u201cWhen we look at the AI benchmarks themselves, remember that the whole artificial intelligence,  ...\n To make matters more confusing, different benchmarks apply at different levels in the development of an SoC. In Imagination \u2019s case, because its IP will then go into someone else \u2019s SoC, a lot of the benchmark activity is related directly to a particular network under a particular set of circumstances. \u201cWe are often asked whether we can run a representative network of what the customer is likely to actually use, and then we will work through and run that on a GPU or run that on our  ...\n Beyond MLPerf, a number of organizations are seeking to establish a more comprehensive basket as a benchmark. This is similar to what happened in the CPU and GPU space. For instance, AI-Benchmark.com does a lot of work on networks that already have made their way into silicon.\n What is needed today is a common understanding of what the different areas of AI benchmarks mean, and what the implications are for unbalanced benchmarks. \u201cThere are examples in GPU-land where manufacturers end up having to chase a particular benchmark, because that \u2019s one of the common benchmarks that is quoted, although it may no longer be relevant for the users. You end up in that rather strange situation where the numbers that have been displayed on the billboard are great, but  ...\n  Benchmark accuracy Beyond all of this is the accuracy of the AI benchmark results. \u201cThis is a key point that was introduced in the latest version of AI-Benchmark, \u201dsaid Salvatore De Dominicis, application engineering manager for AI at Imagination. \u201cWhen you \u2019re analyzing a quantized network, there is a very high risk of losing precision and getting a result that is not actually accurate unless the IP is designed in a way to preserve precision and accuracy when it \u2019s needed. This  ...\n Accomplishing all of this, while also maintaining performance and low power consumption, is non-trivial. \u201cThis is why the benchmark vendors like AI-Benchmark actually pushed the introduction of this new category, \u201dDe Dominicis said. \u201cBasically, the score is heavily influenced by the quality of the results, which is in the optic of the whole market being quite new. So the situation is not stable. Things are moving. Initially there were a lot of solutions that had at first looked  ...\n To make IP more accurate requires designing the hardware so that the internal precision is kept high when necessary, De Dominicis noted. \u201cThe problem then becomes understanding when it \u2019s necessary, because you obviously don \u2019t want to pay the cost everywhere. Otherwise, you will have increasing area and power consumption. The idea is that you want to have a good final accuracy. This means that the output of the network is as close as possible to the theoretical output. We provide  ...\n Implications of architectural choices Once the applications and the metrics are well-defined, designers face a critical choice. \u201cWhat are the levers they can play with to get optimal performance and power metrics? Choosing the right architecture is extremely vital here, because they have the biggest ROI for improving results, \u201dSaha said. \u201cHere, too, one size does not fit all. A designer will need to align the goals and use cases to select the right architecture. Whether it is  ...\n Finding the optimial architecture requires running the benchmark applications as early as possible, getting accurate performance and power numbers, and having the ability to tweak the architecture quickly. And then, repeat everything. In other words, system architects need to take a build-measure-learn approach to create a use case-based optimized architecture for the AI hardware.\n \u201cThere is a special class of application specific hardware accelerators, typically used in edge or IoT devices, \u201dSaha said. \u201cThe use cases would be limited to a few specific neural network algorithms. Making the right architecture choices become even more vital for these accelerators, which must be tuned for the application. For example, in a deep neural network, different layers might need different architectures. Some layers might have a millions of weights, which need to  ...\n Looking ahead Within this rapidly evolving area, the challenges are constantly evolving. A network may not be the right one, or there might be a newer one coming.\n \u201cThe newer one may require more processing capacity, or they may require some different kind of things, \u201dsaid Cadence \u2019s Desai. \u201cDevelopment teams end up looking at two levels. First, they make sure they have a scalable solution because they need flexibility or future proofing. This is about having the ability to respond to the changes in the marketplace by having a flexible architecture. It could be flexible in terms of programmability or how they make it. It could be scalable.  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:50:57", "tags": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd,\u57fa\u51c6,world,\u64cd\u4f5c,benchmark", "title": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u9ed1\u6697\u4e16\u754c", "title_en": "The Murky World of AI Benchmarks", "transed": 0, "url": "https://semiengineering.com/the-murky-world-of-ai-benchmarks/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd", "\u57fa\u51c6", "world", "\u64cd\u4f5c", "benchmark"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000105, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4f60\u62c5\u5fc3\u6cc4\u9732\u4f60\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5730\u5740\u5417\uff1f\u538c\u5026\u4e86\u6536\u5230\u4f60\u4ece\u672a\u6ce8\u518c\u8fc7\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5417\uff1f\u90a3\u4e9b\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u771f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5417\uff1f\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u522b\u540d\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u60a8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u8fdc\u79bb\u5783\u573e\u90ae\u4ef6\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u8fdc\u79bb\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u7c97\u7565\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u5f53\u8868\u5355\u9700\u8981\u60a8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5730\u5740\u65f6\uff0c\u8bf7\u5355\u51fb\u201c\u4e2d\u7ee7\u201d\u6309\u94ae\u63d0\u4f9b\u522b\u540d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4f1a\u5c06\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u4ece\u522b\u540d\u8f6c\u53d1\u5230\u60a8\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6536\u4ef6\u7bb1\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u4efb\u4f55\u522b\u540d\u5f00\u59cb\u63a5\u6536\u60a8\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5176\u7981\u7528\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u5220\u9664\u3002", "note_en": "Do you worry about giving away your email address?

"note_en": "With interchangeable lenses and a 12-MP sensor, the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera provides a lot more flexibility and resolution than other modules.\n   The Raspberry Pi Camera Module is one of those add ons that we love to play with. Creating images and videos using a $35   Raspberry Pi in real time is still mind blowing for most. You can even use your   Raspberry Pi as a \u00a0PC webcam. But the two previous first-party camera modules have suffered with a fixed focus, albeit good quality, lens and fragile construction.\n  Enter the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera, a new module that ups the image quality with a new 12-MP sensor and supports interchangeable lenses and tripod-mounting. The module is larger and, at $50 without any of the required lenses, quite a bit more expensive than prior models, but the increased resolution and flexibility make it a great choice for photography-intensive projects.\n    A 12.3 megapixel Sony IMX477R sensor on the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera offers significantly more pixels than the 8-MP Pi Camera V2, the previous first-party module which will remain on sale. The camera is also much larger than previous models, measuring 38mm square, versus 24mm by 23mm for the V2.\n The reason for the size increase is due to an interchangeable C mount where compatible lenses (sold seperately) can be screwed into place. The included adapter will also enable CS lenses to be used with the camera.\n  At the four corners of the camera are M2.5 screw holes, which can be used to mechanically connect the camera to an object / frame. At the base of the camera is a 0.25-inch screw point for connecting the camera to a standard photography tripod.\n The final hardware feature is the inclusion of a 200mm ribbon cable compatible with the CSI (camera) connector on all models of Pi, with the exception of the Pi Zero range which requires an adapter for the later boards. Take care when inserting the cable into your powered down Raspberry Pi as the connection is fragile.\n When using the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera, you will need to have a reliable power source. In our tests with a Raspberry Pi 4 we found that the screen would blank when taking an image due to the amount of power being used. The solution is to use the official Raspberry Pi USB charger or another which provides at least 3 amps and 5 volts of reliable juice.\n  The camera is nothing without a lens, and in our supplied review unit we tested a 6mm CCTV C mount lens and a 16mm CS mount lens. The lenses retail for $15 and $50 respectively and you\u2019ll need to buy one right away because the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera module doesn\u2019t include one in the box.\n  To use any of the official cameras with a Raspberry Pi we first need to enable the camera interface in the Raspberry Pi Configuration tool (sudo raspi-config)l. Then, after a reboot, we can start taking pictures.\n You may be thinking that we could use the Raspberry PI High Quality Camera with applications such as Cheese or guvcview, but sadly this is not easily done, and in our tests the images created with Cheese had a nasty purple tint, and guvcview would refuse to start with the camera connected. Hopefully, future software updates will resolve these issues.\n   However, on the bright side, the Chromium browser did recognize the Raspberry Pi High Quality Cameras as a webcam and we were able to use it successfully in Google Meet. Presumably, any other web-based camera application would work just as well.\n   The first time we take a picture with any official camera, we use raspistill, Raspbian\u2019s built-in capture command, which can quickly show if the camera is connected and working as expected. To test the focus of the camera we ran raspistill with the -k switch, which enabled us to set the focus of the lens.\n The Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera\u2019s maximum resolution is 4056 x 3040 pixels (5K) and this produces an image of around 6MB in size. Images are typically saved as JPG, but we can also select RAW, GIF, BMP, PNG, YUV420, RG8888 file formats.\n Another way to capture images and video is via the Picamera Python module which enables the camera to be used in projects powered by the popular programming language. With Picamera we can trigger the camera to take an image / video using sensors and inputs connected to the GPIO. At the time of writing the Picamera library has basic functionality and can record 1080p video and 5K images, and also manipulate the images on the fly. Enhanced functionality for the Raspberry Pi High Quality  ...\n  The previous camera modules provided a decent entry into photography with Raspberry Pi, but they images that were at best \u201cgood \u201d. With a fixed focus lens, the subject had to be brought to the lens and composition was cramped. Version 2 of the Raspberry Pi Camera Module did feature a focus ring to alter the focus of the camera. But this required a special tool to rotate, otherwise you&#39;d risk scratching the lens. Color reproduction was poor and image quality was grainy. But for  ...\n With the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera, we see much sharper images with rich colors. A manually controlled focus means that we can compose our shots and focus in on specific areas and blur out the rest of the shot for that professional look.\n  We took the same shots using the older V2 camera and the new High Quality Camera and as you can see the images are vastly superior with the new camera.\n Overall the image quality with the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera is much better. Indoors and out, we were able to take clear images and change the light levels manually and focus our shots according to the subject. Sadly the weather was not with us at the time of review; rain and electronics rarely mix so further testing will be conducted and added to the review.\n   To record video on the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera, \u00a0we can use the Python Picamera library or we can use  &lt;CODE&gt;raspivid&lt;/CODE&gt; in the terminal. The video output from the latter is in H264 format, which can be played using the VLC or omxplayer media players. At the time of writing the playback is not perfect, and can jump around erratically from time to time. But playing the same video on our Lenovo laptop provided a smooth experience.\n So can the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera capture 4K video? Sorry, no. The best is still 1080p at 30 fps. We did push the camera a little further and managed to get 1080p at 60fps, but it was a little glitchy. To capture higher fps videos we need to drop the resolution. We captured decent footage at 800x600 120fps but it was a little glitchy. We found that converting the video to m4v via the excellent Handbrake video conversion tool provided much better playback.\n   Yes it will, if you have a Pi Zero with the small CSI connector then you can connect up the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera Module and use it in a project. We tested 1080p video recording and still images at max resolution on a Pi Zero. All worked well, if a little slowly compared to a Pi 4. So if you are planning to use the Pi Zero with this camera, don\u2019t expect high speed reactions for trail cameras or home security. But you will get great results.\n The Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera is designed to work with the majority of Pi. The only exception being the first generation of Pi Zero which have no CSI port. But which model is best? Well for larger still images we need to use more GPU memory, around 256MB for a 5K image. So the absolute minimum Pi would be a Pi 2. But for the best results a Pi 3B+ or 4 would be the boards to aim for.\n   If you \u2019re really serious about using a Pi to capture really good images, the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera is your best choice. At $50 for the module plus at least $15 for a lens, the High Quality Camera doesn \u2019t come cheap, particularly when you can buy the Module V2 for under $30 or third-party modules for less than $10. However, if you can spend the premium, the ability to mount the High Quality Camera to a tripod alone is worth the cost of admission and the higher-quality  ...\n     I&#39;ve noticed this post talks a lot about the ability to focus the lens on the High Quality Camera, and the inability to do so on the V2 Pi Camera, however you can change the focus on the V2 Pi Camera. Earlier models of the camera (and most third-party clones) have the focus fixed with a dot of glue (even these can be adjusted with enough effort, though I wouldn&#39;t want to suggest everyone do that - it&#39;s definitely worth just grabbing a V2 camera) but the V2 Pi Camera module is a lot easier  ...\n   Reply", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:50:50", "tags": "\u76f8\u673a,raspberry

"note_en": "Canonical, the parent company of \u00a0 Ubuntu Linux, is doing better than ever according to\u00a0 founder and CEO Mark Shuttleworth. Indeed, Canonical is now &#34;self-sustaining.&#34; That is, &#34;We&#39;re now well past the point where Ubuntu and all its supporting systems and infrastructure are dependent on me, said Shuttleworth. &#34;If I were to meet my maker tomorrow. Ubuntu will continue in the very capable hands of the team at Canonical and the community.&#34;\n Canonical is a private company, wholly owned by Shuttleworth, so we don&#39;t know its financial details. However, because the company is based on the Isle of Man, it&#39;s incorporated and registered through the  UK Companies House. and must still file an annual report.\n These reports, unlike US public company reports under the  Security and Exchanges Commission, aren&#39;t timely. The  latest annual Canonical report, for example, was filed on October 15, 2019, and only covers the company&#39;s finances through December 31, 2018.\n While Canonical doesn&#39;t have the kind of revenue Red Hat has--almost a  billion dollars of revenue a quarter its last quarter before being acquired by IBM--the company has been profitable. In the first nine months of Canonical&#39;s 2019 fiscal year, the company had $83.43-million in gross revenue with $10.85-million in profits. A closer look reveals that Canonical has been profitable since 2018.\n Canonical&#39;s numbers don&#39;t look as impressive as Red Hat&#39;s revenue because, Shuttleworth noted, &#34;Ubuntu is much cheaper than RHEL.&#34; Another reason is that many corporate Linux users run their servers without contractual support. For example, while Ubuntu is easily the single most popular  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Linux instance according to  Cloud Market&#39;s latest analysis of operating systems, many of those instances are being run without  Ubuntu Advantagesupport  ...\n   That may change. Beginning with the  Ubuntu 20.04 release, Canonical now offers\u00a0 10 years of support for both the base operating system and 30,000 other associated open-source programs. It&#39;s a very attractive offering for companies that have committed to Linux. Shuttleworth said, &#34;Our strength is in the cloud. In the public clouds, we see tremendous demand.&#34;\n Shuttleworth still plans on taking Canonical public.\u00a0 But, there won&#39;t be a  Canonical Initial Public Offering (IPO) anytime soon. Shuttleworth explained:\n We are taking a cautious posture this year because it&#39;s difficult for us to know that&#39;s going on with our customers. We&#39;ve set specific targets for revenue and growth rates as preconditions effectively for an IPO. We feel we&#39;re very privileged in the way we operate makes us resilient in the face of the challenges of the pandemic. But of course our customers may be impacted. it&#39;s difficult for us to predict that now. I think we&#39;re now we will start to see the very  ...\n   Still, Shuttleworth remains certain Canonical and Ubuntu will prosper. As  TechRepublic columnist Matt Asay wrote, &#34; organizations will turn to open source as they seek to do more with less. They&#39;re not the only ones who see it that way. Dr. Dries Buytaert, co-founder and CTO of  Acquia, the  Drupal-based content management system (CMS) company observed, businesses turn to open source, because when an &#34;Economic downturn happens,  organizations, they have to lower their costs.  ...\n Ubuntu is already popular, affordable and works well on desktops, clouds, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Other businesses will face trouble in the upcoming recession, Canonical won&#39;t be one of them.

"note_en": "This is the COVID-19 CovidSim microsimulation model developed by the MRC Centre for GlobalInfectious Disease Analysis hosted at Imperial College, London.\n CovidSim models the transmission dynamics and severity of COVID-19 infections throughout a spatially and socially structuredpopulation over time. It enables modelling of how intervention policies andhealthcare provision affect the spread of COVID-19. With parameter changes, it can be usedto model other respiratory viruses, such as influenza.\n   \u26a0\ufe0f This model is in active development and so parameter name and behaviours, and output file formats will change without notice.\n \u26a0\ufe0f The model is stochastic. Multiple runs with different seeds should be undertaken to see average behaviour.\n \u26a0\ufe0f As with any mathematical model, it is easy to misconfigure inputs and therefore get meaningless outputs. The Imperial College COVID-19 team only endorses outputs it has itself generated.\n      Running the model for the whole of the UK requires approximately 20GB of RAM.Other regions will require different amounts of memory (some up to 256GB).\n It is strongly recommended to build the model with OpenMP support enabled toimprove performance on multi-core processors. 24 to 32 core Xeon systems giveoptimal performance for large (e.g. UK, US) populations.\n    IMPORTANT: This script uses test data only and is not a run reflective ofreal-world situations.\n   The Python script  run_sample.py demonstrates how to invokeCovidSim to use this data. See the  sample README fordetails on how to run the samples.\n    Given the entire Imperial College team is working full-time on the COVID-19 response, documentation is currently sparse. More documentation and sample files will be added as time permits. In the coming few weeks this will include a much more extensive set of input files to model strategies for exiting lockdown.\n  The following papers are relevant to the model.
