"note_en": "An Australian doctor says the coronavirus may affect a patient&#39;s blood system and could have caused strokes in a number of people aged in their 30s and 40s.\n Coronavirus may be increasing blood clotting in some patients, says Australian neurologist Dr Thomas Oxley\n Dr Oxley said Mount Sinai Hospital had seen five young coronavirus patients who had suffered a stroke\n Dr Thomas Oxley, interventional neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, said a small number of patients were &#34;having brain complications from the disease&#34;.\n &#34;We&#39;re seeing an increase in the number of strokes that are happening in our patients presenting to Mount Sinai Hospital,&#34; he told 7.30.\n &#34;What we are seeing is a disease that is partially working at least by increasing blood clotting in the body, and that is why we think there&#39;s increased risk of stroke occurring.&#34;\n He said while older coronavirus patients had also had strokes, in the last few weeks there had been a &#34;spike of young patients&#34;.\n  In a research paper due to be published next week by the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr Oxley and his colleagues said the hospital had seen five cases in people under the age of 50 in the last two weeks.\n  &#34;For comparison, our service, over the previous 12 months, has treated on average 0.73 patients every two weeks under the age of 50 years with large vessel stroke,&#34; the paper said.\n It went on to say &#34;the association between large vessel stroke and COVID-19 disease in young patients requires further investigation&#34;.\n &#34;It&#39;s certainly a small sample size and we are learning as we go,&#34; Dr Oxley told 7.30.\n &#34;We are hearing from our colleagues around the city that stroke numbers are up all around the city.\n &#34;It&#39;s still too early to know absolutely what the real numbers are going to be.&#34;\n The research paper said a report &#34;from the Wuhan COVID-19 outbreak showed a co-incident stroke rate of about 5 per cent in hospitalised patients; although the youngest patient in that series was 55 years old&#34;.\n The Washington Post reports that medical experts around the United States have recorded coronavirus patients experiencing blood clots.\n While research into COVID-19 is progressing rapidly, there is still a lot we do not know about the disease, which only emerged late last year.\n     &#34;We are talking about people at home with COVID-19, who may have mild symptoms of COVID-19, but are developing a sudden onset of large vessel stroke and then requiring to come into hospital as an emergency,&#34; he said.\n  The research paper said one of the patients was a previously healthy 33-year-old woman who developed a cough, headache and chills lasting one week. When she started showing stroke symptoms, she delayed seeking emergency care.\n &#34;Two of the patients in our cohort did not call the ambulance for 20 and 26 hours because they were afraid of coming into hospital, and because we&#39;ve been told that if you&#39;re sick at home, symptoms of fever and shortness of breath are the ones you might call the ambulance for.&#34;\n He said anyone who develops the symptoms of stroke \u2014 &#34;facial droop, arm weakness, speech disturbance&#34; \u2014 should call an ambulance immediately.\n  Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:42:40", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u5bfc\u81f4,blood", "title":

"note_en": "As of April 29th 2020, there were over  3.13 million confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) globally, with the United States, Spain, and Italy having the highest numbers. This number is most likely an undercount of all cases because the way a country tests for coronavirus can have a huge impact\u00a0on the number of cases they detect. We explore\u00a0how different testing approaches can dramatically limit countries\u2019 abilities to flatten the curve of infections.\n Statistics on the number of cases are difficult to compare across countries. Countries have vastly different approaches to testing their populations. For example, Iceland has the highest ratio of number of tests to population and has routinely tested persons with no symptoms or no evident contacts with infected persons. Nearly 44 tests per 1000 Icelanders were administered in the first 30 days of their coronavirus outbreak. In contrast, the US only tests some of the people with symptoms,  ...\n  Countries that fail to test a large or representative portion of their population might face severe adverse effects.   The case of Bergamo in Italy is a case in point. [1] As the virus circulated undetected for weeks, when the number of acute cases and deaths started to increase rapidly in March 2020 it quickly overwhelmed the capacity of local hospitals and funeral homes.\n Decisions on testing are essential to flatten the curve of infections. Comparing the town of Vo \u2019, Italy and the Diamond Princess cruise ship provides a natural experiment to understand the consequences of different testing decisions. Both places had a population of between 3,000 and 4,000 people and implemented similar isolation policies during the epidemic. However, the town of Vo \u2019tested almost all of its residents following the first detected case while the Diamond Princess ship initially  ...\n  By the final round of tests (two weeks since the first test), Vo \u2019had 6 people infected (0.2% of the population) and 2 deaths. In contrast, the Diamond Princess had 712 passengers infected (19.2% of the population) and 7 deaths. By testing only suspicious cases during the very first round of tests, the Diamond Princess had missed many infected people who then contributed to spread the virus in the subsequent period. The main difference between the two cases is the number of tests during  ...\n There is a strong relationship between the number of tests performed and the number of cases identified across countries (see diagram below). There is also evidence that the statistics emerging on Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Dead people (SIRD) from tests are not representative of the underlying populations ( http://lapogianni.blogspot.com/). This justifies the repeated calls by policy makers for \u201ctesting, testing, testing \u201d.
