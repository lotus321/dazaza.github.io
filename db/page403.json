"note_en": "We have contacted Nir Erez, the founder and CEO of Moovit, as well as Intel spokespeople for a comment on the reports and will update this story as we learn more. For now, Moovit\u2019s spokesperson has not denied the reports and what we have been told directly.\n \u201cAt this time we have no comment, but if anything changes I\u2019ll definitely let you know,\u201d Moovit\u2019s spokesperson.\n  Sources tell TechCrunch that the startup \u2014 which had previously been backed by Intel Capital in a  strategic investment \u2014 will become part of Intel\u2019s Israeli automotive hub, which is anchored by Mobileye, the autonomous driving company that  Intel acquired for $15.3 billion in 2017.\n It\u2019s not clear yet what Moovit would be doing in that hub, but as a rule, ingesting and actioning reliable, real-time traffic data and intelligent routing \u2014 the crux of what Moovit does \u2014 are some of the most challenging aspects of getting autonomous vehicle services up and running.\n And in fact, Moovit had already been working with Mobileye and Intel: the latter led Moovit\u2019s last round of funding, a  Series D of $50 million in 2018, and as part of that, Professor Amnon Shashua, Senior Vice President of Intel and CEO / CTO of Mobileye, joined\u00a0 Moovit\u2019s Board of Directors as an observer.\n Bringing on talent and integrating it into Intel\u2019s bigger strategy appears to be a big part of the deal. Of the $1 billion, employees will get about 10% of the final amount as part of a retention package, a detail both reported by Israeli Hebrew-language newspaper  The Marker and passed to us by David Bedussa, an analyst with Wadi Ventures.\n At the time of Moovit\u2019s last funding round, the startup was valued at over $500 million, but it has grown a lot in the last two years.\n It produces a popular, standalone app that people use to figure out the best way to navigate around cities, and it also integrates with the  likes of Uber in its efforts to provide multi-modal routes using different forms of transportation from Uber cars and bikes to using public transport and walking.\n In 2018, Moovit said its\u00a0 iOS,  Android and\u00a0 Web\u00a0apps were used by 120 million people globally across 2,000 cities in 80 countries. Now in 2020, that figure is over \u00a0800 million riders across 3,100 cities in 102 countries and 45 languages.\n Other investors in Moovit in addition to Intel include BMW, Sound Ventures, Gemini Israel, Sequoia Israel and LVMH.\n The acquisition (if it goes through, but also the M&amp;A interest) comes at a critical moment in the world of transportation. Currently, many people around the world are being asked to curtail their movement to slow down the spread of COVID-19 cases in what has become a global pandemic; and partly as a result of that same public health crisis, the global economy has been in a major downswing. Both have had a direct impact on the automotive world, which is seeing a slowdown in production  ...\n At the same time, those in the world of tech have been working on leveraging their assets in as optimised a way as possible to help keep things moving (so to speak).\n So, while consumer usage of Moovit\u2019s app will have drastically dropped off with people moving around less, the company has  launched a series of COVID-19 services to help those that still need to keep things operational, and still need to get from A to B.\n These have included a special service for transit data managers (which it\u2019s offering for free, unlike its normal B2B products) to both receive updated transit and traffic data and subsequently put in place \u201c thousands of \u00a0short-term changes quickly, enabling riders to plan their trips with only updated, valid routes.\u201d\n It has also started a real-time service for Moovit app users to make sure that they are getting those alerts. Thirdly, it has launched an \u201cemergency\u00a0mobilisation \u00a0on-demand\u201d service that lets transportation managers redeploy buses on routes more quickly to better serve essential workers that are still using public transport.\n It\u2019s not clear if Moovit had been working on raising more money, or if it had been feeling the same pinch that so many other startups have felt when it comes to closing deals, or if this was just an offer too good to refuse, or even if it was on the table before COVID-19. Given Moovit\u2019s existing size and scope, it\u2019s a business that looks like it will be worth running for some time to come.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 01:31:52", "tags":

"note_en": "Lindsay M. Chervinsky, Ph.D., is a historian at the  White House Historical Association. Her book,   The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution will be published by Harvard University Press on April 7, 2020. Follow her on Twitter:  @lmchervinsky.\n  I \u2019ve always been fascinated by how individuals can influence policy, government, and events. At no time did a small group of people have more power over the development of government and events than in the 1790s when there were five people in the cabinet. Sure there are plenty of books on Jefferson, Hamilton, and their tempestuous relationship, but I wanted to know where the institution came from. It \u2019s not in the Constitution, no additional legislation created the body, and everything I read  ...\n When I decided to tackle this question, I spent some time exploring the governors \u2019councils in the state governments, the British cabinet, and the councils of war in the Continental Army during the Revolution. But there was no avoiding that I really had to get into the minds of Washington and the department secretaries in order to understand their interactions and the development of the institution. While I didn \u2019t really realize it at the time (after all, writing a dissertation and then your  ...\n One: I read a ton of biographies. I wanted to know what other authors had written about their personalities, what evidence they were using to back up their arguments, and how these books were similar or different. Plus, when I actually started digging into the archival material, I already had a sense of the narrative arc and that really helped me keep my facts straight.\n Two: I searched the letters of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, and President George Washington to find any mention of a cabinet meeting. I quickly learned that Washington refused to use the word cabinet during his presidency and instead referred to them as \u201cthe gentlemen of my family\u201d or \u201cthe secretaries.\u201d By documenting when the cabinet met, I could determine patterns, moments of crisis, and when gatherings subsided.\n Three: I tracked down remaining letters from the other secretaries to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing any meetings on my master list.\n Four: I dug into the correspondence and notes to try and get a sense of the  character of the meetings. Thankfully, Hamilton and Jefferson kept copious notes about the cabinet meetings and Washington \u2019s letters sometimes hint at discomfort or unpleasantness. For example, Washington would sometimes invite the secretaries to join him for a family dinner after a meeting. He didn \u2019t say why, but we know it wasn \u2019t because Hamilton and Jefferson were the best of pals. I began to hypothesize  ...\n  One really important part of this process was comparing the notes. Hamilton would often write a quick outline of the meeting \u2019s progress and then include notes about what he wanted to say or the speech he wanted to give. In Jefferson \u2019s notes, however, he would write, \u201cHamilton made a jury speech of three-quarters of an hour, as inflammatory and declamatory as if he had been speaking to a jury. \u201dThe next day, Jefferson picked up where he left off: \u201cMet again. Hamilton spoke again three-quarters  ...\n Five: Once I started to speculate about how they might have felt about each other, the room where they were meeting, and more, I explored social customs and conventions at the time. I looked into how they dressed, how they might have postured themselves, expectations of privacy, etc. I \u2019m a big believer that you should start a new project exploring the historiography, but then you often have to return to it again once you have your evidence and further consider how the little details  ...\n Six: I \u2019ve made this process sound super mathematical until this point, and it \u2019s true that I tried to be really methodical about my approach to finding and documenting cabinet meetings. But history isn \u2019t math and there isn \u2019t always an equation. I found that I got to a point where I felt like I knew them. I trusted myself to fill in some of the fuzzy details. I try and be very clear about what I know for sure based on evidence and what I don \u2019t, but I \u2019m not afraid to share what I  ...\n I took this leap of faith when writing about Secretary of State Edmund Randolph \u2019s resignation after the other secretaries had accused him of selling state secrets to France. Their correspondence is fairly well documented and Randolph wrote a pamphlet defending his actions, but none of the players ever wrote about their emotions. Leaning on what I knew about honor culture (mostly from Joanne Freeman), Washington \u2019s sensitivity to scandal and desire to retire, and the written material,  ...\n By the time I wrote the section about Randolph, which was one of the final parts of the book, I felt I had mastered the material as much as one can ever really understand events that came before our time. It was exciting and important to me that I share that knowledge with others. It might have been easier to just say \u201chere \u2019s what happened, here \u2019s what they wrote. \u201dBut I think that \u2019s far less interesting and tells an incomplete story. The whole point of writing a book is to share  ...\n [1] Thomas Jefferson,  The Complete Anas of Thomas Jefferson, ed. Franklin B. Sawvel.

"note_en": "As we continue to stay physically distant from one another, it can be hard to feel socially present with the tools we have. Even with  Zoom and other more  casual chat apps, video chat can feel sort of flat. (And for those of us lucky enough to be working from home, visiting friends after work with the same tools we use to  do work stuffdoesn \u2019t always feel great.) More often than not, we sit, stationary at our designated video-chat-spot, trade reports from self-quarantine and maybe drag in a cat  ...\n But even untethered from our desks with more playful video chat apps or innovations like Facebook\u2019s Portal and its roving eye, there\u2019s still something  else that doesn\u2019t get conveyed. With flat screens, we have little sense of our physical selves in relation to one another. Socializing spatially, as it turns out, is something we probably took for granted. But the gaming world has understood this for years.\n  Now more than ever, we need creative ways to feel present with other people. The whole crisis looks like a huge opportunity for the gaming industry, but also one for more transcendent digital social experiences that don\u2019t just look like playing a few rounds of Call of Duty after work. Hopefully, these experiences could be so imaginative that we don\u2019t even know what they could look like yet.\n If VR had delivered on its early promise, we\u2019d all probably be  living in it right now. The idea of having some kind of shared virtual realm is still a potent one, but the additional hardware has proven too prohibitive to get the average person on board (for now, at least) and even the coolest VR experiences remain niche. Still, it\u2019s clear that we want to come together, not just in Instagram DMs and email threads, but as avatars navigating shared spaces. Somehow.\n   If the mainstream crossover success of Animal Crossing is any indication, people have a huge appetite for virtual spaces right now. Even with Nintendo\u2019s truly painful online multiplayer experience, there\u2019s something fun and special about visiting a friend, bopping each other with nets and showing them your new digs.\n In Animal Crossing, this is truly a more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts experience. The last time I genuinely laughed and  could not stopwas visiting my younger sister \u2019s Animal Crossing island right after the game launched. In spite of the interface \u2019s few emotes and harsh character limits, her weird sense of humor managed to bubble up through the game \u2019s limitations. And those constraints made it more special, for some reason. When I left her island I felt a pang of sadness at leaving her funny  ...\n These experiences are happening on an individual level, but also a collective one\u2014and people are getting creative. One of the writers from Rogue One just made his own  in-game Animal Crossing talkshow, complete with its own tiny guest couch and cityscape view.\n  A developer in New York even launched a dev conference that took place entirely on an Animal Crossing island. Much like a normal conference, \u201c Deserted Island DevOps\u201d boasted speakers, moderators and even talks to be uploaded to YouTube after the fact.\n Plenty of players are using Animal Crossing for more intimate get-togethers too, like celebrating  Ramadan and  Passover last month or just gathering far-flung friends or family together in one place.\n Thanks to everyone who came out to yet another  @animalcrossing Suhoor. It was super lovely to talk to and meet all of you from all around the world &lt;3  pic.twitter.com/G9a8SNTFe0\n  The pandemic is showing us that the sweet spot of mainstream virtual presence might be something more than a Zoom-like video conference but less than a full-on virtual reality experience. Video games, or more specifically video games as  platforms, seem to be resonating right now, even among the kinds of people who wouldn\u2019t identify as gamers. That last bit is important.\n This is something that Fortnite maker Epic Games has been doing right for a while now. There\u2019s a reason that Fortnite, like Animal Crossing, brought non-gamers into the fold. Sure, Fortnite is fun and addictive, but lots of games are fun and addictive\u2014and Fortnite is much harder than a lot of those games.\n Epic\u2019s real innovation is its buttery-smooth social layer that seamlessly connects players across platforms. If you can talk a friend into downloading an app, you\u2019re in business. Of course, other games get this right too (Minecraft comes to mind, of course, and others) but timing is everything right now. And Fortnite\u2019s team is cleverly iterating on its already-good ideas.\n  This week, Epic added a new deliberately chill game mode called Party Royale to Fortnite \u2014a new island just for hanging out with friends. Littered with appropriately zany non-lethal weapons like throwable hamburgers and paintball guns, Party Royale is a designated space where you can take a group and chat while doing mindless yet amusing nonsense, like awkwardly kicking a soccer ball around (I did this with a total stranger for 20 minutes for some reason!) or driving virtual ATVs  ...\n And like much of Epic \u2019s battle royale hit, the island itself is over-the-top weird, stocked with everything from a pirate ship to a music festival grounds awash in colorful lights, gigantic neon dancers and a very psychedelic vibe, molly not included. There \u2019s even a drive-in movie screen, like another area of the main game, which could signal interesting things to come. If we \u2019re lucky and Epic expands it out, Fortnite \u2019s newest casual online virtual space could evolve into something  ...\n Fortnite is a game ostensibly about killing people before they kill you, but it\u2019s also a concert venue\u2014and that hints at Epic\u2019s deeper ideas about the game as a versatile social platform. The game held its latest big in-game show event last month, this time featuring a skyscraper-height Travis Scott who performed as he stormed around a bucolic-turned-kaleidoscopic version of the Fortnite map.  12 million people tuned in, besting the 10 million who played during the more modest  Marshmello  ...\n   For anyone who\u2019s spent any time in massively multiplayer online role-playing games ( MMORPGs), this will all sound familiar. These games have long, vibrant history of drawing huge numbers of people together into persistent shared virtual spaces and letting them express themselves. Curating outfits, decorating spaces and even making choices around playstyle and faction affiliation are all ways to express aspects of who you are and what you \u2019re about in a virtual world populated by  ...\n During its  peak ten years ago, World of Warcraft had as many active subscribers as players who tuned into the Travis Scott event\u201412 million. Since then, gaming exploded into the mainstream and by late 2018, Fortnite boasted almost  80 million active players. Online multiplayer itself bounded forward too, mostly through the success of blockbuster first-person shooters \u2014usually grim, well-funded and vaguely or overtly militaristic games that routinely court one kind of gamer. Playful,  ...\n The wild popularity of  Minecraft carved out a path for cooperative gaming not just because building stuff is incredibly fun, though that\u2019s true too, but because doing anything new with friends in a virtual space is really cool. Scrappier games like the incredible  No Man\u2019s Skycould do for exploration what Minecraft did for building, but with an indie developer \u2019s budget, big ideas about multiplayer play can only get so far. Historically, the lion \u2019s share of industry resources  ...\n There\u2019s a big opportunity right now for games offering a common social experience that\u2019s magnetic enough to draw in the kind of people who don\u2019t even play games. For those of us stuck at home, imaginative gaming worlds offer not just their usual escape from the moment\u2019s stresses, but a way to share space when we can\u2019t come together.", "posttime":

These types of articles to me are more important than overly technical ones. Being a good programmer isn&#39;t just about your technical knowledge. This article is a must read this month to understand some of the biases we have as programmers. Knowing that they exist will help you notice them in the future... hopefully.\n   Can you make a youtube video with a dynamic title? That is, a title that is constantly changing based on the number of views?

It can be used both with interactive whiteboards or in a dual-screen setup with a pen-tablet display and a beamer.\n  OpenBoard was originally forked from Open-Sankor\u00e9 2.0, which was itself based on Uniboard. This fork was created to refocus the software on its original core functionalities and values, that is the work of a teacher in a classroom, privileging the ease of use. The evolution of this software will therefore take place in accordance with these core principles.\n    Currently, OpenBoard is maintained by the Education Department (DIP) of the canton of Geneva, in Switzerland. The University of Lausanne, who developped the original Uniboard software in 2003 has joined the effort by means of a logistical and financial contribution. An association project will be developed in 2019.\n A meeting was held in June 2016 between representatives from the universities of Lausanne, Neuch\u00e2tel, Fribourg and Geneva, the departments of Education from the cantons of Geneva and Jura as well as various institutions from the canton of Vaud (Switzerland) to together reflect on the desired evolution of OpenBoard.\n  Interest is growing fast across Switzerland but also in Europe and North America. A swiss law non-profit organisation should be created. This organisation would promote OpenBoard and its open source development and foster collaboration between interested parties. This in respect of the core principles which led to the creation of this fork, that is the refocusing on the work of a teacher in a classroom, privileging the ease of use.", "posttime": "2020-05-04

"note_en": "As volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occasionally remind us, the earth beneath our feet is constantly on the move.\n Continental plates only move around 1-4 inches per year, so we don\u2019t notice the tectonic forces that are continually reshaping the surface of our planet. But on a long enough timeline, those inches add up to big changes in the way landmasses on Earth are configured.\n Today\u2019s map, by  Massimo Pietrobon, is a look back to when all land on the planet was arranged into a supercontinent called Pangea. Pietrobon\u2019s map is unique in that it overlays the approximate borders of present day countries to help us understand how Pangea broke apart to form the world that we know today.\n   Pangea began developing over 300 million years ago, eventually making up one-third of the earth\u2019s surface. The remainder of the planet was an enormous ocean known as Panthalassa.\n As time goes by, scientists are beginning to piece together more information on the climate and patterns of life on the supercontinent. Similar to parts of Central Asia today, the center of the landmass is thought to have been arid and inhospitable, with temperatures reaching 113\u00baF (45\u00baC). The extreme temperatures revealed by  climate simulationsare supported by the fact that very few fossils are found in the modern day regions that once existed in the middle of Pangea. The strong contrast between  ...\n By this unique point in history, plants and animals had spread across the landmass, and animals (such as dinosaurs) were able to wander freely across the entire expanse of Pangea.\n  Around 200 million years ago, magma began to swell up through a weakness in the earth\u2019s crust, creating the volcanic rift zone that would eventually cleave the supercontinent into pieces. Over time, this rift zone would become the Atlantic Ocean. The most visible evidence of this split is in the similar shape of the coastlines of modern-day Brazil and West Africa.\n Present-day North America broke away from Europe and Africa, and as the map highlights, Atlantic Canada was once connected to Spain and Morocco.\n The concept of plate tectonics is behind some of modern Earth\u2019s most striking features. The Himalayas, for example, were formed after the Indian subcontinent broke off the eastern side of Africa and crashed directly into Asia. Many of the  world\u2019s tallest mountains were formed by this process of plate convergence \u2013 a process that, as far as we know, is unique to Earth.\n  Since the average continent is only moving about 1 foot (0.3m) every decade, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll ever be alive to see an epic geographical revision to the world map.\n However, for whatever life exists on Earth roughly 300 million years in the future, they may have front row seats in seeing the emergence of a new supercontinent: Pangea Proxima.\n  As the above  video from the Paleomap Project shows, Pangea Proxima is just one possible supercontinent configuration that occurs in which Australia slams into Indonesia, and North and South America crash into Africa and Antarctica, respectively.\n Interestingly, Pangea Proxima could have a massive inland sea, mainly made up of what is the Indian Ocean today. Meanwhile, the other oceans would combine into one superocean that would take up the majority of the Earth\u2019s surface.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 00:25:14", "tags":

worth north of $4 billion dollars, included positions in United, American, Southwest and Delta Airlines.\n &#34;The world has changed for the airlines. And I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way,&#34; he said.\n Buffett said he admires the airlines, but that sometimes there are events like the coronavirus &#34;on the lower levels of probabilities&#34; that necessitate a quick change.\n He added: &#34;When we sell something, very often it&#39;s going to be our entire stake: We don&#39;t trim positions.&#34;\n Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and billionaire value investor  Warren Buffett said that the conglomerate has sold the entirety of its equity position in the U.S. airline industry. The prior stake, worth north of $4 billion dollars in December, included  positions in United,  American,  Southwest and  Delta Airlines.\n  &#34;The world has changed for the airlines. And I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way,&#34; he said during Berkshire&#39;s annual shareholder meeting Saturday, which was virtual this year. &#34;I don&#39;t know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.&#34;\n But &#34;I think there are certain industries, and unfortunately, I think that the airline industry, among others, that are really hurt by a forced shutdown by events that are far beyond our control,&#34; he added.\n Demand for air travel has plunged since March as the virus and precautions like shelter-in-place orders keep potential passengers home.\u00a0Asked by CNBC&#39;s  Becky Quick to clarify if Berkshire had sold  all of its airline holdings, Buffett answered &#34;yes.&#34;\n He explained: &#34;When we sell something, very often it&#39;s going to be our entire stake: We don&#39;t trim positions. That&#39;s just not the way we approach it any more than if we buy 100% of a business. We&#39;re going to sell it down to 90% or 80%.&#34;\n &#34;If we like a business, we&#39;re going to buy as much of it as we can and keep it as long as we can,&#34; he added. &#34;And when we change our mind we don&#39;t take half measures.&#34;\n  Buffett reiterated that he admires the airlines and their management teams, but that sometimes there are events  like the coronavirus calamity &#34;on the lower levels of probabilities that happen&#34; that necessitate a quick change to an investment.\n As of December, Berkshire owned 42.5 million (10% stake) American shares, 58.9 million (9.2% stake) Delta shares, 51.3 million (10.1% stake) Southwest shares and 21.9 million (7.6% stake) United shares. The stocks are down 62.9%, 58.7%, 45.8% and 69.7%, respectively, in 2020.\n  His comments Saturday afternoon from Omaha came after  Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter earnings that showed Buffett and his lieutenants built up the conglomerate&#39;s cash stockpile and only nibbled at equities during the violent stock market rout in March.\n In 2016, Berkshire revealed a surprise bet on the sector that Buffett had before shunned. But years of consolidation through post-bankruptcy mega-mergers and a decline in fuel prices have helped airlines rake in record profits.\n Airlines posted their 10th straight year of profits in 2019 and were preparing for even more growth in travel demand early this year, just when coronavirus started to spread.\u00a0The four airlines Berkshire sold out of are scrambling to save cash, slashing routes, parking hundreds of planes and urging employees to take unpaid and partial leave.\n The so-called &#34;Oracle of Omaha&#34; had alluded to the airline sale earlier in Saturday&#39;s meeting, when he said he&#39;d made\u00a0an &#34;understandable mistake&#34; when valuing the airline stocks as a near-global halt in travel due to the coronavirus sent their prices sharply lower.\n &#34;When we bought [airlines], we were getting an attractive amount for our money when investing across the airlines,&#34; he said. &#34;It turned out I was wrong about that business because of something that was not in any way the fault of four excellent CEOs. Believe me. No joy of being a CEO of an airline.&#34;\n &#34;I don&#39;t know that three, four years from now people will fly as many passenger miles as they did last year,&#34; he said. &#34;You&#39;ve got too many planes.&#34;\n Airline executives have called the pandemic the industry&#39;s worst-ever crisis and expect the impact to take several years to recover from. Last month, American, United, Southwest and Delta reported their first losses in years. U.S. travel demand is down 95% on the year.\n Prior to 2016, Buffett had eschewed airline investments and had been so opposed to putting money into the industry in the past that he told shareholders in a 2007 note that &#34;if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.&#34;\n U.S. airlines last month started receiving portions of $25 billion in federal grants and loans that require them not to lay off or cut pay rates of workers through Sept. 30. Major airline executives this week warned they will have to shrink to manage through the crisis.\n Subscribe   to CNBC PRO  for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from

"note_en": "Itch.io hosts web games / apps by embedding them within an iframe. While this doesn&#39;t affect Strike&#39;s functionality for the most part, I&#39;m not sure if all browsers / devices support file loading and saving from within the iframe. The standalone version is provided in case there are some features that the iframe can&#39;t support.\n      16-&#39;color&#39; palette via dither patterns. Each pattern is treated as a separate color for fill tool\n     save images as a 16-color greyscale (which will import back into Strike with all patterns intact), or as 1-bit black and white image\n  Strike is supported on mobile devices and tablets; I personally use it with an iPad Pro.\n    Strike is not meant to be a full-featured paint app, so has quite a few limitations.\n  Undo / redo may slow down for large strokes or complex drawings. If they behave strangely, please file a bug report.\n There is a limited autosave feature; by default, starting up Strike will load up the previously drawn image. Creating a new canvas will erase the autosave. You can disable autosaves via the settings (gear) menu. Strike only autosaves one image at a time, so please regularly export your work.\n    Strike has been tested on up-to-date Firefox, Chrome, Microsoft Edge (the Chromium-based one), and Safari (both desktop and iOS). Do note that with Safari, the app may behave weirdly on versions pre-13.0 (as I\u00a0was not able to test on anything earlier).\n    The program is written in JS without any build tools. Source code can be found at\u00a0 https://github.com/dmliao/strike.\n   Just for your info, there is a small bug with the brush\u00a0when you increase its size and then decrease again.\n Nice work! One tiny, tiny suggestion: for the very first use of the tool, it might be worth defaulting the brush size to something larger than 1, because a 1-pixel-sized brush doesn&#39;t really show off the patterns much. A small thing, but might make it fractionally easier to grasp.\n Really nice controls! It would be cool to have an opacity option too (e.g. all black on all white at 50% opacity would result in the middle dot pattern)\n love love love this! any plans for key mapping some of the controls? esp. the brush size and stuff? really nice!", "posttime": "2020-05-04 00:03:04", "tags": "\u7ed8\u753b,web,strike", "title":

"note_en": "In December 2017,  two  videos emerged that showed Navy pilots encountering mysterious spherical objects that appeared, at first glance, to move through the air in ways that baffled experts. A third, released in March 2018, depicted a similar encounter.\n Everyone who watched \u2014 including the pilots who filmed them \u2014 had the same question: What, exactly, are these things?\n Last week, a Navy official publicly called these mysterious objects \u201cUnidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP),\u201d giving name to the inscrutable little dots and reigniting scrutiny around the unidentified flying objects (a term the Navy does not want to use even though the objects that are flying cannot be identified.)\n   \u201cThe Navy designates the objects contained in these videos as unidentified aerial phenomena,\u201d Joseph Gradisher, spokesman for the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare,  told the Black Vault blog, a  massive civilian repository of government documents mostly obtained by Freedom of Information Act requests.\n  Gradisher further explained that \u201cThe \u2018Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\u2019 terminology is used because it provides the basic descriptor for the sightings/observations of unauthorized/unidentified aircraft/objects that have been observed entering/operating in the airspace of various military-controlled training ranges.\u201d\n Black Vault\u2019s founder, John Greenewald Jr., told The Washington Post that he believed the remarks were significant because, for the first time, the Navy acknowledged the existence of the objects in the videos on the record and admitted that the department cannot identify them. Greenewald also reported that the videos were not originally intended for public release.\n  Because of this revelation, Gradisher\u2019s comments to Black Vault have ricocheted across the Internet this week, getting picked up everywhere from Popular Mechanics (\u201c The Navy Says Those UFO Videos Are Real\u201d) to the front page of the Drudge Report (\u201c UPDATE: Navy says It\u2019s Tracking UFOs \u2026\u201d).\n  \u201cThe most powerful military doesn\u2019t know what these objects are,\u201d Greenewald said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean aliens, or that they don\u2019t have some plausible logical explanation. But \u2026 admitting that they see things in the sky and they can\u2019t identify them, that to me is the most amazing part of this.\u201d\n  In a subsequent interview with The Post, Gradisher downplayed the significance of the moniker, saying that \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d was not a new term and that the Navy preferred it to the more popular \u201cUFO\u201d because the latter comes with cultural stigma that might discourage pilots from reporting such incidents for fear of being labeled, well, kooky.\n  This year,  the Navy overhauled its guidelines for reporting these UAPs to encourage pilots to flag disturbances, which have been occurring regularly since 2014. Gradisher said one possible explanation could be the rise of unmanned aerial systems (or UAS, if you can handle another abbreviation) such as quadrocopters, a kind of drone easily available to the public.\n  \u201cAll of this is about incursions into our training ranges by what we\u2019re calling UAPs,\u201d he said. \u201cThese incursions cause a hazard to the safety of our aviators and the security of our operators, and that\u2019s what the Navy\u2019s investigating, these range incursions.\u201d\n \u201cThese three videos that are out there \u2026 reflect three reports of incursions into our training ranges\u201d that occurred in 2004 and 2015, he said.\n   The three videos, titled \u201c FLIR1,\u201d \u201c Gimbal\u201d and \u201c GoFast,\u201d were initially released by the  New York Times and an organization called To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science, which \u201cengages with global citizens to investigate the outer edges of science and unconventional thinking\u201d and was  founded by a former member of Blink 182.\n That the eerie footage had emerged along with revelations about  a secret and since-shelved Pentagon division known as the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program did not exactly staunch speculation that a less-earthly culprit was to blame for these \u201cincursions.\u201d On YouTube, the footage has been watched millions of times.\n  Black Vault\u2019s founder, Greenewald, would not speculate whether Gradisher\u2019s comments were further proof of extraterrestrial life, saying he prefers to stick to what the documents he\u2019s obtained via FOIA requests tell him. But the subject of UAPs, or UFOs, or whatever we\u2019re calling them, continues to fascinate him.\n  The truth is still out there, and for Greenewald, there was only one way to find it: \u201cWe just have to keep asking those questions.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-03 23:17:55", "tags": "\u6d77\u519b,admits,navy", "title":

"note_en": "I\u2019ve sat back and witnessed the development of Windows 10 and appreciated the speed of new feature releases, but it seems there\u2019s a price to pay for this new \u201cWindows as a service\u201d world. Microsoft has gradually been infesting Windows 10 with annoying ads. The first emerged on the lock screen as \u201ctips,\u201d and then there was the  bundling of  Candy Crush with the OS, and now Microsoft has started blasting notifications into the task bar and File Explorer.\n Windows 10 users have been complaining vocally in recent weeks about  OneDrive notifications in the File Explorer, encouraging them to pay $6.99 for an Office 365 subscription. The task bar notifications that prompt people to switch to Edge when they use Chrome, or install Microsoft\u2019s Personal Shopping Assistant for Chrome, have been appearing for months. Microsoft even decided to use notifications to  warn Chrome usersabout battery drain. These types of notifications not only spoil the experience  ...\n These Edge notifications are all over the place now. Never seen this one before  pic.twitter.com/4gsoxEYgHk\n\u2014 Tom Warren (@tomwarren)  October 31, 2016\n  Now Microsoft is planning to preload another app in Windows 10: Sling TV. While only US Windows 10 users  will get Sling TV preloaded without the necessary subscription, it will sit alongside  Candy Crushand Solitaire as other examples of what will soon be described as bloatware. Thankfully, it \u2019s easy to uninstall these unnecessary apps, but that doesn \u2019t mean Microsoft won \u2019t add more to the mix in the future. Microsoft used to blame its OEM partners for bundling lots of useless apps on Windows  ...\n   Some might argue that Microsoft is well within its rights as most people got Windows 10 free of charge. That\u2019s a valid argument for some, but most Windows users will have paid for a license for the OS through the purchase of a laptop or desktop PC. Placing notifications in the File Explorer and task bar \u2014 parts of the operating system that no other developers are allowed to touch \u2014 just feels really unnecessary and an abuse of power.\n Microsoft added a notification center to Windows 10 for a reason. If it feels the need to blast its loyal users with irritating prompts then these should be channeled into that notification center, not wedged into the File Explorer or on top of the task bar. You shouldn&#39;t have to dig deep into a  settings panel to disable these; they shouldn&#39;t be there in your File Explorer in the first place.

(That\u2019s 7 hours, if you\u2019re counting.)\n   She recalls the tiniest details ( remember the\u00a0time\u00a0you wanted to start an events company?) about my life.\n And even when things are awry at her start-up, she\u2019s\u00a0 lucid in her stress.\n I once Ingrid how she defined success. And without a hint of hesitation she said:\n     If\u00a0time\u00a0is the currency of achievement, why are some able to cash in their allocation for more chips than others?\n And in a world of rapid fire Slack messages, daily episodes of\u00a0 The Daily\u00a0and Zoom calls up the wazoo \u2013 who on earth has the right to \u00a0not feel rushed?\n Wait But Why\u2019s\u00a0Tim Urban offers a clue. As one of my blogging idols, Urban has the deft ability to crank out 10,000 word posts (like\u00a0 this one\u00a0on career change) that double as\u00a0free\u00a0life coaching sessions.\n   Digging into the mentions, it becomes quite clear why he\u00a0 just doesn\u2019t use Google Drive.\n  In the book\u00a0 No BS\u00a0Time\u00a0Management,\u00a0Dan Kennedy has an entire chapter dedicated to the evil forces that\u00a0 make us feel rushed all the dang\u00a0time.\u00a0Look no further than the name of chapter two itself:\n How to Drive a Stake Through the Hearts of the\u00a0Time\u00a0Vampires Out to Suck You Dry\n    There\u2019s one thing you\u2019ll never see in a casino.\u00a0 A clock.\u00a0And that\u2019s good business \u2013 if you\u2019re the dealer.\n   You actually do this already \u2013 the Peloton Leaderboard, a Headspace streak or the star chart that rewards your 6 year old\u2019s good behavior.\n   It\u2019s the\u00a0 Timular\u00a0Time\u00a0Tracker\u00a0and it lets you easily account for your\u00a0time\u00a0so that your days don\u2019t disappear like the clock-less casino.\n  When I first hired my business coach, he asked me for an audit of my\u00a0time.\n      In the $10 category there was the constant re-scheduling Zoom calls, formatting Keynotes, responding to YouTube comments, and gathering my 1099s.\n    But whether you\u2019re a business owner, executive or manager \u2013 there absolutely are daily actions that could have $10,000 outcomes in the future.\n   When you break the code of extremely successful people like Ingrid, you realize that they have an\u00a0 unwavering commitment\u00a0to $10,000/hr work.\n And it\u2019s not necessarily profit-driven \u2013 they\u2019re simply\u00a0 deliberate in playing the long game.\n   \u201cI arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.\u201d\n This succinctly captures the our daily tension as well-intentioned day spiral out of our control\u2026 minutes after our alarms go off.\n   Be perfectly present with your child or do a task that fattens their 529 plan?\n Should you give the hamster wheel another good twirl or pursue more purposeful work that energizes you?\n In the NYT article\u00a0 productivity isn\u2019t about\u00a0time\u00a0management, it\u2019s about attention management\u00a0Wharton Professor (and longtime RadReader) Adam Grant sheds some light into Ingrid\u2019s unique mindset:\n I\u2019ve found that productive people don\u2019t agonize about which desire to pursue. They go after both simultaneously, gravitating toward projects that are personally interesting and socially meaningful.\n Which brings me to a peculiar recent discovery of mine. This discovery touches three of my favorite activities: surfing, writing and meditation.\n      You may know it as Flow. Or the Zone. Rowers refer to it as\u00a0 swing:\n The swing carries us; We do not force it. We pump our legs to drive our arc higher, but gravity does most of the work. We are not so much swinging as being swung. The boat swings you. The shell wants to move fast: Speed sings in its lines and nature. Our job is simply to work with the shell, to stop holding it back with our thrashing struggles to go faster. Trying too hard sabotages boat speed.\n Ingrid\u2019s days are\u00a0 rich with swing.\u00a0She\u2019s found her\u00a0 Wu Wei\u00a0\u2013 and I\u2019m on the hunt for mine.\n Let\u2019s design a life system to find that Wu Wei \u2013 sign up for  Supercharge Your Productivity with Notion.

Siddhartha was the founding member of IIFL Wealth. Siddhartha has also worked with HSBC, Citibank &amp; UTI bank in wealth\u00a0management &amp; merchant banking roles. He writes about finance &amp; life and has authored a book \u2013 8 Minute Decision.\n    Covid-19 will change the way the world works; just like the Great Depression, dot-com bubble, and the 2008 financial crash did in the past. The question on everyone\u2019s mind is, \u2018Will things go back to normal?\u2019\n  I\u2019ve been pondering, like many have, what fundamental changes will take place in how people, businesses, and economies function. The next 12 months will be difficult. Many businesses will struggle, some may even die. But as with economic adversities of the past, new industries will emerge bringing with it renewed hope of recovery. Eventually, things will go back to normal. Just that we\u2019ll have to change the definition of normal.  Welcome to the  New Normal.\n    This  infographic on the history of pandemics is insightful and hence I won\u2019t touch upon it.\n  While Covid-19 may not have the scale of pandemics of the past (as of date), the economic damage has and will continue to affect more people than the disease itself.\n    Studying past trends of similar infections can help in drawing inferences as to what might help us going forward. What would it take to see this pandemic through?\n    There\u2019s a high likelihood we\u2019re 12 months away from a semblance of normalcy. The biggest worry is a mutating virus that brings wave upon wave of attacks, each deadlier than the other. During the course of time that Covid-19 lasts, businesses and the global economy will continue to be significantly impacted.\n    It might be a mouthful but here \u2019s a look at what \u2019s to come in the immediate future. Liquidity is expected to remain tight as the cost of borrowing in real terms will jump upwards. This is despite central banks \u2019efforts to reduce interest rates. Banks and financial institutions will be under immense pressure as the fear of NPAs, insolvency and bankruptcies increase multifold. The government will focus on meeting hyper demand for essential goods while non-essential businesses  ...\n    I don\u2019t want to sound like a pessimist \u2013 the road forward looks rough. While there are sectors and businesses that will benefit, the prognosis is rather grim. In my best guess, here are some of the sectors that will be adversely affected and others that will see an uptick.\n    Apparel &amp; Textile will get hit adversely due to disruption in labour supply, raw material unavailability, working capital constraints and restricted demand due to limited movement of people and purchasing ability.\n  Auto sector (which includes automobiles and auto parts) will continue to face challenges on account of lack of demand, global recession and falling income levels.\n  Aviation &amp; Tourism is one sector which has the highest probability of going under without direct government intervention. In the next 12 months, it\u2019s highly unlikely people will travel for leisure apart from very essential travel.\n  Shipping and Non-Food Retail \u2013 Non food retail chains and global shipping businesses will find this 12 month period very challenging.\n  Building &amp; Construction businesses are generally leveraged and hence will face the dual challenges of high-interest payments and lack of sales.\n      Broadly, anything which involves personal interaction will face problems in the next 12 months \u2013 real estate or big-ticket items/luxury products.\n    Digital &amp; Internet Economy: Online based products &amp; services companies will find new takers\r There will be a sudden spike in the demand for Content, with digital content being in demand more than ever.\n  FMCG &amp; Retail will benefit immensely. With continued fear, food-based retail chains, and companies catering to low-ticket consumption demand will emerge as winners.\n  Speciality Chemicals: Firms dealing in Chemicals will see a jump due to increased demand for disinfectants, drugs and medicines.\n    The smallcases in the chart are  Specialty Chemicals,  Pharma Tracker and  FMCG Tracker.  A  smallcase is a basket of stocks/ETFs based on ideas, themes and strategies. They are professionally managed and offer investors more transparency and control over their investments.\n    Predictions. Anyone can do it, everyone does. It doesn\u2019t cost anything and does no harm. Not in my line of work.\n  As an investment professional, I\u2019m responsible for the management of over $250+ million in client money. My job is to make bold predictions and then take calculated risks with the objective of growing my clients\u2019 capital. Like everyone else with an opinion, here are some of my thoughts on the  New Normal for Business.\n  But before that, a disclaimer. I\u2019m not a crystal-ball gazer and have no powers beyond my understanding of macro trends and financial markets. Take this with a pinch of salt. Here goes.\n    \u2018Sh*t hits the fan so that fertilizer can rain\u2019. I don\u2019t think Jackie Viramontez, an obscure relationship \u2018expert\u2019 &amp; author, was thinking about global upheaval when she wrote those words. But relationships do have something in common with the current situation \u2013 heartbreak.\n  Many lives will be lost and millions more affected. Countries will introspect, businesses will realign. But as Jackie\u2019s 21st-century take on turning lemons into lemonade goes, there may be a silver lining. We may have to wait for the rain clouds to depart.\n    Having seen off the worst of the coronavirus wrath, China is limping back to normal. They will continue to remain a dominant exporter of raw material as well as finished goods, but businesses will ensure dependency on China\u00a0is reduced. With all the talk of this being China\u2019s moment, will they be able to capitalize?\n    Technology for many businesses, until today, was considered to be a support function with it being used as a means to get to an end. This is set to change as technology will now become the frontline requirement in most organizations. Its importance will be comparable to that of revenue-generating functions \u2013 sales and business development.\n  Trends will accelerate. Automation will gain momentum as the spend on sophisticated IT infrastructure outpaces human resources. Job creation will be limited with more offers being rolled out on a contractual basis than on a full-time basis. This sort of gig economy will emerge in the emerging markets as well as the more developed markets. Work from home will be the new normal. Firms in some sectors will realise that employees working from  ...\n    Non-environment friendly businesses will be looked down upon in terms of business valuations and focus on ESG (environmental, social, governance) will be a new way forward. Cities have already started thinking about  sustainable development models. New, more compact and agile value chains will emerge, as non-essential intermediaries are given a back seat. This will also drive employee/labour productivity and efficiency.\n    Businesses will rethink their strategy of focusing on sales without profitability/profitability growth. Organizations claiming hefty valuations just on the basis of sales growth will no longer\u00a0find buyers \u2013 focus on profit and profit growth will be the new normal.\n    That is, as long as the price of oil doesn\u2019t drop to $0 again. (FYI, only the expiring futures contract dropped to zero)\n  Data will become even more valuable, and with it, data misuse through AI will also become rampant. We\u2019re already seeing governments and private entities roll out contact tracing tools which have poor implementation and pose severe threats to data security and privacy. As these entities have realized, data can play a huge role in limiting the impact of viral phenomena \u2013 diseases, protests, misinformation\u2026.the list goes on.\n  Data and IT security will become even more important for businesses. Traditional businesses, including heavy industries, will find it difficult to survive without access to information that would help with optimization and extracting efficiency.\n    Asset heavy businesses like the ones related to oil, commodities, infrastructure will move to an asset-light model where financing of their activity would happen through public trusts, REITS, INVITs like structures. Equity financing would take over debt financing as businesses become reluctant to take on leverage.\n    Finally, big financial conglomerates with large balance sheet\u00a0exposure will become history. We\u2019ll see the emergence of specialized segmental lenders who will strive to make better lending decisions through AI &amp; social intelligence. Traditional lenders will exit the game.\n    Countries like China &amp; India stand to benefit from low crude-oil prices and a younger population which can kick in low-ticket consumption demand. While the world is currently dominated by right-wing politicians who propagate the concept of \u2018Make Local, Consume Local \u2019, the world will find comfort, once again, in the arms of capitalism. Free markets and abolishment of trade restrictions can be expected in the post-Covid  ...\n  Money will ultimately win. Most businesses that manage to survive the Covid-era financially, will have the ability to emerge victorious. As they say, \u201cYou need to live, to be in the game \u201d. Internet-based B2C businesses \u2013lending, financial services, need-based solutions will stand to gain. Once the world sees through this pandemic, there will be a jump in rental demand, entertainment, travel and tourism. The cement,  ...\n  The paper industry is one that has the highest chances of getting wiped out as the world looks to adopt environmentally friendly ways to live. As stated earlier, digital will be the new normal.\n    With respect to India, the discussion can be bifurcated into 2 parts \u2013 India\u2019s economy, and its stock markets.\n  The recovery of the underlying economy will be slow, and it will take around 2 years for normalcy to come back across sectors. While the overall economy might take a hit because of the government lockdown, some sectors are set to see immense growth in the post-Covid era \u2013 FMCG, B2C specialised lenders, gold-dependent companies, food retail and pharmaceutical companies to name a few.\n  Stock markets have a mind of their own, formed by the collective emotions + intelligence of millions. They are often skewed and aren \u2019t the best indicators of the underlying economy. Stock markets will have a strong recovery, not due to the fundamentals strength, but due to global liquidity which is available for almost free (as interest rates tend to near zero). Availability of debt capital will be scarce  ...\n    Like its counterparts across the globe, the Indian government has announced a slew of measures to prevent total collapse. However, it isn\u2019t enough. This works to alleviate some of the pain, not counter it. My 2 cents (or one barrel of oil) on what the government ought to do:\n  Loosen its purse and spend money on infrastructure development \u2013\u00a0 \u2018Rebuild India, Rejuvenate India\u2019\n  Public sector financial institutions need to be further capitalized and nudged by the RBI to lend out low-ticket loans below INR 1 Crore in the form of working capital to ensure that liquidity comes back into the system\n  Banking sector needs to be nudged to pass on rate cuts induced by RBI to the borrowers\n  Personal tax cuts &amp; tax holidays for 6 \u2013 12 months can be adopted to revive consumption, which will help spur economic growth\n    Before we end, let\u2019s look at some of the behavioural/societal impacts that Covid-19 might have.\n  During the course of the pandemic, people will be using digital medium for content and entertainment. Events that require massive gathering of people \u2013 sports, music festivals, theatre, etc. will take a hit for the next 12 months.\n  As the world overcomes this pandemic, discretionary demand will pick up as people become imprudent. Retail leverage in the world will hit new highs. The use of addictive material \u2013 tobacco, narcotics, alcoholic beverages will jump multifold.\n  The next 5 years are going to be the golden period for media and entertainment. 3D/4D chatrooms and conference rooms will emerge rapidly. The largest chunk of media spending will shift from television to digital. Print media will cease to exist.\n  Businesses will experience an increase in productivity due to reduced staff. Remote work will see an uptick. The burden on local transportation infra will ease. Fewer roads, less traffic &amp; pollution.\n    This may be the time to reset. Never before has the world come to a standstill where one can pick apart the many moving pieces \u2013 like Tom Cruise in Minority Report. We have the opportunity to rethink everything. If we do things right, we may be able to fix challenges that face humankind \u2013 environmental damage, inequality etc.\n  More importantly, we must ensure something like this never happens again. History says that humankind has never learnt from history. Let\u2019s hope that it\u2019s a thing of the past.\n  Disclaimer: This is a guest article.

"note_en": "Yes, you read that title right. While working on a new way to create finite state machines (fsm), I inadvertently designed a state machine you can execute at compile-time. With branching and everything. Today, allow me to pull you down my rabbit hole. It\u2019s always nicer with company down here.\n   I have this friend, you see, and he works in the c++ audio industry. DSP things and all that good stuff. Every time I show him a new piece of code I find interesting, he goes on and on about his \u201caudio callback\u201d and \u201chard real time\u201d and \u201cskipping a frame\u201d and and and. It is never-ending, I tell you. While discussing some of his current issues with a project he\u2019s working on, I recommended a fsm. It would fix all his problems and probably eradicate many state management bugs he has.\n State machines are great. I love them and you should too. When you  must have state, they are the way to go. However, remember that \u201caudio callback\u201d my dear friend keeps rambling about. Well, inside one of those, you cannot use  std::function. Apparently, you can\u2019t even use C function pointers. You really want your compiler to be able to inline everything it sees fit.\n And so, I set out to make an inlinable state machine. One without  std::function or function pointers. I want one anyways. [spoiler alert] That fsm isn\u2019t done yet, I\u2019ve been a little bit detracted from my goal.\n As my new fsm design evolved, all the while gazing absently at my sanity escaping, I realised what I had done. A  constexpr executable state machine, with many of the bells and whistles you\u2019d expect. Forgive me Bjarne for I have sinned.\n  Since I\u2019ll be going pretty deep in terms of c++ stuff later on, how about I start with a simple demonstration. This is a very theoretical example, used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system.\n The API, on Windows at least, isn\u2019t half bad if I do say so myself. I was going to write a poem for Microsoft\u2019s compiler, but my poetry skills threw an exception. Instead, here is a heartfelt letter to Visual Studio\u2019s compiler. Written at compile-time, of course.\n   Lets look at the code used to generate this wonderful and delightful masterpiece of literature. I will assume you\u2019ve worked with fsms before, since explaining that concept here will turn this already too long post into a way too short novel. I will also use the Visual Studio version of the code, as it is more readable and doesn\u2019t need any macro (clang and gcc need 1 macro, more on that later).\n  // Used to demonstrate branching.  #if defined(NDEBUG) \t static  constexpr  bool debug_build  = false; #else \t static  constexpr  bool debug_build  = true; #endif \t // Used to turn on/off messages. \t static  constexpr  bool assert_val  = true;\t enum  class   transition {\t\tdo_intro,\t\tdo_debug,\t\tdo_release,\t\tdo_paragraph,\t\tdo_outro,\t\tcount,  // count is required by fsm \t};\t enum  class   state {\t\tintro,\t\tdebug,\t\trelease,\t\tparagraph,\t\toutro,\t\tcount,  // count is required by fsm \t};\n Nothing special going on here. We have a few compile-time variables to branch on, and we define our letter writing state machine. We will start in  intro, then either transition to  debug or  release, then  paragraph and finally  outro.\n  fsm_builder &lt;transition, state &gt; builder;\t // intro \t auto intro_transitions\t\t\t = builder.make_transition &lt;transition ::do_debug, state ::debug &gt;()\t\t\t\t\t .make_transition &lt;transition ::do_release, state ::release &gt;();\t auto intro_events\t\t\t = builder.make_event &lt;fsm_event ::on_enter &gt;([]( auto &amp; machine) {\t\t\t\t\t\t  static_assert(assert_val,  &#34;Dear&#34;);\t\t\t\t\t\t  if  constexpr (debug_build) {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  return machine. template trigger &lt;transition ::do_debug &gt;();\t\t\t\t\t\t }  else{  return  ...\n OK! Things are getting interesting. First we create an  fsm_builder. It needs to know about our  transition and our  state enum classes. I\u2019ve discussed this non-type template technique in the past  here. I really like it. It is very robust and all the user needs to do is make sure his enums finish with  count, which is a best-practice anyhow.\n With that builder, we create our transitions and events. The api is written in this \u201cchaining\u201d style to simplify usage. The  make_transition accept a  transition enum value and a  state enum value. This is the association between which transition go to which state. Calling a transition that isn\u2019t handled by a state will  static_assert.\n The events are self-explanatory. The fsm supports the standard  on_enter,  on_update,  on_exit and  on_enter_from. And the rare, yet infinitely powerful,  on_exit_to. You must provide the machine with lambdas, as function pointers are runtime. The first argument of each of your event lambdas is a reference to the state machine itself. This is quite useful with runtime machines, and as you\u2019ll see, with  constexprmachines as well. After that, you can add whichever argument you wish, since  ...\n  Then, depending on whether or not we are compiling in debug, we will trigger the  do_debug transition or the  do_release transition.\n The  on_update event will never be called, but if it were, it would return 0.\n Finally, just to show an example, we use the  on_exit_to event. If we exit to  debug, we print \u201cslow Visual Studio Compiler,\u201d. If not, we print \u201crelatively fast Visual Studio Compiler\u201d.\n Notice that the triggers  must return their value. The next state is encoded in the return value and the machine needs this. Also, clang and gcc complain about  .template, so I add  .template.\n Finally, we create the state using the builder\u2019s  make_state. We pass our  state::intro enum value in the template, and provide the transitions and events as input arguments.  In that order.\n The other states creation is more of the same. We first make our transitions, then our events and create states using those. Here they are.\n // debug \t auto debug_transitions  = builder.make_transition &lt;transition ::do_paragraph,\t\t\tstate ::paragraph &gt;();\t auto debug_events\t\t\t = builder.make_event &lt;fsm_event ::on_enter &gt;([]( auto &amp; m) {\t\t\t\t\t\t  static_assert(assert_val,  &#34;In debug mode,&#34;);\t\t\t\t\t\t  return m. template trigger &lt;transition ::do_paragraph &gt;();\t\t\t\t\t })\t\t\t\t\t .make_event &lt;fsm_event ::on_update &gt;(\t\t\t\t\t\t\t []( auto &amp;) {  return  1; });\t auto debug_state\t\t\t = builder.make_state &lt;state ::debug &gt;(debug_transitions,  ...\n  We define  on_enter events and  on_update events. The triggers occur on enter. Finally, the outro doesn\u2019t trigger anything or go anywhere, which will stop the \u201cexecution\u201d of the fsm. The builder has helpers  empty_t() and  empty_s() since you  must provide the adequate arguments when calling  make_state.\n This is quite verbose, but hopefully not too cryptic. Now, lets run this machine. Hold on to yer helmets!\n   We create the state machine using  make_machine and our previously created states. Then, we execute  init() which will call  on_enter of our starting state (the first state you pass to  make_machine). That will in turn execute its trigger, which will in turn proceed to the next state, which will execute its trigger, etc. Until we reach outro.\n   Not only does this compile, but since we are now in our  outro state, it correctly returns the answer to life : 42. Of course, since we executed the machine at compile-time, we can capture the resulting value as  constexpr, and I guess do some very fancy things with it!\n  This is great and all, but not very useful. In my unit tests, I have  an example of a state machine that conditionally fills up a  tuple at compile-time, according to its transitions. You can imagine building a plethora of objects at compile-time, dependent on some compile options provided by the user or the environment.\n You can also pass on the state machine as a template argument, so you can use it to conditionally initialize structs\u2019  static constexpr variables. For example.\n template  &lt; class   Machine &gt; struct my_obj {\t static  constexpr  auto my_conditional_variable  = Machine ::update();}; // Then, fill a tuple with types who&#39;ve been constructed conditionally. // Call triggers on the state machine to change value returned by .update().\n Fsms are good at managing state. Compile-time branching is state. So, if your software has a mess of  ifdefsand compile-time checks, this fsm should help you manage that. You can imagine a scenario where we are compiling cross-platform; windows, mac and linux. We have code that is generated dependent on the platform, in addition to a debug and release build type. Maybe we have some code that also checks c++ feature macros, etc. This becomes quite unmanageable in the long  ...\n You could define a state machine with 3 base states, windows, mac and linux. Then, define transitions to the code that needs to be generated. Lets say, an instantiate_renderer state. You can now override the behavior using  on_enter_from and  on_exit_to. Since the fsm doesn\u2019t have conditional transitions (aka transition guards), you could use different states for debug and release, so on and so forth.\n With a simple  init() call, you can generate all your compile-time branch dependent code, and make sure the behavior is well thought out, predictable, clear to understand and  static_asserts if you forgot to implement a required transition or state.\n  I\u2019ve already mentioned a few, but I feel the need to discuss the limitations of the design.\n One big trade-off is compile-times, clearly. The APIs are also very verbose and not as visually pleasing as with runtime state machines. Though I\u2019d say it is very reasonable considering what we are doing. Error messages, well\u2026 You know what you are getting into.\n Since I\u2019m unsure how useful this fsm is in reality, I\u2019m weary to add any more features to the machine. I do not want to over-complexify the code for something that seems very niche at this point.\n Another limitation is, whenever you call  trigger inside your fsm, you  must return the value. If you call  trigger during an update, you will need to capture the result as it is your new \u201cstate\u201d. For example :\n auto my_machine  = builder.make_machine(...).init();\t auto my_new_machine  = my_machine.update();  // If updates call triggers, you must capture the result.\n This makes the fsm much less useful overall, though I\u2019ve found quite a few ways around this while writing examples and unit tests.\n If you want to return a user value from your update events, while also calling  trigger, you could return a  tuple of both the trigger return value and a  std::optional user value. Since the return types are also yours to customize, you can really design a state machine that fits your needs.\n The MSVC compiler is very relaxed compared to clang and gcc. It allows for  static constexpr variables inside  static constexpr functions. This isn\u2019t \u201clegal\u201d C++, though I\u2019ve read there is a proposal for such a thing. Until we get this feature, on clang and gcc, you will need to use a macro  fea_event to pass on your events. The first argument is your event name, and the second is your event lambda. You later provide the event name to the  make_eventfunction. Like  ...\n fea_event(intro_onenter, []( auto &amp; machine) {\t\t static_assert(assert_val,  &#34;Dear&#34;);\t\t if  constexpr (debug_build) {\t\t\t return machine. template trigger &lt;transition ::do_debug &gt;();\t\t}  else {\t\t\t return machine. template trigger &lt;transition ::do_release &gt;();\t\t}\t});\tfea_event(intro_onupdate, []( auto &amp;) {  return  0; });\tfea_event(intro_onexitto_debug, []( auto &amp;) {\t\t static_assert(assert_val,  &#34;slow Visual Studio Compiler,&#34;); }); fea_event(intro_onexitto_release,  ...\n   Before I go into the details, it is mandatory you understand the concepts presented in  this great read. If you do not understand Michael Park\u2019s post, you will not understand what I am about to show. If you do however, then it\u2019s smooth sailing from here till the end of this never ending wall of text.\n Alright lets do this. I won\u2019t go every single line of code here, as you can find the full source on-line (links at the end). I just want to explain the major concepts.\n The state machine uses a very simple container I dubbed  tuple_map. Think of it as a compile-time  std::map, where you can query objects using types instead of runtime values. The tuple map is simply 2 tuples. One with keys, known to us and with which we\u2019ll do our searches, and one with values unknown to us (the lambdas). Here is a rough sketch of what it looks like, just to get an idea.\n struct tuple_map {\t // Search by template. \t template  &lt; class   Key &gt;\t static  constexpr  const  auto &amp; find() {\t\t constexpr size_t idx  = tuple_idx_v &lt;Key, keys_tup_t &gt;;\t\t return std ::get &lt;idx &gt;(_values);\t}\t // Does the map contain the key? \t template  &lt; class   Key &gt;\t static  constexpr  bool contains() {\t\t constexpr  bool ret  = tuple_contains_v &lt;Key, keys_tup_t &gt;;\t\t return ret;\t} private :\t // Used to find the index of the value inside the other tuple. std  ...\n tuple_idx_v and  tuple_contains_v are just a simple type trait you can find on stackoverflow. They would be nice additions to the standard.\n Next up, lets dive into our \u201cbuilders\u201d. The state machine encodes all its information into templates. That is why I use chaining apis. The builder will return a builder type, which can in turn return a new builder type with the appropriate information encoded in the templates. Here is a \u201cpseudo-c++\u201d example just to illustrate the idea.\n // Start here.  struct builder {\t auto make_transition() {\t\t // Start with a parent of type void. \t\t return transition_builder &lt; int,  void &gt;{};\t}}; // Then, return a builder which can recursively return builders // with data encoded in the template type.  template  &lt; class   Whatever,  class   Parent &gt; struct transition_builder {\t template  &lt; class   NewType &gt;\t auto make_transition() {\t\t // Recursively append the Parent information to the template. \t\t usingparent_t  ...\n Now, what if we were to encode in those templates, the information we need to build keys for our  tuple_map mentioned earlier? We could build up a  struct which contains all the transitions and their destination states. All we would need is some function to make sense of all this. Lets do just that.\n First, we define a key which contains the enum types and their non-type templates. We need this as the  tuple_map really doesn\u2019t play friendly with non-type templates. This is what we\u2019ll use later on to find transitions.\n template  &lt; class   TransitionEnum, TransitionEnum FromTransition &gt; struct fsm_transition_key {}; // Usage example : // TransitionEnum is the user enum class of transitions. // FromTransition is a non-type template of that enum, for example transition::do_outro. StateEnum my_target_state  = my_tuple_map.find &lt;fsm_transition_key &lt;TransitionEnum, FromTransition &gt;&gt;();\n Now back to the  transition_builder, we add an  unpack() api which will unroll all of our gathered transitions (encoded in our template types) and return a  tuple of that. This time, not pseudo-code.\n // We need, the type of the transition enum, the type of the state enum, // the transition enum value, the state enum value and the parent types.  template  &lt; class   TransitionEnum,  class   StateEnum, TransitionEnum FromT,\t\tStateEnum ToS,  class   Parent &gt; struct transition_builder {\t // Creates a new transition, with key NewFromT transition and value NewToS state. \t template  &lt;TransitionEnum NewFromT, StateEnum NewToS &gt;\t static  constexpr  automake_transition()  ...\n I tried to explain as best I can in the comments. Ultimately, we recurse through our types and build a  tuple&lt;tuple&lt;key, value&gt;&gt; for later. That will later be split into a  tuple&lt;keys...&gt; and a  tuple&lt;values...&gt; used to build our  tuple_map.\n  There is one last thing to go over, and that is really the key to making this whole thing compile-time. Everything needs to be  static constexpr. The \u201cmember variables\u201d, the functions, absolutely everything. That is why, as a user, you don\u2019t really need to use  constexpr when you create your transitions or your states. The objects don\u2019t really exist. Everything is encoded in templates, through  static constexpr.\n For example, lets take our  fsm_transition_builder and initialize a real  tuple_map with it. First, we need to convert the  tuple&lt;tuple&lt;key, values&gt;&gt; into 2 separate tuples.\n template  &lt; class   Builder &gt; constexpr  auto make_tuple_map() {\t // At compile-time, take the tuple of tuple coming from the \t // builder, iterate through it, grab the first elements of \t // nested tuples (the key) and put that in a new tuple, grab \t // the second elements and put that in another tuple. \t // Basically, go from tuple&lt;tuple&lt;key, value&gt;...&gt; to \t // tuple&lt;tuple&lt;key...&gt;, tuple&lt;values...&gt;&gt; \t // which is our map basically.  ...\n  OK here\u2019s what to keep an eye out for. First off, we don\u2019t even need to accept a variable as input. Since our  fsm_transition_builder only has  static constexpr functions, we only need to know its type. That is the magic described in mpark\u2019s blog post and how you write truly compile-time only code.\n std::apply didn\u2019t work here as it resulted in a non-constexpr expression. Instead, I use the descriptively named  tuple_expander5000, which takes a non-type  size_t and calls your lambda with some generated  std::integral_constant&lt;size_t, I&gt;.... This way, we can use the underlying index value to access a compile-time index  decltype(Idxes)::value. With that value, we  std::get each nested tuple, and we either  std::get&lt;0&gt; or  std::get&lt;1&gt;  ...\n  Notice this expansion is encoded in a struct, inside a  static constexpr auto unpack() function as well. I use local structs throughout the system, since they can encode the incoming templates in their  unpack() functions. We also need to do this for the  tuple_map, as it needs to have  static constexpr \u201cmember\u201d variables. Like so.\n // The real tuple_map.  template  &lt; class   KeysBuilder,  class   ValuesBuilder &gt; struct tuple_map {\t /* ... */ private :\t // Used to find the index of the value inside the other tuple. \t static  constexpr  auto _keys  = KeysBuilder ::unpack();  // &lt;--- look here \t // Your values. \t static  constexpr  auto _values  = ValuesBuilder ::unpack();  // &lt;--- and here \t using keys_tup_t  = std ::decay_t &lt; decltype(_keys) &gt;;\t using values_tup_t  = std ::decay_t &lt; decltype  ...\n  To initialize  static constexpr member variables, we cannot use a constructor. Not even a  constexpr constructor (those would be much more useful if the compiler could figure out  this has been initialized as  constexpr).\n To initialize our compile-time objects, we must pack data into template types. Later, we need to unpack that data calling a  static constexpr function, which only requires we know the type. Magic!\n  One final gripe and the necessary macro. Visual Studio happily compiles and executes the following.\n struct event_builder {\t template  &lt; class   Func &gt;\t static  constexpr  auto make_event(Func func)\t\t // Store a static constexpr version of the passed in user lambda, \t\t // until we need to unpack it later to copy it into a tuple_map. \t\t static  constexpr  auto f  = func;  // &lt;--- problematic line \t\t struct func_wrapper {\t\t\t // Return the user function. \t\t\t static  constexpr  auto unpack() {\t\t\t\t return f;\t\t\t}\t\t};\t\t using parent_t  =  /* not important right  ...\n However,  static constexpr variables inside  static constexpr functions aren\u2019t theoretically supported in c++. Even though I read about a  constexpr function relaxation proposals, I couldn\u2019t find the status of it. It has likely not been prioritized since use cases are few and far between. Anyhow, because of this language limitation we must provide a user macro which will wrap a user lambda into a  static constexpr function.\n // Do some pasting to make the struct name unique. // Create a struct which &#34;pastes&#34; the user lambda f in a static constexpr function. // Creates an instance of this struct, named name.  #define FEA_TOKENPASTE(x, y) x##y #define FEA_TOKENPASTE2(x, y) FEA_TOKENPASTE(x, y) #define fea_event(name, f) \\ \tstruct FEA_TOKENPASTE2( \\ \t\t\tFEA_TOKENPASTE2(fea_event_builder_, name), __LINE__) { \\ \t\tusing is_event_builder = int; \\ static constexpr  ...\n     In conclusion, we \u2019ve seen that where there \u2019s a will and a c++17 compiler, you can pretty much accomplish whatever the hell you want. I think I \u2019ve been through all the key points required to create a compile-time executable state machine in c++. If you understand all these template meta programming concepts well, sky is the limit! The full code is actually quite compact and readable, which goes to show how much the language has  ...\n Below is the github repo with my state machine collection, including this one. There are a few more examples in the unit tests. I only very recently made these public and they are far from final. I still need to go through and cleanup a lot of stuff (especially the state chart). Also, I haven\u2019t finished the  real runtime state machine that uses the  tuple_map design. It is in the works.\n    Thanks to  Michael Park for his innovative  static constexpr technique. Thanks to Philippe Sawicki for some amazing brain-storms on compile-time validated fsms.
