"note_en": "Disruptions, downturns, and recessions make the weak weaker and the strong stronger. It was true centuries ago, and it is true today.\n The 2001 downturn turned telecom and cable giants into the Internet\u2019s gatekeepers. Microsoft emerged victorious with its Internet Explorer. During the 2008 financial crisis, when cash was king, the big banks \u2014 JP Morgan Chase, for example \u2014 became more prominent and more pervasive. In a similar fashion, the present pandemic is making big tech bigger. And it is not just that their coffers are overflowing coffers. They suddenly have a much larger and more receptive audience.\n Last week, we saw the mid-pandemic report record results for Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook. Spoiler alert: they\u2019re not exactly suffering. Microsoft saw its revenues go up to $35 billion for the quarter, compared to $30.5 billion for the same quarter in 2019. Amazon\u2019s revenues came in over $75 billion. Even with a shutdown, Apple reported earnings of $58 billion. You get the drift.\n Even with worsening economic conditions over the next year or so, these companies are likely to come out big winners. Though, the upshot is not just that a handful of companies will become a more significant presence in our lives. This will be true of technology in general. Sure, there might be some companies \u2014 AirBnB, for example \u2014that suffer in the near term. The startup ecosystem might contract. But overall, this is a big moment for technology, and it\u2019s only going to get bigger.\n If you live long enough, you experience enough downturns to develop at least one of two things: mental resilience or post-traumatic stress disorder. I now need at least two hands to count on my fingers the number of downturns I have experienced. These experiences have largely supported my blind faith in the power of the network and the inevitability of technology. This time around is no different.\n Over the past few months, we have experienced the mainstreaming of technology-enabled behavior previously thought of as being on the fringe. Shopping for groceries online and having them delivered, for example, was something of coastal luxury. Now, it has been experienced and used by millions across the country. Instacart has boasted of hiring another 250,000 shoppers. Amazon is hiring an additional 175,000 delivery people. Food-on-demand services are going through a boom like none other \u2014Doordash  ...\n In a conversation this week, Wired editor Nicholas Thompson marveled at the growth in telemedicine and online education, two technologies (for lack of a better term) that have been around for so long that we often overlook them. Khan Academy has seen 20 times as many registrations. The Silicon Valley investors who viewed remote work and the distributed company as a net negative, and penalized companies that didn\u2019t have a physical presence in their backyard, are now \u201cwork from home\u201d gurus.\n Zoom has 300 million daily participants (which is not the same as users), while Slack has seen as many as 10 million simultaneously connected users. Microsoft\u2019s Slack competitor, Teams, now has more than 75 million daily active users. No matter what, most companies have now experienced \u201cworking from home,\u201d and they are unlikely to just return to their old ways. Once we get accustomed to new behaviors, it is hard for us to go back\n Before technology became so pervasive in the lives of everyday people, it was a luxury for corporations, educational institutions, and governments. Servers, switches, big databases, and productivity software didn \u2019t impact most of us very much. The personal computers were great, but they only sold a mere hundred million units at their peak, and a big chunk of those went to the buyers mentioned above. The Internet changed all that. Technology became us, and we became technology. If anything,  ...\n Just as the productivity gains that were expected of big companies became commonplace in mid-sized operations over the past two decades, we have seen the convenience-of-technology flow downwards. What was \u201cproductivity\u201d for corporations and organizations has morphed into \u201cconvenience\u201d for us normals.\n The economic downturn at the beginning of the millennium saw the emergence of broadband connectivity and its pervasiveness. Seven years later, we all embraced the social web, and then the mobile and app revolution. And as the pandemic ravages our social fabric, we are seeing a wholesale digital transformation in a compressed time frame. Each economic setback creates a craving for convenience, and in the long-term, this opens the door for the widespread adoption of technology.\n Whether we like it or not, we are addicted to it now. We like being able to watch movies and television shows when we want, where we want, and on the screen we want. We love ordering food and groceries and want them delivered. Ironically, the consumer-focused services have been much more prepared for the future than the enterprises, which have been slower in embracing the significant shift to cloud, data, and automation.\n But not anymore! Kicking and screaming, they have been brought into the future. \u201cWe have seen two years\u2019 worth of digital transformation in two months,\u201d noted Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a call with Wall Street analysts after reporting earnings that were just shy of astounding. Box CEO Aaron Levie noted that \u201cyears of IT acceleration being compressed into months.\u201d\n Levie also quipped that he had spoken to \u201cmultiple Fortune 500 CIOs in the past two days who have been implementing a fundamentally different IT strategy than they would have had a year ago. \u201dThey are all thinking more cloud, more digital, and more automation. Others have observed this shift in perspective. In a call with investors, ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott noted that the pandemic has been an accelerant for digital transformation, which has now become a business imperative.

"note_en": "As a founder, there comes a time when you need a business plan, complete with financial forecasts, income statements, and fancy graphs that will impress your investors.\n  A financial model allows you to draft financial projections easily, fast, and in a professional manner. A great template will also force you to think through all the aspects of your project and make sure you really get the financial logic behind your business.\n  This post compares the top 12 templates of financial models for SaaS startups. I have personally tested each model. I have ranked them on 40+ items along 5 categories. I&#39;ve looked at both spreadsheets and SaaS apps, and both free and paid solutions.\n         I compared 40 points across 5 categories: (a) financial statements, (b) analysis capabilities, (c) revenue modeling, (d) cost modeling, (e) extra features. A detailed analysis of each model is available below. In each case, I tested the software/spreadsheet myself.\n  Time scale: Are the statements over 1 year, 3 years or more? You usually want 3 years as a minimum when you speak with professional investors.\n  Income statement: Does the template include an income statement? You usually want a monthly income statement, at least for year 1.\n  Financial analysis: Number of typical financial metrics included e.g. breakeven point, quick ratio, average inventory, etc.\n  SaaS analysis: Number of typical SaaS metrics included e.g. MRR growth, SaaS magic number, CAC/LTV, etc.\n    Costs by P&amp;L category: Does the template break down costs into P&amp;L categories (CoGS, RD, G&amp;A, etc.)\n  Costs by departments: Does the model break down costs into departments (sales, marketing, CS, engineering, etc)\n      VS Actuals: Does the template allow you to run your model versus your actual numbers?\n  New client acquisition: How do you enter new clients into the model? Possibilities include: entering a number manually for each month or year (it sucks); autofill the model from a base number and a growth rate (sucks a bit less); autofill several streams - each stream represents a different type of client e.g SMB/enterprise (better); or even fully model each acquisition channel (the best, very rare)\n  Offerings: How many offers can you define and how precisely can you model them? This includes the possibility to create one-off offers, recurring offers, or a combo, but also the possibility to create introduction times and end times for specific offers.\n  Pricing model: How many pricing models can you define and how precisely: tiers (free, basic, premium), revenue models (per seat, per usage, etc), automatically increase or decrease the plans price over years.\n      Service revenue: Can you model punctual service revenue on top of all the other pricing models and offerings?\n  Enterprise specific: Does the template offer specific features to model complex enterprise sales, such as landing/expansion, custom product developments, various sales cycles, etc?\n  Direct labor costs: The best templates allow you to correlate direct labor costs with relevant metrics. For example, your sales staff is calculated based on forecasted income and sales target per account executive. Same for customer success payroll with number of customers and workload target per CS staff.\n  Direct non-labor costs: just like with labor costs, the best templates allow you to link some direct non-labor costs with relevant metrics. For instance, server costs can be a % of MRR.\n  Indirect labor costs: same as above. Even for indirect costs, some templates find smart ways to tie them to some aspect of the business.\n    Payment terms: Can you define the payments terms with your vendors and suppliers? May be useful if there is a hardware component to your offer.\n  Hardware-friendly: This is a special mention for templates that model things like shipping costs, inventory delay, etc.\n  Documentation : Is there proper documentation in the model and on the website? Are there good explainer videos? What kind of direct support (chat, email) comes with the template?\n    Third-party integration: Third-party integrations can be useful to input or update data over time, or to display advanced graphs.\n  Excel spreadsheet: Can you access your financials as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet? This is a must if you need to share it with investors.\n  Google Sheets: Does the model work in Google Sheets? Not all models that work in Microsoft Excel work in Google, so you may want to consider that point.\n  Editable formulas: Some templates do not allow you to modify formulas - which is a massive bummer when it comes to customization.\n Granted, it&#39;s not a perfect methodology. One could argue forever about whether cap tables should be included in a financial model for startups. But it&#39;s the best I could come up with - without being a finance nerd myself :)\n     Affiliation: Some links in the article are affiliated - which means that if you end up buying a template through one of those links, I&#39;ll get a few $$$. This doesn&#39;t cost you anything, and allows me to keep writing useful articles for you.\n  Impartiality: Regardless of whether there is a referral in place or not, I am committed to providing you with an honest opinion. I take great pride in being an independant, honest, and trusted source of information for entrepreneurs.\n  Non finito: This is a non-finite work. I am happy to update the article if you bring new, relevant information to my knowledge. I am also happy to fix any mistake or clarify any confusion that you may find in the article.\n     For years, this template has been the go-to financial model for French entrepreneurs. However, it didn&#39;t age well.\n Analysis capabilities are limited: only a handful of financial metrics, zero SaaS metrics, a couple of graphs, and it&#39;s impossible to categorize costs. Modeling, be it for revenue or costs, is all too basic and requires a lot of manual input. Also, it&#39;s entirely in French.\n Having said that, it remains a free-of-charge, easy-to-use, easy-to-customize template that covers all the basics while including specificities to the French ecosystem such as CIR, JEI, etc.\n This model makes a lot of sense for French entrepreneurs looking for a simple solution. For the others, keep on reading.\n        This template was built by SaaS apostle Christoph Janz, and you can tell. It packs a punch of SaaS knowledge in a sleek, clear spreadsheet. You&#39;ll find lots of good stuff: basic/pro/enterprise plans, churn/upgrade/downgrade, an elegant client acquisition model and a wealth of graphs and charts.\n It&#39;s not all rosy, though. You want a 5 years forecast? No, you only need 2. You want to sell annual pro plans? Too bad, pro plans are monthly and that&#39;s that. Also, no balance sheet.\n This template works great if you are a typical SaaS startup and fits the vision that Christoph put into his financial plan. If not, you may be better off considering templates with broader horizons.\n        This one got updated just before publishing the article, so I have to scratch my old review and write a new one. I&#39;ll take care of that soon enough.\n       This template published by Ben Murray, AKA the SaaS CFO, has a lot in common with Chris Janz&#39;s model: it&#39;s free, it&#39;s SaaS-centric and it&#39;s really good overall.\n  Cost modeling: Janz does a much better job as many costs are tied to activity metrics. With Murray, you have to fill it all manually. Janz 1 - 0 Murray\n  Commitment: Murray allows you to define which plans are annual and which are monthly. Janz does not. Janz 1 - 1 Murray\n  Client acquisition: Murray wants you to manually input new clients each month, where Janz includes 3 acquisition channels. Janz 2 - 1 Murray\n  Murray also allows you to add service revenue and offers up to 5 years of forecasts. Janz 2 - 2 Murray\n  Since its latest update, Murray&#39;s model also allows you to input your actual number and compare them with your forecasts. Janz 2 - 3 Murray\n At the end of the day, Murray&#39;s SaaS template is great - maybe the best amongst the free templates. It is a bit disappointing when it comes to modeling new client acquisition and costs, though.\n        Because you&#39;re paying, you obviously get a lot more in return: balance sheet, cap table, GAAP/IFRS compliance, 161 currencies to choose from, a ton of financial metrics and graphs, and advanced capabilities to model your costs and your revenue, including for hardware startups.\n Now, because we are paying, we are a lot pickier. And I see 3 problems with this SaaS Startup Kit. First, you cannot account for upgrades and downgrades (you can model churn, though). Second, you cannot break down costs by P&amp;L categories or departments. Third, the formulas are &#34;locked &#39; so you cannot edit them. That&#39;s a big problem if, like me, you like looking under the hood. But maybe you don&#39;t care?\n     All in all, I cannot tell you not to look at the SaaS startup kit. It has a lot going for it, and at $99, it&#39;s priced right. But if you can stretch your budget a little more, look at the next model - it may well be the right one.\n     Let me start right off the bat: this &#34;SaaS Financial Model&#34; by Taylor Davidson is one of the best templates out there.\n For $149, you get all the financial statements you may wish for, laid out over 5 years, and GAAP-compliant. Additional tabs are built-in for fundraising (assess needs and uses), valuation (ownership, DCF, waterfall exit, ROI), variants (simplified scenarios), and impact (for purpose-driven startups). Bonus point: the model works in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, supports all currencies, and is fully editable.\n In terms of analysis capabilities, the template generates boatloads of financial and SaaS metrics, as well as 20+ beautiful graphs. Costs can be broken down by departments and P&amp;L categories so you can make sense of all that good stuff. SaaS experts will especially appreciate the granularity provided by monthly cohort analysis - a rarity!\n Modeling revenue and costs is extremely versatile. Instead of pre-modeling everything for you, the template provides you with very unique features (Pricing, Pipeline, Drivers) that allow you to customize it to your needs. Here are a few examples of what you can do:\n Contract length is not limited to monthly or annual but can be anything you want.\n  Billings are separate from contract cycles, so can do an annual contract with quarterly billings, or 3-year contract with annual billings, or annual contract with monthly billings\n  All costs, direct and indirect, labor and non-labor, can be tied to relevant activity metrics (revenue, headcount, etc.) which is what you would expect from this kind of template.\n  All costs can also be tied that are *not* tied to an activity metric, say periodic costs that occur quarterly or annually, or costs that increase a % over time, or costs that are a % of salaries, or a % of revenues, for example. This is all built-in within the Drivers sheet and an absolute delight to use.\n  For Enterprise sales, you can model a good old Pipeline in the Pipeline sheet and attribute different numbers of seats and &#34;likelihood to close&#34; to each deal.\n True, it takes a bit of time to wrap your head around the internal logic of that model. But once you master it, there is virtually no limit to what you can do.\n Thankfully, this financial model is well-documented. The website includes a long, detailed &#34;Getting Started&#34; page as well as specific articles and videos for technical points. The highlight is definitely the email support - I&#39;ve consistently received detailed replies within 24 hours - at zero extra cost. Kudos to that.\n Long story short - if you are willing to shell out $149 for a SaaS financial model, Taylor Davidon&#39;s template is arguably one of the absolute best you can get your hands on. The other one is the model built by Alexander Jarvis - read on to learn about it.\n        It&#39;s hard to write a serious review about this template - everything about it is absolutely ridiculous. It is ridiculously rich, ridiculously detailed, ridiculously powerful. It&#39;s the kind of template that you use when you want to make a statement, like impress your investors or make your CFO feel irrelevant. It&#39;s heavy, bold, and over-the-top, in the best way possible. Brace yourselves, let&#39;s dive in.\n This template by Alexander Jarvis comes in 2 versions. The &#34;SaaS: SME &amp; Users&#34; is perfectly fine for most SaaS businesses. It sells at $319. The &#34;SaaS: Enterprise, SME &amp; Users&#34; retails at $1,299 and includes extra logic to model enterprise sales. Because of their complexity, both models only work in Microsoft Excel (no Google Sheets).\n  Each acquisition channel is modeled in great details: paid, organic, blog, social, emailing, and channel partners. Each channel can be assigned its own conversion rate from visitor to user. You can also differentiate between the customers that self-onboard and those who require sales intervention.\n  You can design composite offerings based on usage fee, monthly fee and/or a one-time service fee. The templates allow 3 paid plans - typically basic, premium, pro - as well as a free trial plan, and each of these plans can exist with a monthly or annual commitment.\n  Customers can upgrade, downgrade or churn, and you can even schedule module releases at different points in time, so you create new revenue streams over the years.\n  All costs, direct and indirect, labor and non-labor, are modeled in a clever way i.e. they are tied to relevant activity metrics\n I cannot stress enough how detailed this model is. Here is an example: the &#34;email marketing&#34; tab (yes, there is such a thing) takes into account 12+ inputs including stuff like the % of recipients who will share the newsletter with their friends. I love this kind of detail because it gives actionable points when thinking about execution. It also makes it easier to defend your numbers in front of investors because you can explain the underlying  ...\n If you buy the $1,299 version, you get an extra slew of tabs specifically dedicated to enterprise sales in all its complexity: enterprise-specific products and offerings, geographies, sales cycles, &#34;land and expand&#34;, custom development, etc. If you are building the next Oracle or Palantir, that stuff alone is invaluable.\n Documentation is ok. Instructions and comments are included inside the template, but not much in terms of FAQ/articles on the website. Having said that, I particularly appreciated the tutorial videos: one 28-min overview and 20 shorter videos that each cover a specific tab.\n You want more? Time to talk about analysis capabilities. Alexander Jarvis&#39; model is most lavish when it comes to that point. 50+ graphs are readily available - and that&#39;s without counting the sparklines that are peppered throughout the sheet. Because modeling is so detailed, the template can provide advanced SaaS metrics such as marketing leverage or expansion % of new MRR. Of course, costs can be allocated to P&amp;L categories and departments  ...\n When it comes to financial statements, the $319 version gives you only 3 years of forecasts, with no balance sheet and no cap table. The $1,299 version does a bit better with 5-year forecasts, but still no sign of balance sheet nor cap table. Some would argue that an early-stage startup doesn&#39;t need formal financial statements... However, this template does include a tab to compare your forecasts to your actuals, and another tab listing down industry  ...\n If you want the best spreadsheet ever, it boils down to comparing Taylor Davidson&#39;s and Alexander Jarvis&#39; templates, and picking the one that fits you the most. See the final section &#34;Conclusion&#34; for a side-by-side of both models.\n    However, some prefer using a specialized SaaS app to build your financial model. If that&#39;s your case, check out the last 4 models.\n     The Finance Navigator was developed by Alexander Matthiessen and Wout Bobbink from EY&#39;s Dutch office. It&#39;s a SaaS app: you pay a monthly subscription to access an online tool. It&#39;s a fundamentally different approach from the spreadsheet-based models we&#39;ve explored so far.\n The Finance Navigator costs $30 per month without commitment or $380 over an 18 month period. For that price, you get very exhaustive financial statements: income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets over 10 years - no cap table though. All currencies are available and you can export the statements to a clean, well-designed spreadsheet format (only numbers, no formulas).\n Documentation is good, with in-app guidance, website posts, a Q&amp;A, and a 37 min walkthrough video. The tool was clearly thought to be user-friendly and the onboarding is best-in-class. You will have zero difficulties using EY&#39;s Finance Navigator whatsoever.\n Unfortunately, simplicity is a double-edged sword. Revenue and cost modeling is super basic. For example, revenue is defined as a base number for month 1, then a monthly growth rate. No channels, no conversion rate, no pricing plans. The same goes for costs: you cannot tie costs to specific activity metrics, so you have to input them manually. Because it&#39;s a SaaS application, you cannot customize the model by adding fields or modifying  ...\n At the end of the day, EY&#39;s Finance Navigator holds a lot of promises. UX is great and they have a couple of nice features like comparables and scenarios. The product has evolved over the years, adding up features and getting more usable. In my estimation, it&#39;s not quite enough to be used by advanced SaaS entrepreneurs. The product is geared towards traditional businesses - think bakery, restaurant, consulting, who just want clean  ...\n        Liveplan sells its financial modeling SaaS app at $20 per month ($360 over 18 months), which makes it a close competitor to EY Finance Navigator.\n Starting with the strong points, Liveplan offers exhaustive statements over 5 years: income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets. Compared with EY&#39;s model, you have a bit more control over revenue modeling: offerings can be defined as recurring fees, billable hours, and a one-time upfront fee can also be added. Pricing can be increased automatically over time, churn can be factored in, and you can model monthly or annual  ...\n When looking at cost modeling, you can adjust payment terms for clients and suppliers. There are also specific variables for hardware products. Documentation is just fine, with a tutorial video per section embedded directly in the app, as well as plenty of instructions. Liveplan exists in 5 languages, and integrates with Quickbooks, which allows importing your actual numbers and comparing them with your forecasts. You can also export your  ...\n Now, although Liveplan&#39;s software has more powerful modeling capacities than EY&#39;s, it remains insufficient in my estimation. Here are just a few examples.\n Direct labor costs can be set as a % of revenue, but do not update the number of employees accordingly.\n  Indirect costs can only be set as a constant, a % of overall revenue, or a % of a specific revenue.\n  New client acquisition is just manual input - as in you manually input &#34;2&#34; clients in March and &#34;4&#34; clients in April. There is no channel modeling whatsoever.\n When modeling is too superficial, it translates into poor analysis capabilities. In Liveplan&#39;s case, you do have a dozen financial metrics available (net cash flow, account payable, cash on hand\u2026) and another dozen graphs. But SaaS metrics are absent, which is a bummer for SaaS entrepreneurs.\n At the end of the day, LivePlan was built for non-tech entrepreneurs. Perfect for a bike shop owner, but not quite there for SaaS people.\n Don&#39;t take my word for it: there is a 60-day trial, so give it a spin for free and make up your own mind.\n        Summit is a young startup (founded 2019) that brings a fresh take on the whole financial modeling thing with a SaaS solution.\n Let&#39;s make it clear - Summit is not meant for fundraising. Forecasts on Summit are made for an 18-month period only. Costs cannot be allocated to P&amp;L categories and departments, nor can you differentiate between labor/non-labor or direct/indirect costs. Therefore, you won&#39;t be able to generate any financial statements that your investors may require . Hell, you can&#39;t even export a spreadsheet!\n So why talk about Summit? Because Summit is pretty awesome when it comes to piloting your SaaS startup with a financial model. Here is how it works. First you connect your live metrics (Stripe, Baremetrics, etc.) to your Summit account. This allows Summit to derive your future growth from the current trends. The next step consists in optimizing that future growth. To do that, you define a baseline scenario around 20+ metrics from  ...\n Summit is still a young product and there is room for improvement: currencies, tax rates, expansion and contraction of existing clients, one-off revenue. In particular, client acquisition would greatly benefit from more granularity and native integrations with social media accounts for instance.\n At the end of the day, Summit is not meant to build financial statements, but to make decisions in a data-driven way. It&#39;s such a refreshing approach in the space that I highly recommend trying it out. Bonus point: it&#39;s 100% free for now, so it&#39;s a no-brainer.\n        At first glance, Causal seemed very similar to Summit. It&#39;s also a SaaS solution, also founded in 2019, also bringing a new approach to modeling. But that&#39;s where the comparison stops because the philosophy behind Causal is quite unique.\n Causal is not just a financial modeling tool for SaaS startups. It&#39;s a modeling tool that aims at replacing Excel for every modeling need you may have. This means that (a) Causal is super versatile and goes much deeper than Summit, and (b) Causal is much more complex with a steeper learning curve than Summit.\n Looking at revenue and cost modeling, you can model anything you want on Causal with an interface that&#39;s 10x more modern and user-friendly than a spreadsheet. The same thing goes for analysis capabilities: you can generate dashboards, tables, and graphs for absolutely anything - including any financial statement your investors may want. You can also connect live data sources (Stripe and Google Sheets for now, more to  ...\n As a SaaS entrepreneur, you don&#39;t have time to build a model from scratch. Lucky you, Causal has built-in templates - including two SaaS models built by Taylor Davidson himself (see template #6). You are then able to augment or fine-tune those models to suit your specific needs.\n In terms of documentation, there are a few videos, a live chat as well as a walkthrough when you start a new model. That&#39;s not much, but Causal assumes that you are a modeling &#34;nerd&#34; and that your usual work environment is massive spreadsheets. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;ll be just fine. Assuming you have the time and desire to put in the hours to learn a new tool, Causal may very well be the ultimate  ...\n         If you want a &#34;good enough&#34; model but are not willing to pay for it, go for  Ben Murray&#39;s (model #4) or  Chris Janz&#39;s (model #2). Customize them a bit to offset their weaknesses.\n     If you want the best financial model spreadsheet out there and are willing to pay for it, go for  Taylor Davidson&#39;s (model #6) or  Alexander Jarvis&#39; (models #7/#8). They are by far the best stuff on the market today.\n     If you want to experience the future of financial modeling, go for  Summit (model #11) or  Causal (model #12) - while keeping in mind that both are very different.\n    Thanks for reading. Don&#39;t hesitate to leave a question in the comments, I try to reply personally to each one of them.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 05:37:11", "tags": "\u8d22\u52a1,financial,\u6a21\u578b,model",

Individuals, including directors, have the potential to become liable, as well.\n  Many popular CARES Act funding programs \u2014like the PPP and EIDL programs \u2014require an applicant company to make eligibility certifications. For example, the PPP loans require a certification that \u201cthe uncertainty of current economic conditions makes necessary the loan request to support the ongoing operations of the eligible recipient. \u201dThe SBA further clarified that \u201cBorrowers must . . . [take] into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity  ...\n  VB Transform 2020 Online - July 15-17, 2020: Join leading AI executives at VentureBeat&#39;s AI event of the year.  Register today and save 30% off digital access passes.\n There has obviously been a spate of news stories about well-resourced companies obtaining PPP funding (e.g. Ruth\u2019s Chris, Shake Shack). But in the  VC and startup community, clients are questioning whether a VC-backed startup really \u201cneeds \u201dthe money. This isn \u2019t just a moral question. Given the certification described  ...\n  What happens if a company makes false certifications to obtain CARES Act stimulus funding? The answer is found under the False Claims Act.\n The False Claims Act provides for civil and criminal liability for \u201cknowingly\u201d submitting a false claim to the federal government \u2014 including a request for a government loan.\n Merely submitting a false claim is not enough. It must be \u201cknowingly\u201d false. But there need not be a specific intent to defraud.\n False Claims Act liability arising from the CARES Act is not just a theoretical concern. The Department of Justice has already issued  a press release asserting that it will be prioritizing investigations of COVID-19 related fraud. So, attention and resources are being put into ferreting out CARES Act fraud.\n The government isn\u2019t the only one that can sue you for a false claim\n It\u2019s not only the government that one needs to worry about. A member of the public can stand in the government\u2019s shoes and file a suit under the False Claims Act. This is called a  qui tam action.\n Why would someone bring a qui tam claim under the False Claims Act? Because it can be worth a lot of money. A private plaintiff in a qui tam action may be able to keep up to 30% of the recovery in the lawsuit, plus an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The rest of the recovery goes to the government.\n The plaintiff\u2019s bar has already started advertising for whistleblowers to come forward for the obvious purpose of bringing a slew of qui tam actions under the CARES Act.\n  The False Claims Act doesn\u2019t limit liability to just the applicant company. It can extend to directors as well as investors.\n And remember \u2014 lots of startups are cash poor. Investors, however, are often not. Thus, VCs and other investors make attractive targets with big pockets for plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers seeking to file qui tam actions.\n Let\u2019s focus on two important aspects of False Claims Act liability for VCs and other investors.\n First, is the notion of \u201csubmitting\u201d a false claim. You might think that given the potential liability an investor faces when a startup seeks CARES Act funding that the best thing to do is to insert yourself in the process. This might not have the desired result.\n You are not automatically liable under the False Claims Act just because the company becomes liable. In fact, knowledge of the company submitting a false claim isn \u2019t even enough to impose personal liability. Rather, the individual must have taken some affirmative steps to cause the company to submit the  ...\n This has different implications for VCs themselves vs. directors who may be appointed by a VC.\n Investors are not generally expected to have any role in deciding whether to seek government funding. So, from a liability avoidance perspective, there is a strong case to be made to stay out of it.\n For investor directors, it is more difficult to close your eyes and let the company do what it wants to do. That can raise fiduciary duty concerns. But the job of a director is to make sure the company has policies and procedures in place for the officers to make decisions on government funding, not to  ...\n Second, there is the knowledge element of a False Claims Act claim. The False Claims Act is not a strict liability statute, nor does it seek to punish negligence. To be liable, the government (or a private plaintiff in the government\u2019s shoes) must show that the defendant acted \u201cknowingly.\u201d\n As an investor director, you want to make sure you can demonstrate, at a minimum, that you have acted reasonably and in good faith. In that regard, documentation is always recommended.\n In addition, make sure you are consulting with legal counsel in ensuring compliance with federal funding requirements. This is a particularly key when dealing with facing potential False Claims Act litigation. Reliance on advice of counsel can be, in itself, a defense to a claim that you violated the  ...\n  For many investors, this guidance may be seen as coming too late \u2014 their portfolio companies already obtained stimulus loans when perhaps they weren\u2019t really eligible. Thankfully, the SBA has provided a solution.\n Any company that has received a PPP loan can return the loan in full by May 7, 2020. This safe harbor will allow companies to avoid liability for having obtained a loan when they were potentially ineligible.\n Mital Makadia and David Siegel are partners at  Grellas Shah LLP, where

It\u2019s easy to throw stones after an event that \u201cno one could have foreseen\u201d.\n OK, then today I\u2019d like to do some  Sunday morning quarterbacking. I\u2019d like to ask you guys whether we are prepared for other black swans. Let\u2019s start with a collapse of the electrical system due to solar flares or electromagnetic pulse attacks.\n   In testimony before a Congressional Committee, it has been asserted that a prolonged collapse of this nation\u2019s electrical grid\u2014through starvation, disease, and societal collapse\u2014could result in the death of up to 90% of the American population.\n Well that caught my attention. It sounds worse than being cooped up for a few months watching lots of Netflix films.\n HV transformers are the weak link in the system, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has identified 30 of these as being critical. The simultaneous loss of just 9, in various combinations, could cripple the network and lead to a cascading failure, resulting in a \u201ccoast-to coast blackout\u201d.\n If the HV transformers are irreparably damaged it is problematic whether they can be replaced. The great majority of these units are custom built. The lead time between order and delivery for a domestically manufactured HV transformer is between 12 and 24\u2009months, and this is under benign, low demand conditions.\n OK, I think I understand what needs to be done\u2014stockpile some of these transformers that cannot be quickly replaced.\n Ordered today, delivery of a unit from overseas (responsible for 85% of current American purchasing) would take nearly 3\u2009years. The factory price for an HV transformer can be in excess of $10 million\u2014too expensive to maintain an inventory solely as spares for emergency replacement.\n Yes, $300 million dollars for a stockpile of 30 HV transformers is far too expensive to prevent 90% of the public dying and the rest reduced to cannibalism.\u00a0 Too much for a government that spends  trillions of dollars with about as much care as a drunken sailor spending his wages in a red light district.\u00a0 Instead, let\u2019s buy another    F-22 jet fighter.\n  Obviously I\u2019m no expert here, and I expect commenters will tell me why I\u2019m wrong.\u00a0 Perhaps the very same commenters who told me that I was foolish to think that surgical masks would provide any protection.\n BTW, this isn\u2019t one of those once in 60 million year events like dinosaur-killing asteroids; a huge solar flare hit Earth in 1859.\n Update:\u00a0 I forget to mention that I\u2019m far more worried about accidental

"note_en": "This past week \u2019s horrific announcement from the UN \u2019s World Food Program that up to 250 million people may be facing starvation from the economic impact of COVID-19 should permanently change the conversation about the pandemic. Up to now, we \u2019ve looked to scientists for guidance. Our public health experts have told us we need to shut down social, community and economic life to win this battle. Now as the pressure grows to resume normal life, many insist we wait for experts to give us a scientific  ...\n Beginning in January, epidemiologists began warning of a pandemic which, left unchecked, could lead to millions of deaths around the world. They were right and their warning was an invaluable service to society. Unfortunately, many of these experts have been since asked to make recommendations that ranged well beyond their area of expertise.\n While quarantines of the infected have long been an effective means of impeding disease, shutting down the healthy \u2014and the global economy \u2014at this scale is utterly unprecedented. It is the equivalent of prescribing to the entire population a highly toxic untested drug with massive side effects. Epidemiologists know viruses, but have no special expertise in agriculture, supply chains, labor markets, fiscal policy, social fabric, mental health, education, family relations, national security, or  ...\n The highly influential Imperial College\u2019s report \u2014 briefly \u2014 acknowledged these obvious limitations. Yes, proposed shutdown will entail \u201c enormoussocial and economic costs \u201dwhich may themselves create \u201csignificant impact on health and well-being. \u201dBut since the report \u2019s authors had no capacity to measure these potentially overwhelming costs, they ignored them. Science may not have to worry about trade-offs, but policy \u2014and health care \u2014always does: to save the village, we must first be careful  ...\n As the world watched the terrifying impact of COVID-19 on northern Italy in March, the pressure to do something big was inevitable. But the shutdown of major economies itself has been a worldwide calamity of historic proportions. Education, social, and cultural life have essentially stopped. In the US alone, 26 million people have lost their livelihoods and millions of families are seeing their fragile financial security imperiled \u2014a level in line with the Great Depression. The long-term impact  ...\n Despite the massive human costs of the shutdown \u2014 and a better if still very incomplete understanding of the virus \u2014 public health experts keep doubling down on their initial strategy. Several experts have warned that we may need to continue shutdowns \u2014 turned on and off like a spigot \u2014 for years.\n It \u2019s bizarre: this highly toxic drug that was considered unavoidable when epidemiologists worried about COVID-19 case fatality rates of 2 \u20133% is somehow equally unavoidable even though the range now looks more like 0.5 \u20131.0%. Alternative targeted mitigation ideas initially considered impractical \u2014such as quarantining the most vulnerable and focusing resources on nursing homes \u2014are somehow still impractical even though it \u2019s now clear deaths are heavily concentrated, and that society is willing  ...\n Our news media \u2014and the echo chamber of social media \u2014has been fully bought in to apocalyptic estimates and only one plausible \u201cscientific \u201dsolution. No anchor dares mention that this pandemic is likely to increase US deaths in 2020 by less than 4%. Presumably, reporters know that the chance of a healthy person dying from this virus is very small \u2014yet grim analysts insist that standing only five feet apart, walking your dog, or going to vote is \u201crisking death. \u201dPundits revel in false dichotomies:  ...\n All this has proven very good for TV ratings. But it\u2019s been terrible for helping the public understand the relative risks of this pandemic.\n Proponents are so bought into shutdown that they seem to have forgotten its original rationale. Shutdown was designed to \u201cflatten the curve, \u201dspreading infections over a long enough time period to prevent surge demand at any time on the health care system. Shutdown was intended to defer some of the pain of the pandemic, not eliminate it. An alternative strategy of encouraging rapid herd immunity accepts the risks of worse short-term results in hopes of a quicker end to the pandemic. By definition,  ...\n Developments have undermined the very premise of shutdown: to save the lives of COVID-19 sufferers by limiting surge demand on the health care system. Taking nothing away from the bravery and commitment of health care professionals, we now realize medical care has only limited ability to reduce COVID-19 deaths. Even worse, the shutdown is harming the tens of millions unable to get effective treatment for non-COVID conditions, and by decimating revenue, likely causing long-term damage to  ...\n In the media, shutdown has somehow morphed from a temporary, emergency response into a long-lasting bridge to an \u201call-clear \u201dHollywood ending. Public health experts who should know better haven \u2019t used their platforms to discourage such magical thinking. Perhaps, if we wait, we \u2019ll see a medical treatment for those with severe symptoms. Or an effective vaccine. Currently, the hope is that a broader testing regime will allow for a phased re-opening. Any of those would be great developments,  ...\n We will end the shutdown not because the virus is no longer a threat; we will end it because we can \u2019t continue such toxic treatment. Of course, ending the shutdown will increase risk of infections growing again, but that itself isn \u2019t a sufficient reason to maintain our current policy. As individuals, we make trade-offs between life and mortality every day, in our eating and exercising habits, our career decisions, our choices of fun. Half of us don \u2019t get flu shots each year, and that  ...\n It may be years before we can make a judgement on the overall wisdom of shutdown as our initial tool for attacking this virus. But whatever the strategy\u2019s theoretical merits, it is unsustainable and unrealistic among actual human beings.\n So, what should our public health experts do to treat the patient and not just the virus? First, they can encourage us to maintain the many social distancing techniques short of suppression that individuals and communities can use to reduce transmission. Second, as our knowledge of this virus and its transmission evolves, they can be creative about finding more targeted mitigation approaches. This requires opening up debate on alternatives with an eye to finding acceptable trade-offs,  ...\n Most importantly as we end these unsustainable shutdowns, our experts can give us perspective. Even though we don \u2019t have a way to end this pandemic today, we will almost certainly develop better public health and medical interventions. These innovations take experimentation and time, and we \u2019re more likely to find them if we don \u2019t simultaneously burden ourselves with massive economic and social problems. COVID-19 is likely to be with us for a while and it will be painful.

"note_en": "A U.S. district judge in the District of Columbia\u00a0 signed off on a historic settlement Thursday, putting an end to 8-year-old litigation between the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Facebook.\n The FTC  sued Facebook back in 2012 over eight privacy violations, saying that Facebook made deceptive claims about users\u2019 ability to control their personal data. The FTC alleged that Facebook misled its users into using default settings that weren\u2019t nearly as private as users believed they were. Also in 2012, Facebook was ordered to make remedial changes; then, it allegedly violated that order \u2013 which resulted in yet more litigation with the FTC.\n To settle the current litigation, Facebook agreed that it would not make misrepresentations about data security and would implement a new privacy program. The settlement also obligates Facebook to pay $5 billion in civil penalties; that penalty is significantly larger than the next-closest penalty the FTC has ever won\u2013which topped out at $22.5 million.\n The new finalized settlement between Facebook and the FTC is the product of lengthy netotiations between the parties \u2013 but still required court approval to take effect. As with all similar settlements, the court must declare the settlement fair, reasonable, and in the public interest \u2013 a relatively low bar.\u00a0But Judge  Timothy Kellywasn \u2019t as passive and detached as many judges are when approving a settlement. Kelly served up some harsh words for Facebook, warning the social media giant not  ...\n \u201dIn the Court\u2019s view, the unscrupulous way in which the United States alleges Facebook violated both the law and the administrative order is stunning,\u201d Kelly wrote. The judge\u2019s recitations of those allegations at length were not kind to Facebook:\n The allegations in the Complaint reflect many ways in which Facebook purportedly acted improperly. Some of these allegations represent discrete and poorly considered decisions, such as allegedly encouraging users to provide phone numbers to better secure their accounts, but then using those same numbers for advertising without telling users beforehand. Others appear to reflect Facebook \u2019s willingness to deceive its users outright, such as allegedly telling the public that it would not share  ...\n Then came a stern warning:\u00a0\u201cIn the event that the parties return to this Court because the United States alleges\u2014once again\u2014that Facebook has reneged on its promises and continued to violate the law or the terms of the amended administrative order, the Court may not apply quite the same deference to the terms of a proposed resolution.\n In other words, this had better be the end of Facebook\u2019s shenanigans, or the FTC won\u2019t be the only one to drop the hammer.\n But Kelly was also crystal clear that he thinks there are deeper problems that the legislative branch should considering solving.\n \u201cAnd these allegations, and the briefs of some amici, call into question the adequacy of laws governing how technology companies that collect and monetize Americans\u2019 personal information must treat that information. But those concerns are largely for Congress; they are not relevant here,\u201d the judge wrote.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 04:29:49", "tags": "facebook,\u6cd5\u5b98,judge", "title":

"note_en": "After 14 years running my own businesses, I \u2019ve failed a lot. I haven \u2019t kept count thankfully, but I \u2019d say I \u2019ve started at least 50 businesses / ideas and out of those, 3 have worked. And when I say worked I don \u2019t mean staying in business, I mean resulting in either a decent income for me at the time or a decent asset that \u2019s worth something to me or someone else. With all the risks you take as an entrepreneur, I don \u2019t see replacing your job and getting to work from home as a significant  ...\n The startup community likes to glorify failure but I don\u2019t. Failing sucks. Failing slow sucks infinitely more. That\u2019s why it\u2019s OK sometimes to give up, to free you up to move onto an idea that could bring you something that the startup community doesn\u2019t talk about near as much: actual fulfilment and success.\n  Knowing when to give up is near impossible and the emotional baggage that comes with making the decision to give up is unbearable. That\u2019s why entrepreneurs, myself included, waste years of their lives on shitty ideas that will never work, following the popular trend of \u201cideas don\u2019t matter, only execution matters\u201d.\n  Ideas matter a lot, and if yours is a shitty one, for you, at that time, with the resources you have, it will almost certainly fail.\n Here is a list of things to look out for when things might be set for failure. These are based on my failures and the failures I\u2019ve seen around my circles (mostly self-funded online business folk).\n  Being willing to go into something you are clueless about can be a great trait for an entrepreneur, but only to a point. Sometimes entrepreneurs overshoot, I \u2019ve done it myself. I started a business selling kids toys without any experience in retail or without knowing anything about kids, I tried to start a business making pot plant stands despite not being a gardener and having zero experience in manufacturing, I tried to build an app for surfers despite being a terrible surfer and having  ...\n If I think about the ideas that have worked for me, I\u2019ve been able to utilise a lot of my existing skills to make them work. And where my skills weren\u2019t enough, I\u2019ve worked with other skilled people as partners to pull it off.\n Over the years, I\u2019ve seen so many people try to start businesses, especially online businesses and apps etc without any clue what they are doing. Successful software startups are almost always started by well connected, super smart entrepreneurs in big startup hub cities, or people who are really great software engineers themselves. It\u2019s extremely rare for an individual who isn\u2019t a programmer to think up a software idea and turn that into a successful company.\n Yet people try all the time (myself included) and wonder why it doesn\u2019t work out. Your chances go up a lot when you stick with something you know extremely well, or at the very least have co-founders who know the field very well and your skills are equally valuable.\n  I used to do this all the time, with 4 or 5 ideas bubbling away at once all the time. Lots of people do the same thing. I think they heard some generic advice that said millionaires have on average 7 different income streams, and they think that means they have to have 7 businesses. I can tell you 1 great business is a hell of a lot more valuable than 7 shit ones. It\u2019s near impossible to split your time, attention and dedication across multiple projects.\n It\u2019s also very hard to avoid those entrepreneurial impulses, particularly when one project isn\u2019t going well, it\u2019s tempting to dabble in a few at once. But I claim at least temporary success at battling this impulse. I stopped doing it about 3 years ago.\n My last business suffered immensely because of this. Both me and my co-founder worked on multiple projects while running the business. In the end, none of our side projects did very well at all, and the approach took a toll on the main business.\n I took these lessons into my current (only) business  Black Hops Brewing. Once I started working full time at Black Hops, I shut down all of my other personal projects. One of them was generating $40-$50k a year in relatively passive income which was more than I was getting as a wage via Black Hops at the time. I switched it, and all of my projects off to focus on Black Hops.\n And it was the right decision. I haven\u2019t thought about any other projects since we started and Black Hops has grown into one of the countries fastest growing breweries and one of the state\u2019s largest independent breweries. Size wise it\u2019s already 6-7 times the revenue of my last business, and it\u2019s worth 8-10 times as much after less than 4 years.\n It pays to focus, especially if you really believe in the thing you are focusing on. Turning down lower value opportunities for higher value ones is something great entrepreneurs do all the time.\n  This might come across as harsh but have you had a really good think about whether you are the right person for this particular idea at this particular time? I think sometimes people look up to these outlier heroes who started amazing outlier companies and think they can do it as well. It\u2019s OK to have some ambition, but it has to be tempered with some level of self awareness.\n Steve Jobs famously said \u201cLife can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.\u201d This is a neat inspirational quote, but is it actually true?\n I\u2019m a reasonably smart person, when I went to school I was slightly above average for my school. I got a good enough grade to get into Business at university and went on to start a few of my own businesses. But what about all the kids that were smarter than me at school do?\n When I look around, I see amazing houses that were designed by Architects after acing school, getting through a gruelling 5 years at university, a further 2 years in monitored practice, passing the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia exam then probably worked under an amazing Architect with 20-30 years experience for 5 years at least before they designed the house I \u2019m looking at. The roads and the bridges and the buildings are the same, built by engineers who were  ...\n Businesses in many ways are not that much different. The successful restaurants are normally started by the industry \u2019s best and most award-winning chefs, software apps are created by some of the smartest entrepreneurs and software engineers in capital-rich startup hubs like Silicon Valley. Have you ever listened to an interview with any of the founders of any of the major tech giants of our generation? Zuckerberg is a computing genius, an insanely aggressive risk taker, he  ...\n Not to say there\u2019s no place for you and me in a world filled with access and enormous opportunity. But should we be trying to start the next Facebook? Probably not the right people for the job.\n  I \u2019ve noticed a lot of younger entrepreneurs have a strong social conscience, which is a great thing. But the idea of starting a charity of sorts that \u2019s also a business is a tricky one to get my head around. There are certainly examples of companies who have been started with a strong social conscience that have also been fantastic businesses. But for every one of those, there \u2019s way more companies that seem to make a lot of vague claims about donating a \u201c% of profit \u201dto  ...\n When I think about entrepreneurs who have given large amounts to causes, the ones I think of like Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos etc were all ridiculously successful business people first, and philanthropists later. Many, like Gates, were well known for being ruthlessly competitive, happily monopolising industries and obliterating competitors. These guys were hard entrepreneurs, driven by creating revolutionary products and making shitloads of money.\n And that \u2019s completely fine as far as I \u2019m concerned, that \u2019s what entrepreneurs are supposed to do. If you can build some good natured help for people in need into your business model (or more importantly your brand), then go for it. But it should be a business first. There is a lot of nobility in starting a business that entrepreneurs often don \u2019t get credit for. Small businesses power our economies, they support families, they employ tax paying citizens and they pay their  ...\n  Marketing is the biggest problem in business, I should know after failing marketing in Business School and failing at marketing in most of my businesses. Convincing anyone to do something different to what they are currently doing is near impossible. I know you know this, as business owners we know when we have a good product or service or event or app or restaurant, we look around at our competitors and size them up and feel like our offering is just as good if not better.  ...\n In my circles of mainly self funded smaller businesses, we don\u2019t have the big budgets to acquire customers with paid ad spend. Even if we could, we don\u2019t have the analytics to know if the money is well spent or not. Figuring all of that out is expensive and it takes time. So normally what we do is we build a nice brand and a nice story around what we do.\n In my case my last business I had this ongoing (very real) story about an entrepreneur who failed for 7 years and then started a neat little productised service business in 7 days.\n The fact that it was 7 years of failure and 7 days to success was pure luck. The fact that the entrepreneur was me was even luckier.\n The business would offer unlimited WordPress fixes for a fixed monthly fee, the first of its kind with this type of idea. It took off. My failure story turned into a success story, and me and my co-founder used that story and momentum to build a nice business which we sold to GoDaddy less than 3 years later.\n With my current business, it\u2019s a similar story (but way better). 3 guys sat around at a bar discussing brewing ideas, we decided to have a crack at one of the ideas and after realising it was a hit, we took the plunge and built our own brewery (with a lot of other cool shit happening along the way, which we happily accepted into  our story).\n In both causes we took our community and our audience along with us as we built the business, and we built the businesses while spending close to $0 on advertising.\n But this wasn\u2019t about us geniuses thinking up a cool story and using it as a branding exercise. We just happened to find ourselves inside a great story. We were of course very happy to use that and be part of it and make it the centrepiece of our marketing.\n For these 2 businesses I \u2019ve got enormous amounts of free marketing and publicity over the years. We \u2019ve had international attention from the likes of Activision (Call of Duty \u2019s first official beer), TechCrunch, Fox news, Mashable and more. We \u2019ve had local attention including featuring on an episode of a TV show on Channel 9, being on 9 News and 7 News and the Gold Coast Bulletin and the Courier Mail and more. None of that cost us a cent, and without that kind  ...\n But what if you don\u2019t have that luxury? What if you don\u2019t find yourself inside a great story. I guess you could make it up, an approach that makes me ill to think about, but a lot of companies do it and it works for some. But I like to think most consumers see through it. The more likely outcome is the business won\u2019t gain traction. You\u2019ll miss out on the easiest solution to businesses biggest problems.\n It\u2019s not great, but maybe it means you have to search out for an idea where you will find yourself inside a cool story.\n  One of the biggest traps for new entrepreneurs is they try to change the world too soon. They are inspired by entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk and they want to be \u2018disruptive\u2019 and \u2018make a dent in the universe\u2019.\n Being inspired is great and super important, I\u2019m also very inspired by these people and have been over many years. But trying to change too much is a struggle that most entrepreneurs aren\u2019t ready for.\n Can you imagine the gargantuan task of convincing people who have driven petrol cars all their life to no longer buy petrol cars? Can you imagine being a startup car maker and competing against iconic companies that people tie their identities to? Competing against companies who have more than a century of lessons and innovation and brand building to fall back on? You want people to ignore all of that and buy a golf buggy?\n That\u2019s what Elon faced when forming Tesla. It takes a special type of crazy person (meant in the most endearing way), to even think something like that would be possible.\n Elon made it happen with a shitload of money, a very healthy dose of luck, and because he\u2019s a once in a generation entrepreneur.\n Most people don\u2019t make this happen. Most good solid companies are started with a slight point of difference, a cool story, a good brand and a well timed offering. They won\u2019t drastically change people\u2019s buying behavior. This is especially true for underfunded entrepreneurs, who already have an enormous marketing challenge just to make people aware that they exist.\n As far as making people completely change their habits as a consumer? Good luck with that. Much better to provide a solution where customers are already paying for a solution.\n  At the risk of repeating everything I said in  The 7 Day Startup, it\u2019s a very bad idea to make decisions based on assumptions instead of actual customer data. A founder\u2019s only goal in starting a new business should be to get a viable product or service into the customers\u2019 hands as soon as possible.\n This is a roadblock that new entrepreneurs have a huge issue with. It\u2019s so much easier to just post a link in a Facebook group and ask for feedback, or jump on a mastermind call and discuss what hypothetically the customer might want.\n I don \u2019t want to downplay this mistake because it \u2019s an excruciatingly difficult challenge. It \u2019s not as simple as putting out a shit product and hoping for the best. Products have to be good (viable), if they don \u2019t look good and feel good and solve a proper problem and provide a different enough experience to what people are used to (without changing major behaviours), then they probably aren \u2019t viable. So how do you create something with all of those  ...\n But the alternative is pissing around for months, or years on \u2018potential \u2019ideas fabricating hypothetical scenarios in your head based on assumptions, that only delay the inevitable. Having customers tell you they hate your idea, or not pay for it, or even worse, not being able to find customers, really sucks. But there \u2019s something that sucks way harder. Spending months or years of your life on the wrong idea and ultimately having it fail. I \u2019ve done  ...\n  This one shouldn\u2019t come as a huge surprise, but there does have to be something interesting about your product or service offering. It doesn\u2019t have to be a major change, in fact massive changes could do a lot more harm than good, it just has to be worth talking about. When I look back at my failed ideas, they weren\u2019t particularly interesting. When I look at the few that have gone well, they\u2019ve all had some little point of difference.\n And the thing that is interesting has to be interesting to the customer, not just to you. This is why I think sometimes it\u2019s a bad idea for entrepreneurs to \u201cscratch their own itch\u201d. It\u2019s super easy to be interested in your own shit. It\u2019s way harder to get people to part with their money to purchase something that they were otherwise not planning on purchasing. There has to be something in your idea that is interesting to talk about.\n In my case my WordPress support business was the first of its kind to offer a monthly recurring fixed price service that was traditionally either invoiced hourly or quoted for larger jobs. It\u2019s not a massive change, I was doing WordPress support for years and years before WP Curve. But I\u2019d never done human services for a fixed monthly cost, and others in the industry hadn\u2019t done much of it either, and that idea was interesting.\n In the brewing world I can apply the same methodology. The brewers that have done well all have something interesting about what they are doing. Whether it\u2019s a cool founding story, excellent branding that grabs attention, or just awesome experimental beers that drive people to talk about them. The good ones are all doing something interesting.\n If what you are doing isn \u2019t especially interesting to your customers, it \u2019s going to be very difficult. And if you aren \u2019t sure, look at what your customers are saying about it. And I don \u2019t mean in reply for a testimonial request. Look at the words they use, how they use the product, how they say it \u2019s different, how excited about it are they. That will give you some hints, just be wary of people \u2019s tendency to support their friends and be excited  ...\n  Humans are constantly getting advice from their surroundings, and new entrepreneurs are so easily influenced it really worries me. I see and hear so much awful advice given out to entrepreneurs in Facebook groups, and in mentoring sessions, and from friends and family etc. New entrepreneurs take it all in.\n Fuck advice. You don\u2019t need it. You need awareness, and it\u2019s very difficult to cultivate, especially when you are a new entrepreneur.\n But since you are seeking some kind of advice (otherwise why would you be reading this), here\u2019s my advice on taking advice:\n If you need advice, give a lot of thought to why. Are you not qualified to do this? Do you not have enough expertise in your founding team? Do you not have the courage to make your own decisions? Do you want to seek permission from someone?\n  Try to avoid taking business advice from people who say they are experts. People who are good at business, spend their time running their businesses, not \u201ceducating\u201d others on how to run theirs.\n Look for category-specific advice. If you find someone who is epic at email marketing, it makes sense to get some advice on that topic, but don\u2019t hero worship someone into thinking they are a suitable person to give you advice on all topics.\n Don\u2019t take the approach of asking questions and taking the answer as a solution. Instead gather data and be an entrepreneur and make your own decisions. The best places to gather data is to talk with your team or co-founders (if you have them), or talk to or observe your customers interacting with your offering.\n Do what feels right, sorry I can\u2019t do better than that but if it feels right it probably is.\n  Firstly thanks for reading this article. Is your business likely to fail? I don\u2019t know, only you can know that but I hope these thoughts help you with that decision. And while I don\u2019t want to glorify failure, moving from an idea that doesn\u2019t work for you to one that does is a beautiful thing. It\u2019s a scary move, but maybe it\u2019s the right move.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 04:29:34", "tags": "\u5546\u4e1a,\u60f3\u6cd5,business", "title":

"note_en": "A rising international force of rebel botanists armed with chalk has taken up street graffiti to highlight the names and importance of the diverse but downtrodden flora growing in the cracks of paths and walls in towns and cities across Europe.  The idea of naming wild plants wherever they go \u2013 which began in France \u2013 has gone viral, with people chalking and sharing their images on social media. More than 127,000 people have  liked a photo of chalked-up tree names in a London suburb, while a  video  ...\n  Presseq told the Guardian: \u201cI wanted to raise awareness of the presence, knowledge and respect of these wild plants on sidewalks. People who had never taken the time to observe these plants now tell me their view has changed. Schools have contacted me since to work with students on nature in the city.\u201d\n France banned pesticide use in parks, streets and other public spaces in 2017 and in gardens from 2019, leading to a surge in awareness of urban wild flowers in the country.\n French botanist and campaigner Sophie Leguil, who lives in London, set up the  More Than Weeds campaign to change perceptions of urban plants in the UK after helping to spread the  Sauvages de  ma rue (\u201cwild things of my street\u201d) chalking campaign in France led by  Tela Botanica. She has won permission to chalk up Hackney\u2019s highways and make chalk trails to highlight the forgotten flora at our feet and is asking other councils to allow the same.\n This week, the Guardian&#39;s Age of Extinction site is looking at biodiversity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.\n Around 55% of the world \u2019s population live in urban areas and that number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. Nature \u2019s role in the wellbeing and happiness of billions of people will be more important than ever. While urbanisation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, many conservationists and town planners are trying to make built-up areas more nature-friendly. The role of green spaces in urban areas has even been formalised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss,  ...\n The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.\n In this special series of reports we&#39;ll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.\n \u201cThe pesticide ban in France has played a major role as it has forced local authorities and mentalities to change, and raised awareness,\u201d said Leguil.\n \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do it on a larger scale, with permission, and I hope to get more authorities interested in creating trails. We talk a lot about plant blindness \u2013 what if putting names on plants could make people look at them in a different way? I despair at how sanitised London has become.  Plants can be managed differently, with benefits \u2013 cost-saving, biodiversity, education.\u201d\n  In the UK it is illegal to chalk anything \u2013 hopscotch, art or botanical names \u2013 on paths or highways without permission, even if it educates, celebrates and fosters interest and knowledge in nature.\n One anonymous London tree name chalker said: \u201cI\u2019ll keep labelling as I go on my daily walks. I think it\u2019s really tapped into where people are right now.\n \u201cBotanical chalking gives a quick blast of nature connection, as the words encourage you to look up and notice the tree above you, the leaves, the bark, the insects, the sky. And that\u2019s all good for mental health. None of us can manage that much \u2013 living through a global pandemic is quite enough to be getting on with. But it\u2019s brought me a great amount of joy.\u201d\n  UK Plantlife spokesman Trevor Dines said the charity could not condone breaking the law, but added: \u201cThe incredible response to graffiti plant names is astonishing and I think it\u2019s part of something profound. It\u2019s as if the plant is declaring its own place in  our world.\n \u201cIn a recent YouGov poll, just 6% of 16- to 24-year-olds were able to correctly name a picture of a wild violet. The same poll showed nearly 70% of respondents would like to be able to identify more wild flowers.\u201d\n  With less spraying and weeding, we might expect to see up to 400 plant species on walls and paths, he suggests. That is 10% of our wild flora richness.\n \u201cOne survey of pavements in Sheffield found 183 different plants, another in Cambridge found 186 species on walls. All these little micro niches build up to a wonderfully complex tapestry,\u201d Dines said.\n \u201cEvery flower counts and will be targeted by pollinators \u2013 a patch of nettles can be swamped with caterpillars. And bird\u2019s-foot-trefoil, a not uncommon urban verge plant, is a food plant for more than 160 different invertebrates. If we change our perceptions and see the dandelion flower for what it is \u2013 an absolute lifeline to our bees in early spring \u2013 we might learn to love them more.\u201d\n A  study by pollinator researchersrevealed that many wild urban \u201cweeds \u201drank very highly for the quantity of nectar and pollen each flower provides, often much higher than a variety of garden plants. The top trumps among the plants they measured included dandelions and their lookalikes \u2013rough hawkbit, cat \u2019s-ear and sow-thistles \u2013plus ragwort, viper \u2019s bugloss, mallows, self-heal, scentless mayweed, love-in-a-mist, wild mignonette, rosebay willowherb, thistles, creeping buttercup and  ...\n  Andrew Whitehouse, of conservation trust Buglife, said path and wall plants are also important as winter food sources when there is less blossom available for insects such as bumblebees. \u201cBelow the concrete, the roots create tiny microhabitats that support woodlice, worms, harvestmen, spiders, baby slugs and snails, which in turn become the food for birds and hedgehogs,\u201d he added.\n Cllr Jon Burke, of Hackney Council, which has gone  pesticide-free in some areasand halved its use overall to increase wild flowers and boost insect biodiversity following public concern, said: \u201cIt is absurd that this chalking of plant names is criminal. It is something we welcome as an important and inspiring teaching tool for adults and children. How else will a kid ever know these names? The vocabulary of the natural world helps us access it, love it and desire to protect it. \u201d ...\n Criminal law expert James Gray of Drystone Chambers confirmed that chalking plant names in the UK is illegal without permission or \u201clawful excuse\u201d and a rebel botanist could be fined up to \u00a32,500 for painting or inscribing any picture, letter, sign, or other mark on a path, highway surface, tree or other structure.\n  Referring to Victor Hugo\u2019s famous fictional police inspector, Gray added: \u201cThe Javerts of this world will see great harm in the scribbles of rogue botanists and call for prosecutions, others will see it as entirely harmless and perhaps even a refreshing diversion in our streets.\u201d\n  He added: \u201cWhere the threshold lies will depend on the attitude of those charged with enforcing the law; beauty (or derangement) is in the eye of the magistrate.\u201d\n Find more  age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters  Phoebe Weston and  Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features", "posttime": "2020-05-04 04:07:31", "tags": "\u690d\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6,botanists,\u690d\u7269,wild", "title": "\u53cd\u53db\u7684\u690d\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6\u6b63\u5728\u7528\u6d82\u9e26\u6765\u547d\u540d\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u690d\u7269\u7fa4\u3002", "title_en": "Rebel botanists are using graffiti to name forgotten flora", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/not-just-weeds-how-rebel-botanists-are-using-graffiti-to-name-forgotten-flora-aoe", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u690d\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6", "botanists", "\u690d\u7269", "wild"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000520, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8981\u7ee7\u7eed\uff0c\u8bf7\u5355\u51fb\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u6846\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u4e0d\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\n\u8bf7\u786e\u4fdd\u60a8\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u652f\u6301JavaScript\u548cCookie\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u60a8\u6ca1\u6709\u963b\u6b62\u5b83\u4eec\u52a0\u8f7d\u3002\u6709\u5173\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u548c\u3002", "note_en": "To continue, please click the box below to let us know you&#39;re not a robot.\n  Please make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not blocking them from loading.

"note_en": "Two weeks into the first Wall Street earnings season that includes COVID-19 data, most big tech companies that operate a large cloud unit have reported results. Judging from the growth rate and revenue numbers alone, the cloud seems to be weathering the coronavirus storm just fine. AWS grew 33% year-over-year and  hit the $10 billion USD quarterly revenue mark for the first time. Azure  grew by 59%, Google Cloud (includes both GCP and GSuite)  grew by 52%, and IBM \u2019s Cloud &amp; Data Platforms category  ...\n But as a full-fledged industry, the cloud is relatively new, even though cloud computing as a form factor and product has been around for more than two decades now.  Loudcloud (later Opsware) and  Rackspace were both founded before the dot com boom busted. AWS  was launched in 2006 with S3, SQS (Simple Queue Service), and EC2.\n The current COVID-19-induced recession, if not depression, will be the first time the cloud computing industry is a meaningful participant of a large-scale economic downturn.\n  (NOTE: in this post, \u201ccloud\u201d means either infrastructure or platform-as-a-service, IaaS or PaaS. It does not include cloud-based SaaS products, where there are too many types and variations.)\n  Before we dive into the analysis, let\u2019s establish some common definitions and a framework first.\n  Wall Street&#39;s somewhat technical financial definition is anything that has a negative beta. In plain terms, it means any security whose price movement is opposite of the stock market\u2019s; if the market goes up, that security goes down, and vice-versa. Gold and U.S. Treasury bonds are the classic examples. Bitcoin is the more edgy, less understood example.\n There\u2019s also a more Main Street way to think about what is recession-proof. It\u2019s anything that people must spend money on, regardless of how bad the economy is and how bad their personal financial situation is. Typically, that means things like utilities (electricity and water), car insurance, and essential consumer products like food and toothpaste.\n Of course, these are all heuristics that do not reflect reality completely. One common heuristic is that alcohol consumption is recession-proof. (You\u2019d want to get drunk when things are good and when things are bad.) However, certain academic study has shown that alcohol consumption  actually decreased during the 2008 Great Recession.\n So how should we evaluate the cloud\u2019s recession-proof-ness? Investopedia\u2019s  five characteristics of a recession-resistant company seems to be a reasonable framework for this exercise, if we imagine each cloud platform to be an independent company. You are a recession-resistant company, if you have  one of the following characteristics:\n  Let\u2019s see if a cloud platform would have one or more of these characteristics.\n  Not really.If anything, cloud platforms are more the consumer of these critical repair services. Given the increasing criticality of the cloud infrastructure to the essential functions of our society, the businesses that do serve the cloud infrastructure, e.g. server and network maintenance, physical security of data centers, etc., may be more recession proof than the cloud itself. Regardless of which cloud is more in demand, and even if the whole industry experiences a categorical  ...\n  No. Certain cloud vendors may be the infrastructure that support the stores that  do sell consumer essentials. Obviously, AWS itself is now the foundation to Amazon.com that  is selling and delivering many of the consumer essentials. But most consumers don\u2019t know, or care, if their essential shopping is happening in the cloud or not. And in an apocalyptic scenario where the entire Internet economy collapses, people will adap and buy essential goods from brick and mortar options.\n  Probably yes. The customer base of the cloud is broad and diverse, from startups, to larger enterprises from all industries, to governments of all levels and sizes. While some of those customers will suffer during a recession, others will be more in demand for different reasons. Projecting into the future of our current recession, travel companies and airlines won \u2019t be using as much cloud, but Zoom, Slack, and other products used for remote work will use more. Many startups and SMBs  ...\n  Not really. Using the cloud may be a good idea for many businesses, but it\u2019s not border or custom control, financial audits of public companies, or oil pipelines inspection. This category of recession proof services are typically attached to specific laws or regulations that require they happen regularly, no matter what\u2019s happening to the economy. Using the cloud is a business choice, by no means a requirement or mandate.\n  Quite possibly. This is a tricky one. What happens on a cloud platform is powered by a mixture of open source and proprietary technology. Some of the data center designs are open sourced as a part of the Open Compute Project. Most of the hardwares is acquired from vendors selling proprietary technologies. Most of the fundamental software components are open sourced at their core, but tied together with proprietary code that works differently in one cloud versus another. The core  ...\n  If you don\u2019t find this analysis unsatisfying, you are not alone. I\u2019m not either. (And if you came to this post looking for recession proof stock picks, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you.) There isn\u2019t an established category of recession proof businesses that fully captures all dimensions of the cloud industry.\n The cloud is part utilities, part commercial real estate, part railroad, and part something new that warrants its own framework.  (I welcome your input to develop a better analytical framework together.)\n There are also few data points that can help us understand and model how cloud platforms will perform during a recession. This COVID-19 recession will be the first one.\n Lastly, even if we do have a framework and enough information to establish that cloud platforms are indeed recession proof, it\u2019s hard to invest in them in a targeted way. All the big cloud vendors are parts of bigger tech conglomerates. And the financials around their cloud units are inconsistent and convoluted -- Microsoft, Google, IBM, Oracle all have their own definition and \u201cspin\u201d on what should be considered \u201ccloud\u201d, which is  a point of frustration I\u2019ve written about  many  ...\n Until Amazon decides to break AWS away into a separate entity, or when a cloud startup like  Digital Ocean eventually go public, just investing in cloud computing platforms in the public market is difficult. The best you can do is invest in one of the big tech companies with a cloud or a data center colocation company like Equinix.\n All the dissatisfactions aside, how the entire cloud industry will fare during this current crisis is worth watching and learning from, if only to prepare for the next recession. And there will be another recession.\n If you like what you&#39;ve read, please  SUBSCRIBE to the Interconnected email list. New posts will be delivered to your inbox (twice per week).

"note_en": "The median price paid for an existing, single-family home in the Bay Area fell in 2019 for the first full year since 2011, according to data from the California Association of Realtors.\n  The median price, the point at which half of homes sold for more and half for less, fell to $928,000, down 2.3% from $950,000 in 2018.\n  Forces pushing prices up \u2014 the region\u2019s booming economy, chronic housing shortage and a hotly anticipated flood of initial public offerings \u2014 were offset by negative factors, including strained affordability, outmigration to cheaper locales and shrinking federal tax breaks for homeownership.\n  The association\u2019s numbers do not include condominiums, new construction and homes that were not entered into a multiple listing service.\n  Of the nine Bay Area counties, Santa Clara had the biggest price drop, 5.6%. However, it had been the strongest the year before, rising 13.5%, said Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst with Compass, a real estate brokerage.\n  Oakland-Berkeley was the strongest submarket last year, attracting buyers seeking an \u201curban ambience\u201d at a lower cost than San Francisco, he said.\n  Abio Properties agent Shannon Prokup was stunned when a home she listed on Ashby Avenue in Berkeley attracted more than 400 people at open houses last Saturday and Sunday. The home has two bedrooms, one bathroom and 1,100 square feet; it is priced at $825,000. \u201cI was not expecting that kind of turnout,\u201d she said. But \u201cthere is not a ton on the market under a million dollars. And interest rates are still low.\u201d\n  Prices in all of Alameda County, however, fell 2.1% last year. Prices were also down in Marin, San Mateo and Sonoma counties but up slightly in Contra Costa, Napa and Solano counties. San Francisco\u2019s median price, $1.6 million, was dead even with 2018.\n  The median price in San Francisco hit a high in the second quarter of 2019, \u201cprobably driven by IPO hype,\u201d Carlisle said.\n     A string of large San Francisco companies went public, starting with Levi Strauss and Lyft in March, Pinterest in April, Uber in May and Slack in June. Most employees of these companies, except for Slack, which sold shares in a direct listing, were prohibited from selling their shares for up to six months.\n  In March and April, \u201cA bunch of people said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to sell now, I\u2019ll wait until the millionaires come out.\u2019 Then there were buyers who said, \u2018We need to buy now before we are competing with all these millionaires,\u2019\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cThe second quarter got exacerbated by the sellers waiting for the millionaires and buyers trying to beat millionaires to the market.\u201d\n  And it wasn\u2019t just in San Francisco. \u201cThe rush happened before everything went IPO,\u201d said Linnette Edwards, co-founder of Abio Properties in the East Bay. \u201cI had buyers who were adamant about buying before the IPOs,\u201d including one couple that was expecting a baby. \u201cThey called it baby IPO,\u201d she said.\n     Jason Buttorf, a Compass agent in San Francisco, had a client who works for Slack. He and his wife had been renting in Golden Gate Heights and eyeing homes there for years. In July, shortly after Slack went public, their \u201cdream home\u201d came on the market and they snapped it up for over $2.5 million.\n  By the time fall rolled around, however, the market \u201cwas mysteriously quiet and uneventful,\u201d Buttorf said.\n  Carlisle agreed. \u201cThe hype might have affected (the market) more than the reality,\u201d he said.\n  Prices typically peak in the spring and summer and decline in the fall and winter. On a year-over-year basis, Bay Area home prices did better in the second half than the first, largely because interest rates declined, said Jordan Levine, the Realtor association\u2019s deputy chief economist.\n  But there\u2019s no doubt that the market has cooled. The median price paid for a single-family existing home in the Bay Area fell from $727,000 in 2006 to $430,000 in 2009. It rose to $500,000 in 2010 (thanks in part to a first-time home buyer credit), then dropped again in 2011, to $460,000. After that it embarked on a string of stratospheric increases that brought it to $950,000 in 2018.\n  \u201cAs the economy picked up, home prices in the Bay Area, where the economy was outperforming the state and nation, bounced back very quickly,\u201d Levine said. \u201cAs prices have risen, affordability has become more of a problem, which limits some price appreciation.\u201d\n  Federal tax changes that took effect in 2018 have also \u201cincreased the cost of homeownership compared to what it was in the past,\u201d he added. Congress reduced the mortgage interest deduction on loans originated after 2017 to interest on $750,000 in debt, down from $1 million. It also capped the previously unlimited deduction for all state and local taxes combined, including income and property taxes, at $10,000.\n  \u201cYou are seeing that play a role, particularly in the Bay Area, where most homeowners are going to be impacted by those caps,\u201d Levine said. But, he added, you can\u2019t blame it all on tax changes. \u201cWe have seen the pace of growth slowing for several years.\u201d\n  For the month of December only, the median price paid for a single-family, existing home in the Bay Area was $908,750, down 1.8% from November but up 6.9% from December 2018, according to numbers  released Friday by the Realtors association.\n  \u201cDecember and January are almost always the lowest prices of the year,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cThe whole market is seasonal but the luxury market is fiercely seasonal.\u201d High-end sellers leave for the holidays and take their homes off the market, assuming high-end buyers have also left. As a result, the market gets dominated by lower-end sales, which pulls down the median price.\n  The median price paid for a single-family home in San Francisco fell to $1.45 million in December, down 10.4% from November and down 3.3% from December 2018. That was the worst showing of any Bay Area county.\n  On a year-over-year basis, the December median price was up 3.7% in Alameda County, 8.6% in Contra Costa, 2.3% in Marin, 5.5% in Napa, 6.5% in Santa Clara, 7.2% in Solano and 1.3% in Sonoma. It fell 0.5% in San Mateo.\n  For the state as a whole, Levine predicts that low interest rates will continue to bolster buyer demand but shrinking inventories will keep sales from rising more than 1% or 2% this year. \u201cWe see price growth in the mid-single-digit range.\u201d\n  Whether the Bay Area does better or worse than the state \u201cis a tough call,\u201d he said. The Bay Area \u201chas upward momentum from the demand side,\u201d as job growth keeps unemployment near record lows. But the inventory shortage is even more acute in the Bay Area, \u201cwhich is spilling over to the demand side,\u201d with people leaving the area in search of cheaper housing.\n  Kathleen Pender writes the Net Worth column in The San Francisco Chronicle.

Pender welcomes questions from readers and frequently answers them in her column.\n She majored in business journalism at the University of Missouri-Columbia and was a Knight-Bagehot fellow in business journalism at Columbia University.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 03:22:25", "tags": "\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71,\u6e7e\u533a,\u623f\u4ef7,area,\u4ef7\u683c", "title": "\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u6e7e\u533a\u623f\u4ef7\u4e2d\u503c\u81ea2011\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u9996\u6b21\u5e74\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d", "title_en": "Bay Area median home price first annual drop since 2011", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/networth/article/Bay-Area-median-home-price-fell-2-3-last-year-14985353.php", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71", "\u6e7e\u533a", "\u623f\u4ef7", "area", "\u4ef7\u683c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000516, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6b21\u8981\u7248\u672c\u662f\u4f7fLibrePCB\u529f\u80fd\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u53c8\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\n\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f7f\u521b\u5efa\u5e93\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u539f\u7406\u56fe\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u548c\u7535\u8def\u677f\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u73b0\u5728\u5206\u522b\u5141\u8bb8\u641c\u7d22\u7b26\u53f7\u3002\u8bbe\u5907(#671)\uff1a\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u957f\u5ea6\u503c(\u7ebf\u5bbd\u3001\u94bb\u5b54\u76f4\u5f84\u3001\u5750\u6807\u7b49)\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u5b57\u6bb5\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u663e\u793a\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5355\u5143\u4e2d(#684)\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u57df\u7684\u5355\u4f4d\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u5355\u72ec\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u6062\u590d\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u5b66\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u9644\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4f4d(\u4f8b\u5982\u201cmm\u201d)\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5bf9\u5176\u6c42\u503c\uff1a\n\u6b64\u7248\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u62fe\u53d6\u4e0e\u653e\u7f6eCSV\u6587\u4ef6\u5bfc\u51fa(#639)\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64LibrePCB\u73b0\u5728\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c06\u7531\u62fe\u53d6\u4e0e\u653e\u7f6e\u673a\u5668\u7ec4\u88c5\u7684PCB\uff1a\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u539f\u7406\u56fe\u548c\u7535\u8def\u677f(#656)\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SVG\u5bfc\u51fa\u3002\u8fd9\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u77e2\u91cf\u56fe\u5f62\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u4e3a\u5404\u79cd\u76ee\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\n\u00b1propos\u6587\u4ef6\u5bfc\u51fa\uff1aBOM CSV\u5bfc\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u7528\u9017\u53f7\u5206\u9694\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5206\u53f7\u5206\u9694(#678)\u3002\u8fd9\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0eCSV\u8bfb\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\nLibrePCB 0.1.4\u5bf9\u9879\u76ee\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6240\u6709\u4e4b\u524d\u76840.1.x\u7248\u672c\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b8c\u5168\u517c\u5bb9\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u7248\u672c\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728NetNames\u4e2d\u6709\u6362\u884c\u7b26(#603)\u3002\u8fd9\u57280.1.4\u4e2d\u5df2\u7ecf\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u9884\u671f(\u6216\u5e0c\u671b\u2026)\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u9879\u76ee\u53d7\u5230\u6b64\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5347\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u4ecd\u7136\u9047\u5230\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528LibrePCB 0.1.4\u6253\u5f00\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5219\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u540d\u79f0\u3002\u8bf7\u4e0d\u8981\u72b9\u8c6b\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002\n2020-05-03", "note_en": "This minor release is one more important step to make LibrePCB more powerfuland to improve usability of the user interface.\n   The user interface got many usability improvements to make creating librariesand projects more efficient. For example the schematic- and board editors nowallow searching for symbols resp. devices( #671):\n  Furthermore, all input fields for length values (line width, drill diameter,coordinate etc.) are now displayed in the unit configured in the workspacesettings ( #684). The unit ofeach input field can even be changed individually and gets saved and restoredautomatically. And you can now enter mathematical expressions and optionallyappend a unit (e.g. \u201cmm\u201d) which will then be evaluated:\n   This release adds a pick&amp;place CSV file export( #639) so LibrePCB is nowalso suitable to design PCBs which will be assembled by pick&amp;place machines:\n  In addition, an SVG export has been implemented for both, schematics andboards ( #656). This allows topostprocess them in a vector graphics tool for various purposes.\n \u00c0 propos file export: The BOM CSV export is now comma-separated instead ofsemicolon-separated ( #678).This improves compatibility with CSV readers.\n  LibrePCB 0.1.4 uses exactly the same file format for projects as all previous0.1.x releases and are thus fully compatible.\n However, previous versions had a bug which allowed to have linebreaks in netnames ( #603). This has beenfixed in 0.1.4, and since we expect (or hope\u2026) no projects to be affected bythis bug, no automatic upgrade mechanism has been implemented. If you stillrun into the issue that a project cannot be opened with LibrePCB 0.1.4, theaffected net names need to be fixed manually. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us to get help with the migration.\n                     2020-05-03", "posttime": "2020-05-04 02:16:14", "tags": "\u53d1\u5e03,librepcb,\u73b0\u5728,csv", "title": "LibrePCB 0.1.4\u53d1\u5e03", "title_en": "LibrePCB 0.1.4 Released", "transed": 1, "url": "https://librepcb.org/blog/2020-05-03_release_0.1.4/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u53d1\u5e03", "librepcb", "\u73b0\u5728", "csv"]}]
