"note_en": "A close friend of mine, Dennis, is one of the editors and contributors to Headache Comix, an underground magazine for comics, so far only available in print. He asked me to do a website for Headache Comix , and I said yes - why not? Visit  headachecomix.com to see the result.\n Headache Comix had quite strong opinions on what they wanted. Luckily for me, neither a designer nor a UX-er, they wanted what I call an anti-aesthetics.\n Sure, the wording anti-aesthetics is an oxymoron, just like &#39;when bad UX is good&#39;. But the fascinating thing with words is their ability to communicate beyond propositions about a external reality.\n What I mean with an anti-aesthetics, is that they wanted the design to look good but not too good. They wanted a specific sentiment for the site and this sentiment excluded &#39;professionality&#39;.\n  The marketplace is currently empty but will be filled with &#39;stuff&#39;, things they want to sell, uncategorized items. And why? Partly because they don&#39;t have &#39;merchandise&#39;. But also because this kind of randomness, in lack of a better word, captures the spirit of the magazine.\n Headache Comix wanted an experience that has nothing to do with what we as developers normally would deal with when producing an application.\n  Headache Comix wanted no, at least not in this stage, integrations to the Paypal API or something like that, no shopping cart, not even a form for subscriptions nor a search functionality, or any other feature of a professional site.\n My friend Dennis met Nic when he lived in Cambodia and did odd jobs as a designer. One reason Nic stays in Cambodia is that it is cheap. He can afford to live from his different projects by living there. Although some famous underground artists contribute they will never get rich in doing this.\n Dennis and Nic were happy with the result as they think I captured the essence of the project. And as I understand their reaction, their target group enjoys it as well.\n The Website did not take long to create. All there is, is an HTML and CSS template I fill with Markdown. All routes besides the root are based on the file names of the Markdown files. I use Showdown.js to parse the Markdown and a few lines of node.js, using express, to produce the backend.\n The only frontend JavaScript is a few lines to change the class of menu items based on the path (of the URL), making a route active. If it is active the background is colored yellow.\n  It was not a stimulating project in terms of programming, I did not have to think about how to solve things. But it still triggered me.\n  I think one of the most amazing aspects of the Web is how it houses sites such as Headache Comix next to professional sites with advanced features.\n  When people speak about the Web of old as the Wild West, I say it is still there. The Web still has this. It&#39;s just harder to find.\n  Not because of my &#39;splendid&#39; anti-aesthetic design (a good designer and/or a UX-er would have done soo much better than me) - because of the amazing comics, the fantastic covers of the magazine available in the archive. Because they do this because they love doing art and love sharing what they do. And because you can tell this is true. At least to me, this is inspiring.\n The Web is still the Wild West if we leave the large towns, and sometimes we should.\n I believe the contrast makes both the cities and rural areas of the Web more interesting.\n The only difference between the Web of old and the modern Web is that the wild Web sometimes is harder do find due to the instrumentality of the Google search engine, for good and bad.\n  I have only lived here for a few years, but under those few years, more and more shops disappear from the city and are now situated in a large shopping mall outside of town.\n I hate going there, malls don&#39;t have any soul and every store looks the same. Also, I feel trapped when visiting. I get anxiety from walking there and I never remember how to find store X if I need to buy something.\n Personally, I miss the randomness of small shops. I&#39;ve never visited a shop at a mall that&#39;s close to being personal. And if this feeling misses out, the things sold won&#39;t be experienced as authentic.\n Most of the time, this is fine. We don&#39;t care about this since we go there to buy things for consumption, things we will not have in a few years. Things we don&#39;t care about. And we&#39;re all good consumers, we&#39;re all hypocrites. But we can try not to be.\n The good thing with the non-physical spatiality of the Web is how little it costs to buy a domain and host some files. How easy it is to have a Website selling things. This admits sites like Headache Comix where you&#39;d have to mail some random person to have a subscription. I can&#39;t even remember if it is apparent that you can\u2026 ;)\n I love browsing books on Amazon. They have like all books I want to read, and you can often preview them. This feature requires a professional website and it is a very nice feature. But I also like more amateur-ish sites such as Headache Comix.\n  The Web would not be the same without sites like Amazon and Headache Comix. The Web should be equally professional and amateur-ish.\n  Sometimes the feelings we have - the associations and sentiments born - when meeting bad UX in the meaning limited &#39;usability&#39; have more benefits than downsides, since UX is a wider field than usability. Sometimes we want things to be amateur-ish because professionalism would destroy them. Other times we want professionalism and all the advanced features of a site such as Amazon.\n  Art is useless because its aim is simply to create a mood. It is not meant to instruct, or to influence action in any way. [ \u2026] A work of art is useless as a flower is useless. A flower blossoms for its own joy. We gain a moment of joy by looking at it. That is all that is to be said about our relations to flowers. Of course man may sell the flower, and so make it useful to him, but this has nothing to do with the flower. It is not part of its essence. It is accidental.  ...\n In this, I agree with Wilde. And I think these words capture something essential about this specific element of UX.\n When the Web stops being a bazaar, we know the Web do be dead. But I am not very worried. The Web is built to house both megacities and small taverns.

It is a learning environment where children explore mathematical ideas and create projects of their own design. Logo, the first programming language explicitly designed for children, was invented by Seymour Papert, Wallace Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow, and Cynthia Solomon in 1966 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN).Logo\u2019s design drew upon two theoretical frameworks: Jean Piaget\u2019s constructivism and Marvin Minsky\u2019s artificial intelligence research at MIT. One of Logo\u2019s foundational ideas was that children should have a powerful programming environment. Early Lisp served as a model with its symbolic computation, recursive functions, operations on linked lists, and dynamic scoping of variables.Logo became a symbol for change in elementary mathematics education and in the nature of school itself. The search for harnessing the computer\u2019s potential to provide new ways of teaching and learning became a central focus and guiding principle in Logo language development. It encompassed a widening scope that included natural language, music, graphics, animation, story telling, turtle geometry, robots, and other physical devices.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 00:13:39",

"note_en": "Lately, a bunch of early stage founders have emailed me to ask for go-to-market (GTM) advice. They have a real product, it solves a real problem for their handful of customers\u2026\n  It\u2019s a problem faced by nearly every single technical founder I talk to.\n The unfortunate truth is that the first year of sales will tend to make or break the company. Sales provides the initial momentum for a startup to survive. It\u2019s the difference between a Series A, and an  Our Incredible Journey Medium post.\n The trouble is\u2026 I\u2019ve always felt at a bit of a loss when asked for sales advice.\n I\u2019ve worked way more on the product and tech side. Until recently, I\u2019d never had a strong framework for understanding how sales actually works.\n That changed after I recently attended a two-day sales training. Our CRO hired a consulting firm called  Force Management ( I know, I know, it sounds like soul-crushing corporate training, but bear with me) to teach all of our GTM teams about sales. I was fortunate enough to sit in.\n Candidly, I was impressed by everything the instructors taught us. They were handing me the exact answers to the questions these founders were asking me for.\n My goal in this post is to relay all of those learnings as concrete advice for early stage founders. By reading it, you should be armed with the framework you need to sell a SaaS product to other businesses (and have a view into the enterprise).\n We\u2019ve gotten Segment surprisingly far without having any of this sort of framework. But frankly, I wish we\u2019d known this much earlier on. There\u2019s no reason not to be great at this from day one.\n Without further ado; here\u2019s everything I\u2019ve learned when it comes to selling a B2B product.\n   Before getting into tactics, I want to spend a minute on the importance of sales, particularly in the enterprise.\n I used to think that \u201cproducts just sell themselves\u201d. A great product naturally spreads like wildfire.\n I\u2019ve since realized that I was dead wrong. A great product may be the backbone of a company, but it\u2019s not sufficient all on it\u2019s own. Here\u2019s why.\n Think about all of the products you buy today\u2026 food, gas, coffee. For the most part, these products are  commodities. The cost of the good is dictated by the raw ingredients and the competition; maybe there\u2019s some markup for additional quality.\n What that means is that you might encounter a $5 cup of coffee on your morning commute\u2026 but a $50 cup of coffee would be unheard of.\n Now in the enterprise, these rules go out the window . For most SaaS business, the cost to deliver your product rounds down to zero[1]. The infrastructure used to run our Salesforce instance probably costs somewhere on the order of $100 per month. Yet, they charge us tens of thousands of dollars per month\u2026 how?\n In enterprise software, customers pay for software based upon the  value that software provides, not the cost to deliver or build that software.\n The same product can be sold for $50, or $5,000,000\u2013and the price comes down to  how much value the buyer is getting from the software. As long as the buyer sees it as a positive return on investment, it\u2019s worth it to pay the price.\n A great salesperson steers the conversation towards that value. If you\u2019re not anchoring against the value, you are literally leaving money on the table.\n      When I think of salespeople\u2026 I typically think of people  without my best interests at heart. They\u2019re trying to close the deal. They don\u2019t really know or care about the things I want.\n Honestly, this rule applies to 99% of sales interactions I\u2019ve had. Why shouldn\u2019t this stereotype hold if I\u2019m talking to someone trying to sell me something?\n  When selling, you have to approach the discussion from a totally different mindset all together. Great sales isn\u2019t about closing the deal\u2026 it starts with understanding the customer.\n Don\u2019t think of yourself as constantly trying to pitch them on your company. Instead, think of yourself as a consultant or a trusted advisor. You\u2019re trying to help the customer get the outcome they want  (and maybe that\u2019s not buying your product!).\n Getting there requires two key skills: 1) actually listening to the business needs and 2) demonstrating that you\u2019re listening.\n  Do your homework: read 10-Qs, earnings reports, and press briefings. Try out the product or service, and see what customers are saying. Look at reviews on G2Crowd, Capiche, and Yelp. Have an idea of what matters to your customer before that first call. Companies (especially public ones) put out a ton of information on what they want to get done. It\u2019s on you to find it.\n Ask \u201cwhat does success look like?\u201d: anyone considering buying a tool will have an idea of what they want to get out of it. There\u2019s likely some quarterly goal that they want to achieve, or some metric that they want to impact. It\u2019s a great idea to understand what matters most to the customer.\n Tie back to a business objective: at the end of the day, businesses traditionally value just a handful of things: increased revenue, decreased cost, reduced risk, or time to outcome. It\u2019s worth understanding what the overall goals for the business are here, because your product should support one of those top-level goals. Saying \u201cwe have a better UI\u201d doesn\u2019t really paint the ROI story that you need.\n Write it all down: there&#39;s one big commonality between our best salespeople: they are  constantly taking notes in a notebook. No one will object to you taking notes\u2014and it\u2019s a key way to remember exactly what the customer said. You\u2019ll want to use these notes in follow-up emails and conversations. It\u2019s really easy to do and makes you seem like a pro.\n At the end of the day, selling well means that you are helping the customer actually understand their problem, and the path to evaluate a solution. Don\u2019t sell, consult!\n   Okay, once you\u2019ve started learning about what the customer cares about, you need to get a first meeting with them.\n   Getting customers coming to you means that you first have to put something interesting out there.\n When it comes to content, my #1 rule for this is  teach people something they didn\u2019t already know. It has to be non-obvious, and combine some set of deep research or your own data.\n A good rule of thumb is asking yourself \u201cdo I wish I\u2019d read this post six months ago?\u201d It\u2019s easy to become \u201ctoo familiar\u201d with content that\u2019s actually really interesting.\n Priceonomics has the definitive guide on building out interesting content, so if you want to go this route, check them out first:  The Content Marketing Handbook.\n I\u2019ll warn you right now that inbound is going to be a slower path. But it\u2019s far more likely to succeed for some audiences (developers in particular).\n  Putting up blog posts \u2014 we shared posts about anything,  what we\u2019d learned and  what we\u2019d built internally.\n Open sourcing internal tools \u2014 we  open sourced a  lot of useful  utilities. For each one, we\u2019d design a logo and put up a landing page.\n Launching Analytics Academy \u2014 we realized people were eager to learn more about analytics,  and the best way to highlight Segment was to teach them.\n  If you need a faster path to getting users (or your market requires it), you may have to rely more on cold emails.\n As a rule, most people  hate getting outbound emails. I certainly do ( we actually used to have a rule at Segment that we didn\u2019t send outbound emails ever).\n Most outbound emails I get aren\u2019t personalized. Best case, they feel like spam, worst case, they are downright annoying. I archive almost all of them immediately.\n I\u2019ve since come around a bit, mainly because I\u2019ve realized:  outbound emails don&#39;t have to suck. A few ground rules:\n Do your homework: sound familiar? Make sure that you\u2019ve researched the person you\u2019re emailing. Look at LinkedIn, Twitter, recent talks they\u2019ve given. Make sure you can put yourself in their shoes.\n 20 emails are better than 1,000: I\u2019ve found time-and-time-again that a handful of emails are better than a random blast. If you need early user feedback, focus on those few users you really want.\n Answer: Why me? Why now? If I&#39;m going to get an email from you, you have to make it clear that you\u2019ve done your homework. You have to mention something that\u2019s both relevant to me, and explain why you\u2019re emailing now.  e.g. I saw your talk on handling outages, and it got me thinking about entrypoints. I realized that there should be some sort of tool to make those more apparent. We \u2019ve built a first version that I \u2019d love to show you. It incorporates your  ...\n Get an intro so many of the founders I talk to don\u2019t lean on their investors hard enough for intros. Yet, it makes me 10x more likely to talk to a new startup if someone else recommends them.\n   Now, let\u2019s shift gears to what happens when you\u2019re actually talking to the prospect.\n The truth of the matter is that 99% of salespeople start with the same exact pitch. It\u2019s pre-canned, it\u2019s not personal, and it\u2019s irrelevant. In other words\u2026 it\u2019s far less likely to succeed. It\u2019s the dead opposite of what we want to do.\n  Before ever talking about \u201cwhat it is you do\u201d, you need to gain a clear understanding of the problems the  customer is trying to solve. And you need to have a crystal clear idea of how they are doing things today.\n That means asking open-ended, illustrative questions. As an example, I\u2019ll share a few that are particularly relevant for Segment:\n  These questions help establish the \u201cbefore\u201d state; it\u2019s the status quo.\n The before state probably has some rough edges\u2026 maybe it\u2019s expensive or a waste of time. Go deep here, you need to figure out where the real pain for the customer comes from. You need to be able to articulate that pain later, so ask questions even they may seem obvious.\n Once you understand the status quo\u2026 start probing for what the business should look like in a year.\n This is where the \u201cafter\u201d state comes into the picture. If the customer could have their dreams fulfilled, what set of things would they want to exist?\n Write down that \u201cafter\u201d state diligently. Ideally the after state should have a set of \u201caxioms that are now true\u201d as well as concrete business outcomes and metrics.\n   Once you and the customer both have a clear picture of the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d states, then there\u2019s the natural question of \u201chow do we get there?\u201d\n That\u2019s where we get into creating  required capabilities. These are the list of requirements that need to be true to transform from the before state to the after state.\n  Crafting the required capabilities should be a collaborative affair. If you\u2019re just listing out a set of requirements, you\u2019re doing it wrong. You\u2019ve stopped listening.\n Imagine it in the same way that you&#39;d build your product. You don\u2019t just go into a room solo and emerge with a list of strict requirements. You\u2019ll whiteboard them, pressure-test them, and give and get feedback from the customer.\n It\u2019s your goal to understand what their list of requirements is. At the end of the day, you want to agree on that list.\n To see what this looks like, suppose I\u2019m trying to sell Datadog, an application monitoring tool.\n    Remember, the customer is the expert on their organization, and the needs it has. You are likely the expert on how companies evaluate and buy your software. The two of you need to strategize together to figure out what makes sense.\n   Finally, it\u2019s the moment you\u2019ve been waiting for! The time to tell the customer about all of the great things you\u2019ve built.\n The way  not to do this is to put together a laundry list of features you\u2019ve built. Instead, you want to speak to the value you provide\u2014and that means bucketing the problems your product solves into several different buckets.\n There are only a handful of types of value propositions when it comes to selling to businesses:\n  At all costs, you should be able to map some part of your product and its features to these four outcomes.\n When I think about the products that we pay for an use at Segment, all of them fall into these different buckets:\n  Of course, some of these value propositions are correlated (speed often decreases cost), but the key is that they can contribute meaningfully to the business model in some manner.\n    If you remember nothing else from this post, just memorize this section. The mantra is a handy tool to use to wrap up conversations, re-affirm what you just talked about, and discuss next steps.\n The mantra should be \u201chappy birthday\u201d level memorized, so that you can repeat it by heart at a moment\u2019s notice.\n  These six lines help establish mutual understanding. It shows that you\u2019ve actually listened to the customer and their problems, and affirms that your product can really help them.\n     Plain and simple, a sales criteria ensures that you\u2019ve covered your bases. It\u2019s a rigorous tool you can use to evaluate a deal and see where you might have blind spots.\n Think of criteria in the same way that you\u2019d think of the checklists that NASA or SpaceX use to launch rockets. If any field isn\u2019t checked\u2026 you might be missing a key piece of the picture.\n   Metrics are one of the most important parts of a sale. You and the buyer should both be agreed on which metrics the product will impact for the business. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll measure the success of the product (and ideally the ROI).\n  The economic buyer is the person who actually buys a product\u2014the catch is that they may or may not be the person who wants to use it. In every case, you want to know who can actually make the purchasing decisions.\n  The decision criteria are more or less the \u201crequired capabilities\u201d I talked about earlier on in the post. They determine how the customer will evaluate the product you\u2019re selling.\n In every case, a viable option for the customer will be to \u201cdo nothing\u201d. They don\u2019t have to buy your product, or any product for that matter.\n The best way to prove the case for your product is with your metrics. Doing nothing should be a very expensive option.\n  Of course, the criteria are only a piece of the puzzle. The decision process governs how customers will actually purchase a piece of software.\n This can vary wildly from company to company\u2014so you should take care to understand how your customer actually buys software. Ask questions to confirm:\n   The paper process refers to all the forms, paperwork, and contracts as part of a deal. While it sounds similar to the decision process, DO NOT IGNORE THIS STEP. We\u2019ve had a number of deals fail to close over the years just because we weren\u2019t sure of how the paperwork actually got signed.\n  Though it\u2019s far down in the acronym, the identified pain is really where you should start with the customer. You should be able to answer in great detail why their life is currently painful, and how they handle the problems you solve today.\n  Your champion is the customer who is rooting for you and wants to buy your product. In the early stage, it\u2019s likely that your champion and buyer are the same person. But as you grow and expand your deal size, the champion might need to get permission to buy your product.\n When this happens, you need to be giving your champion firepower! Help them provide collateral to the rest of their organization to teach them why your product is the best!\n  Lastly, you should know your competition. It could be internal efforts, it could be competitors, or it could be doing nothing at all. In each case, make sure you know why the customer is considering your competition.\n   In some sense, sales is just another form of finding product market fit. Instead of helping a customer use a product, you are helping them make a decision.\n If you take nothing else from this post, remember that your customer is the expert on the problems they want solved. They have an extremely detailed view of what matters to their business, likely crafted over years. It\u2019s your job to help them understand how those problems map to the different products on the market, and how to make the decision to buy your product in particular.\n As a final parting thought, I think most of the lessons here aren\u2019t just applicable for startup founders. They\u2019re useful for anyone who wants to sell an idea within their company, or establish a culture of elite sales from day one.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 00:13:35", "tags":

"note_en": "This week marks my one-year anniversary of quitting my full-time job and becoming an independent NLP/ML engineer and researcher (which I just call \u201cfreelance AI engineer\u201d below). My experience so far has been very positive, and the past year was probably one of the most productive years in my entire career. My \u201cachievements\u201d in the past year include:\n Writing and publishing  Real-World NLP, my NLP introduction book that I\u2019ve been working on the past 1.5 years\n Doing research and launching many open-source NLP projects, including  TEASPN,  NanigoNet,  Github Typo Corpus, and most recently,  Open Language Profiles\n Developing  an ultra-fine-grained NER system, which ranked at #2 at TAC-KBP 2019, using transfer and multitask learning\n Working on  an introductory course to teach AllenNLP, which will be launched within a couple of months\n Now, I believe that becoming a freelance AI engineer is a totally viable career choice (but only for those who are cut out for it\u2014see below). A number of friends and people that I know asked what it\u2019s like to be a freelancer. Many of them haven\u2019t even heard of any \u201cfreelance researchers\u201d before (yeah, me neither). That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing down my thoughts and experience here so that this might be useful if you are even vaguely interested.\n  The answer is probably \u201cno\u201d for the vast majority of people. Being a freelancer is not for everyone. You need to be a type of person who enjoys being a freelancer. More on this later.\n You also have to be really good at what you do. Put yourself in the client\u2019s shoes and think of this as hiring a contractor, be it a plumber or an attorney. You hire them because, by paying them, you expect that they can almost certainly solve your problem, not because you want them to be \u201cpart of your team\u201d and work on the problem together, offering them opportunities for learning and growing, along with plenty of PTO days and free lunch.\n As a freelance AI engineer, you are expected to, for example, start with a client, familiarize yourself with the product and the codebase, submit the first PR within a couple of days, and complete your first business-metric impacting ML prototype or pipeline within the first couple of weeks. If you are just starting out in the AI field, I think your best bet is to go work at a large company (e.g., FAANG) with plenty of resources and growing opportunities, or at a fast-growing start-up (if  ...\n  I charge hourly. I\u2019ve never done project-based billing. I think AI projects are better suited for hourly billing, because it\u2019s simply too hard to define the scope of work based on the deliverables.\n My current rate is $200/hour for short-term commitments (e.g., a couple hours per month) and $150/hour longer-term commitments (e.g., 10+ hours per week). There \u2019s only one time when I was told my rate is too expensive, but most clients just take these rates as fixed. When clients can \u2019t afford my rates, we usually negotiate in terms of the scope of work (e.g., hours per week) instead of the rate. The rates of an average US-based AI engineer with my skills are probably higher. I probably  ...\n Thanks to the \u201cAI boom \u201dof recent years, it&#39;s completely a seller&#39;s market for freelance AI engineers (again, if you are good). You will never run out of client leads and inbound requests. I think a good rule of thumb is to keep increasing your rates until you start getting \u201cno \u201ds with a 50% chance. You are still left with the other 50%, which tend to be better clients anyways. As a side effect, you \u2019ll get very good at saying no. My default answer is always no, and my schedule  ...\n   We have enough savings to keep us from being hungry for a couple of years even if I didn\u2019t work at all, and my wife works full time, which was really helpful when I made the leap. Even with enough savings, though, cash flow fluctuation can have a noticeable impact on your sense of financial security. If you work with  net 30clients, for example, it takes two months to get paid after you start working for them. I had some short periods of time when we had negative cash flow (especially when  ...\n Compared to when I was working full-time, I made less money but also worked fewer hours in the past year. I could totally have worked more to make more, but having small kids, spending time with my family is important.\n   I found most of my current and past clients through my network. Conferences and workshops are also good sources of potential leads, especially when you give talks instead of just listening to them. When I find a potential client that I really want to work with, I apply directly from the \u201ccareers\u201d page. A surprisingly large number of employees, especially start-ups, are open to remote and/or part-time commitments for the right candidates if you are upfront about it.\n As a freelancer, you are always on the lookout for potential clients, since most contracts don\u2019t last more than several months. This is a big difference between being a full-time employee and a freelancer. At least when I was working full time, my \u201cjob search\u201d was very bimodal\u2014I was either not looking at all or looking actively. If you just want a stable job and a paycheck, freelancing is probably not a good idea.\n   People say the biggest perk of being a freelancer is freedom \u2014you can work anywhere you like, anytime you want. This is probably not the most important factor, at least for me. Especially in the tech industry, many employers are already fine with employees working from anywhere and at anytime as long as they get things done. Even before becoming a freelancer I was able to work from home whenever necessary (for example, my kid getting sick), and in 2018, I even spent a month in South  ...\n Being a freelancer, you have full control over how much you work. On the other hand, working full time, especially for a start-up, is very \u201cbinary\u201d\u2014basically you go all in or you are out. You are expected to work at your full potential. You can\u2019t usually, say, work 20 hours per week to collect half the paycheck. Freelancers can do this fairly easily, which is one of the biggest perks of being independent.\n I \u2019m also a type of person who always has tons of project ideas that I want to work on which may or may not be relevant to what I do for the employer that I happen to work for at that time. I \u2019ve always considered myself more of an artist than an engineer/researcher, and being a freelancer is a natural consequence of this. If you work full time for a demanding job, good luck working on a side hustle or even finding energy for one at all. As a freelancer, everything becomes a side  ...\n  As a freelancer, you need to be good at managing your time, which equals your clients\u2019 money. I\u2019m a huge fan of  the Pomodoro technique and manage all my work with pomodoros (oops, I meant  pomodori). I can reliably do about 80 pomodori (= 40 hours) in a typical work week. If you \u2019ve ever used the Pomodoro technique, you \u2019d probably know how hard that would be and how much work that is. If you haven \u2019t, you should seriously consider giving it a try \u2014you \u2019d realize how hard it is to  ...\n Not all of these 40 hours are billable, though. These include personal and work-related overhead such as learning (see below), sending invoices, managing your budget, etc. Also, if you work on research, you need to take into account the time you spend for academic activities. If you take on paper reviews for a conference, count that in. If you are an organizer of a workshop, count that in as well. This helps you be realistic about your \u201cquota \u201dyou can use for each one of your activities.  ...\n Many of my clients don \u2019t require regular \u201ccheck-ins, \u201dand currently I spend only 2 \u20133 hours in meetings in a typical week. Meetings have huge spillover effects and really take their toll on me. For example, if I even have a single meeting in the afternoon, I tend to start vaguely thinking what I \u2019d talk about, if there \u2019s any preparation necessary (including booking a room), etc. After the meeting, I would recall what we talked about and any necessary follow-ups. All these spillover  ...\n   So far, this article has had very little to do with the \u201cAI\u201d part. What do I actually  do? In the past year, I wore many different hats\u2014consultant, engineer, and researcher. For some clients, I have meetings and offer advice on how they should go about implementing AI projects. For others, I write code as a contract software engineer. For yet others, I work on research and co-author papers. For many, however, it\u2019s a mix of all of these.\n I think modern machine learning work is suitable for part-time commitments. If you are working on large models, it is not uncommon that training takes hours, if not days. Machine learning researchers and practitioners alike know how much time they spend training models and tuning hyperparameters. If you work full time, you have no option but to wait until the training is done or switch to other projects, if you have any. As a freelancer, you just switch between clients.\n As an ML freelancer, you need to have a strategy for securing GPU resources for training models. Some clients are kind enough that they just let me use their own infrastructure, but others may not (usually contractors \u2019access is very limited for security reasons). For my personal and small client projects, I just spawn AWS spot instances (usually a p3.2xlarge) as needed, using my own custom AMI. I also have a smaller GPU instance on GCP that I start and stop as needed. I don  ...\n If you work in AI, it is critical that you allocate time for learning and personal development. If you are working full time, it\u2019s usually part of your day job, and you usually spend time reading papers and having \u201creading groups\u201d during work hours. As a freelancer, these hours are usually not billable. You can\u2019t usually bill a client for three hours just because you spent this much time reading papers last week (if you know such a client, or if you  aresuch a client, do let  ...\n I live in Seattle, but I\u2019m not sure if it helps with being a freelancer at all. I work remotely and rarely travel for work, except when I present at conferences. I work with  Allen AI, and it \u2019s nice that I can simply drop by on short notice and have lunch with the team, although I would be able to do my work even if I was on the other side of the earth. If you work remotely, I think you \u2019d be better off if you lived in a cheaper city and work with clients in other large tech  ...\n   There are definitely ways to develop your career and become more experienced as a freelancer, but these look very different from full-time jobs. I\u2019m just starting out, so I might have different opinions next year.\n There are usually no pay raises baked into the contracts, unless you negotiate. But you can gradually raise your rates (say, twice a year) until people start to say no. For this reason, I think it is probably easier to make more as a freelancer than as a full-time employee who needs to rely on performance reviews and promotions that are often out of your control.\n Speaking of promotions\u2014as a freelancer, you can stay immune to office politics. You either get the job done or you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t need to be constantly thinking which boss you should be brown-nosing in order to get your next promotion. The flip side of this is you usually don\u2019t gain management experience as a freelancer, although I do mentor junior devs and researchers who work for my clients.\n I think it helps to think of yourself as a specialist, not a generalist. For example, if you have a serious health issue that requires a very complicated surgery, you probably don \u2019t want your family doctor to work on it. If you have a complicated lawsuit that involves millions of dollars at stake, you probably don \u2019t ask your personal tax accountant to give you advice. It \u2019d be your best interest if you don \u2019t just \u201cdo AI. \u201dIf you are an AI generalist who just does \u201c ...\n My expertise is NLP/ML for Asian language processing and language education. When defining your specialty, I think it helps if you define it in terms of the industry, not in terms of an ML stack. People look for, e.g., \u201cAI solutions for healthcare \u201dand \u201ctext analytics for finance, \u201dnot for \u201cGANs \u201dor \u201cSeq2Seq models. \u201dYou need to be willing to learn a very wide range of ML techniques and models, from simple regression to GANs and RL, no matter what industry you work in.  ...\n If you are even vaguely interested in starting your own business, especially a B-to-B SaaS business, I think working as a freelancer for a year or so is a great way to learn about the market demands and transition into the entrepreneurial endeavor. If you work with multiple clients and projects in your field, you will surely notice some common patterns and needs. These are great seeds of product ideas. Some of my open-source projects (e.g.,  NanigoNet and  Open Language  ...\n   I incorporated a single-member LLC just for freelancing (and filed a foreign entity after I moved to Washington). I sign all the contracts as an owner of my LLC. Some of my non-US clients prefer it if I have \u201ca company. \u201dI \u2019m not a lawyer so you need to take everything written here with a huge grain of salt, but I don \u2019t think there \u2019s any huge difference between being a sole proprietor and being a single-member LLC, unless you screw something up (e.g., being sued  ...\n I think the US is a great place to be a freelancer, even for an immigrant non-native English speaker like me. Being a legal permanent resident makes it easier to work with US-based clients, who usually pay better. The legal system is at least decent. Filing an LLC is just a matter of going to the state secretary \u2019s website and filling out a form, if you know what you are doing. On the contrary, even thinking about incorporating in Japan, for example, makes me shudder,  ...\n A downside of being a US-based freelancer is medical insurance. I continued my previous employer\u2019s health plan using COBRA and switched over to a plan that I bought on the state marketplace when I moved. Be prepared to pay at least a couple hundred dollars more per month on premiums than you\u2019d pay as a full-time employee.\n Read  Working for Yourself\u2014Law &amp; Taxes for Independent Contractors, Freelancers &amp; Gig Workers of All Types from Nolo before you start. I read this book literally cover to cover before I got started, which was worth every single penny. Check out  some of their  related books, too. They are also good.\n I can\u2019t say much about taxes, because this April will be the first tax filing season since I became independent. I discussed my options thoroughly with my CPA before I took the jump. I keep track of my business income and expenses on a Google Spreadsheet. I\u2019m not sure if this is a good idea. At the least, don\u2019t forget to pay quarterly estimated taxes.\n  In this post, I showed that a freelance AI engineer can be a viable career path. You need to understand that this is a very qualified statement and your mileage may vary. Don\u2019t get mad at me even if you go independent and go broke. If you are interested in knowing more, have any questions or feedback,  shoot me an email.

"note_en": "This report is going to show you the techniques used by short sellers and underwriters to manipulate the price of public companies ahead of stock offerings. You will also learn of an industry trick known as \u201cGun and Run\u201d. As of yet, this is the only report of its kind.\n      Over the lifespan of this Trump bull run, there have been few that have moved with such a vigorous frenzy as HMNY back in 2017.\u00a0 For awhile, you could say that it grabbed the heart of the nation, and every wannabe investor was just dying to get a piece of the action. The former  executive of Netflix was involved!\u00a0 Moviepass!\u00a0 Brilliant!\u00a0 It was going to revolutionize the theater industry just like Netflix did to television!\u00a0  As many of us know, hope and fear can be a dangerous mix; something  ...\n            Maybe it is hard to blame people for being mesmerized by this chart. The buying was so strong, and for those that don\u2019t know, or are too busy with their daily lives to follow the complexities of the stock market \u2014 let alone read the complicated language in SEC filings \u2014 this price action would look like magic.\n      Then a guy like this comes along. Nice suit, good looking, smiles, uses bullet points in his report \u2014 he must really know what he is talking about!\n            Now you can\u2019t be swayed! Even if the price were to go to zero, there would still be a small shadow of hope deep within the cavern of your soul.\u00a0 \u00a0You would still believe, part of you would still be grasping, yearning like it was some long lost love that was suddenly taken from you without warning!\n          So what happened!?\u00a0 The share price went from a high of $38 to being a penny stock in less then a year!\n    It all started on November. 6th of 2017 when they received $100 000 000 from the sale of convertible notes. For anybody who doesn\u2019t know what those are, that\u2019s okay, they are very simple to understand.\u00a0 Most of the time when a lender loans a company money, the only way the borrower can pay them back is with cash or assets, but with a convertible note they have the option of being paid back with shares in the company rather than just with money.  At first, the agreement  ...\n          HMNY was projected by many analysts to be a  loss making operation, and it didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure this out.\u00a0 In essence, their business model was to \u00a0sell 30 movie passes for the price of one, and all the subscriber had to do was pay $9.99 per month and they could go to the movies once per day for the entire year.\u00a0 \u00a0  To most unsuspecting victims of this scam, it seemed like a great concept \u2014at first. The theater industry was struggling due  ...\n  Basically when you break it all down, the  cornerstone of their business model was the assumption that nobody would use their subscriptions.\u00a0 Genius huh?\u00a0 Just give people the right to do something, then hope that they are too stupid and lazy to actually do it!\u00a0\u00a0  Here is how that brilliant idea panned out.\n        For a company doing so poorly, the CEO\u2019s seemed to be having a blast in this picture.\n            There\u2019s something about the look on the guys face on the right though.\u00a0 Something that just kinda\u2026.rubs you the wrong way..You seeing what I\u2019m seeing?\n  The investors sure weren\u2019t happy.\u00a0  One lucky fella at least got something out of it though.\u00a0 He was given the great privilege of loaning out his shares by Charles Schwab, but it wasn\u2019t like Schwab was doing the guy a favor or anything. They just turned around and lent the shares to someone else at a 100% mark up.\n  You see, all that money that was rolling out of the pockets of average people wasn\u2019t just disappearing into some black hole, it was rolling into the pockets of people like that creep pictured on the right.\n  Oh yeah, remember when I said the devil is in the details? Those notes didn \u2019t actually end up getting sold for $12 as per the initial agreement. It turned out that any future equity offerings would immediately reprice the shares that were owed to the lender so they equaled the price of the shares issued in all future equity offerings. If HMNY sold new shares at a price of, let \u2019s say 50 cents, all new shares used to pay the lenders would  ...\n        No there is nothing wrong with your vision, and yes, they issued billions of new shares\n          So who did profit from this massive pump and dump?\u00a0 Someone must have, right?\u00a0 Well, there was a few in particular, and to your surprise, the real profiteers were not the CEO\u2019s.\u00a0 Sure they got theirs, don\u2019t get me wrong, but there was others that stood to gain much more from this scam \u2013100\u2019s of millions more.\n  You might also be wondering who in the hell bought all those shares?\u00a0 You saw those financials; in hindsight it would seem like you would have to be either insane, or extremely stupid to do such a thing.\u00a0 Who would buy into a company that is burning through that much cash on a quarterly basis?\u00a0   Short Sellers.\u00a0 \u00a0  Over the lifespan of this brazen scam that deprived so many innocent hard working people of their  life savings, there  ...\n              When most people think of a pump and dump, they envision people buying stock before the price increases, then selling to unsuspecting investors after the pump has occurred, but you might be surprised to find out that this can also work the other way around.\n  Short sellers and investment bankers can artificially inflate the share price, sell the stock to all the suckers at inflated prices, then once the market capitalization crashes back to where it belongs, they can buy them back for pennies on the dollar. As you can see in the above chart, the share price spikes more than 50% only to suddenly reverse the very next day after news of an offering was released in the afterhours  ...\n                                        You can see they report owning 1,425 000 shares on December.13th, and if you look at the volume on that chart, the date seems to line up perfectly. What most people fail to recognize is that this institutional investor was almost certainly short prior to this sudden overnight collapse, and that this \u201cpurchase \u201dwas actually short covering so they could deliver the shares they borrowed back to the lender.  ...\n                  They filed another 13-G for December.31st, only 2 weeks later, and it shows that they sold virtually all their shares.\u00a0 Hmm, that\u2019s kind of odd isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 If they were buying those shares to go long, that would have been one bad trade don\u2019t you think?\u00a0 Look at the chart again\n              It doesn\u2019t look like they had much room to work with does it? Well, that is because they weren\u2019t buying the shares as some kind of investment, but rather to cover a short sale.\u00a0 You can see that on December.12th the price gaped up 30%, but then reversed 13% to close almost exactly where it opened, which was most likely this hedge fund dumping stock on  people like Ken, that sorry old retired  ...\n  There was also another short seller that exhibited the same \u201cbuying\u201d pattern as Empery.\n                      These guys are famous for this.\u00a0 They, among others, have been at this for a long long time.\n  Let\u2019s take another look at one of these little \u201cupticks\u201d.\n            On April.17th, HMNY was up almost 100% from the lows reached on April.03.\u00a0 Surely it would take something amazing for this kind of price increase to occur \u2014 no?\n           There\u2019s our man again!\u00a0 Remember him?!\u00a0 Just four months ago he said HMNY would be a $10 BILLION dollar business!\n               Isn\u2019t the timing just perfect.\u00a0 I\u2019ll help you skip through all the bullshit and just tell you what his conclusion was:\u00a0 he was bullish, he still thought it could go to $10 billion, and he was actually adding to his position!\u00a0 He also had a new mission statement: be the \u201cVoice of Retail\u201d.\n            Let\u2019s take a look at some of the other PR leading up to this surprise crash\n            Do any of you remember the Moviephone? No? Before smartphones went mainstream, most people had to call the theater to find out about movie showtimes, but today \u2014obviously \u2014this service is completely useless. In 2014, they had to discontinue their telephone service and switch to an app, but \u2014again, obviously \u2014you can easily find showtimes with a simple  ...\n           That CNN headline was just ecstatic though wasn\u2019t it?!\u00a0 BLOCKBUSTER DEAL! MOVIEPASS BUYS MOVIEPHONE!!! Way to be subtle there Captain Obvious. Anything for a buck though, right?\n  Then there was this guy who\u2019s main caveat was the catch phrase, \u201csell-offs create value\u201d.\n                The final chapter in this April fortnight pump show was this piece of news, reported on April. 16th, right before the price tanked.\u00a0 \u00a0Apparently even the great Verizon was now riding this fad.\u00a0 Verizon!\u00a0 Who would\u2019ve thought!\u00a0 If Verizon believes in it, surely it must go back up!\n           The problem with this article was that they failed to properly address one very important detail. The shares Verizon reported owning were part of HMNY \u2019s payment for Movietone, and Verizon was just following SEC beneficial ownership reporting rules by filing that 13-G. They didn \u2019t actually go out and buy HMNY \u2019s stock in the open  ...\n            If you look at the comments on ihub for that day, many people were having trouble understanding why it was up so much.\n                    This seems to be some kind of paid stock promoter.\u00a0 Notice how they put the word \u201chigher\u2019 in caps, then follow up by saying, \u201chey, just my \u201copinion\u201d\u201d, wink wink.\n            At least this guy knew what was up.\u00a0 He seemed to be the only one though\n              This guy is either being paid, or is just a sucker.\u00a0 Probably a mix of both\n            This is how the chart would have looked to your average trader.\u00a0 Looks very bullish doesn\u2019t it?\n                          On April.19th at 4:55pm, they announced news of an offering and the price tanked.\u00a0 As you can see by that volume bar, someone made a large purchase; most likely a short seller covering.\u00a0 They priced the offering after the close at $2.75 per share\n         It is very likely that this short seller covered with the offering shares.\u00a0 It\u2019s like an upside down pump and dump; almost guaranteed money if you know what you are doing, or even better, are privy to inside information concerning when the offering will be announced.\n  You artificially inflate the price with frivolous or even outright fake PR, pump it up by placing bids to attract speculators, then you artificially change the price by offering the shares in bulk 50% lower than the current price.\u00a0 How can you lose?\n  Do you think I\u2019m making this up?\u00a0 All speculation, no proof you say?\u00a0 The SEC and FINRA\u00a0 have recently censored people for engaging in this exact same activity.\u00a0 You can  read about it here, and  here\n        \u201cThe SEC alleges that a former day trader living in California, Steven Fishoff,  schemed with two friends and his brother-in-law to pose as legitimate portfolio managers and induce investment bankers to bring them \u201cover the wall \u201dand share confidential information  ...\n  Maybe by releasing this book Livermore was in fact trying to be the very \u201cWall Street Philanthropist \u201dhe so often sarcastically referred to.

We apologize for the inconvenience.  Learn more\n  Get ongoing access to funds with a home equity line of credit (HELOC) \u2014 a revolving form of credit. Since a HELOC is secured by the equity in your home, your interest rate may be lower than many unsecured types of credit.\n Your  variable interest rate won\u2019t go up more than 2% annually, and will never be more than 7% higher than where you started.\n  If you&#39;re worried about rising interest rates, you can convert all or part of your variable-rate balance to a fixed rate anytime during the  draw period.\n  When you open a Wells Fargo home equity line of credit, you won\u2019t have to pay closing costs. Plus, there are no application, annual, or prepayment fees.\n     For eligible customers, the minimum line of credit amount is $25,000. Here\u2019s what you need to know about accessing and repaying your line of credit.\n  Draw period . During the draw period \u2014 10 years and 1 month \u2014 you can withdraw money up to your available credit limit at any time.\n  Payments. You\u2019ll make principal-plus-interest payments during the draw period. The minimum required monthly payment is $100 (unless your total remaining balance and interest due is less than $100).\n  Because you\u2019ll have a variable rate, your monthly payment may change as the variable rate or your balance changes.\n  As your balance goes down, so does the amount you pay in interest (unless interest rates go up).\n  End of draw . The date your draw period ends and you can no longer withdraw money from your line of credit.\n  Repayment period . After the draw period ends, you must repay any remaining balance within a 20-year period.

"note_en": "Like everyone else, I got excited about the latest Ubuntu LTS release and installed it on day one. A week in, I\u2019m sorry to say that I leave disappointed. The amount of unready  snap features being effectively forced onto the users is affecting Ubuntu\u2019s usability and user-friendliness.\n   In 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu\u2019s Software Center was switched from being a .deb version of GNOME Software to a  snap app. The new snapped store can handle management of  snap applications and traditional .deb ones, but it can\u2019t install or remove Flatpak applications like the .deb version could.\n Users wanting to install Flatpak apps  need to revert to using the .deb version. It\u2019s not an ideal solution when previous Ubuntu Software releases could handle all three formats by default. In all, the latest Ubuntu Software is a step back.\n  Even without Flatpak apps, I was expecting the snap store to at least do well what it is supposed to. It turns out it prioritizes snap apps over .deb in search results at any cost! So you\u2019ll see a long list of non relevant search results of snap apps above .deb ones, even if your search term exactly matches the latter. -_-\n Needless to say, this is a serious issue for discovering software, especially for new users. Given that app discovery is so central to consumer operating systems, I\u2019m gonna say the new Ubuntu isn\u2019t only a step back, but is borderline unreliable.\n  On the latest Ubuntu, if you try to download the .deb version of Chromium using either the Software Store or command line, it acts as an alias to installing the snap version! Essentially, Chromium snap is shoved down your throat even if you explicitly asked for the .deb version. This is not cool Ubuntu \u2013 just because Chromium may be easier to maintain as a snap app doesn\u2019t justify this forced behavior.\n Besides, a typical user doesn\u2019t care how the app is managed in the backend, all they care about is how it works and snap apps are slow. I hate that Chromium\u2019s snap takes more than 10 seconds to load on cold boot on a freaking SSD, whereas .deb and Flatpak apps load in 1-2 seconds. Snaps are simply not fast enough to be default anything yet.\n  Snap applications auto-update and that\u2019s fine if Ubuntu wants to keep systems secure. But it can\u2019t even be turned off manually. Auto-updating of snaps can only be deferred at best, until at some point, like Windows, it auto-updates anyway. Even on metered connections, snaps auto-update anyway after some time.\n This is a deal breaker for people on limited bandwidth connections or who want to know exactly what they\u2019re updating and when they\u2019d like to. I never defer updating my system more than seven days in the worst case, but this auto-update snap thing is causing me issues like slowing down my connection abruptly and using a major chunk of my limited data for the day. My  discussion on the Ubuntu forums on the topic didn\u2019t go well, read the  full thread if interested.\n  Ubuntu was my first Linux-based operating system and is what attracted me to the ecosystem. I have a soft spot for it, especially the amazing Unity days. As such, it is disappointing to see this snap obsession that has taken over Ubuntu. An OS once lauded for its sane defaults and user friendliness is actively going against the user\u2019s will.\n What\u2019s especially concerning is that this is the Ubuntu version that millions of people will use for at least two years. I don\u2019t hate snaps but being forced to use it when clearly in a premature state is forcing me to hate it. Snaps simply aren\u2019t ready for system-wide daily usage and Ubuntu should\u2019ve known better. Perhaps Ubuntu should\u2019ve created a separate snap-based OS image, like Fedora\u2019s  Silverblue, and only swap the default when it\u2019s ready.\n Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\u2019 snap obsession has snapped me off of it.
