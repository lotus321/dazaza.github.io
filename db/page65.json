"note_en": "Renaissance Technologies, one of the world\u2019s largest and best-known hedge funds, has extended its recent run of poor performance and has recorded double-digit losses this year, according to investors.\n  Renaissance Technologies, the quantitative hedge fund firm founded by Jim Simons, lost almost 21% this year through the first week of June in its market-neutral vehicle.\n  Part of the decline for the Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha fund came this month amid volatility brought on by the coronavirus crisis,  according to Bloomberg. The fund lost almost 9% in the first week of June.\n  Renaissance\u2019s RIDA fund trades global stocks and runs a so-called \u2018market-neutral\u2019 portfolio that balances out bets on rising and falling prices. It also seeks to capitalise on trends and other patterns in futures markets.\n    A spokesman for the firm declined to comment on the returns, which were reported earlier by the  Financial Times.\n  This year\u2019s losses mark a U-turn in performance for RIDA, which has made money in each of the previous five calendar years, according to numbers sent to investors. The fund gained 4.2 per cent last year.\n  The firm\u2019s quantitative equity hedge fund rose 2.3% in May, Bloomberg reported last week. The Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund, which only trades U.S.-listed stocks that its computer models expect to rise, was down 11% this year through May.\n  Renaissance, which oversaw about $75 billion as of earlier this year, has long been one of the $3 trillion hedge fund industry\u2019s most profitable firms. The East Setauket, New York-based firm is best known for its Medallion fund, which is only open to executives and employees and has had annualized gains of roughly 40% over the past three decades.\n  The $75bn computer-driven fund firm, founded by former Cold War codebreaker Jim Simons, is having a difficult year navigating the increased market volatility brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.\n  Renaissance\u2019s equities-focused funds were among some of the most high-profile casualties of the coronavirus-led market rout in early March, putting the firm on track for one of its worst annual performances. The firm declined to comment on the numbers.\n    The Long Island-based group had managed to pare back some of its earlier losses as markets recovered from the initial shock of a global economic shutdown to stem the pandemic, but its recent performance woes gave back those gains.\n  Founded by Mr Simons in 1982, Renaissance is one of the most influential and secretive firms in the hedge fund industry. Its flagship hedge fund Medallion was so successful that it ejected outside investors in 2005, and now just manages the money of the firm\u2019s employees.\n  Financial markets have proved hard to time for many traders this year. The fallout from the pandemic provoked the US market\u2019s fastest descent into bear market territory, before a massive wave of stimulus from global central banks and governments prompted a sharp rebound that briefly took the S&amp;P 500 into positive territory for the year.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 23:00:22", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "The UK&#39;s NHS is stepping back from the development of its homegrown solution and instead turning to the system proposed by an Apple and Google partnership to power its  coronavirus contact tracing app. The change was announced and confirmed by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on 18 June.\n The move is a major change of direction for the app. Development and discussion around the app had seemingly stalled in recent weeks, leading many to suspect that it wasn&#39;t working the way that NHSX - the technology group responsible for the project - had hoped.\n The shift will see in-built contact tracing from Apple&#39;s iPhone and Google&#39;s Android devices providing the information about close proximity contacts, allowing a network of contacts to be alerted should a user test positive for the virus. However, the DHSC has confirmed that the app will integrate the learnings from its trials on the Isle of Wight.\n &#34;...we\u00a0have agreed to\u00a0share\u00a0our own\u00a0innovative work\u00a0on estimating distance\u00a0between app users\u00a0with Google and Apple, work that we hope will benefit\u00a0others, while using their solution to address some of the specific technical challenges identified through our rigorous testing,&#34; says a joint statement from Baroness Dido Harding, executive chair of NHS Test and Trace, and Matthew Gould, CEO of NHSX.\n It&#39;s expected that the NHS app will look the same as the version currently in testing on the Isle of Wight, but the underlying mechanics of the application will now be substantially different.\n  The Google-Apple system works on a &#34;decentralised&#34; model, meaning that the data remains on the phone and anonymously notifies other users when triggered by a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. This information is not available to the NHS, meaning that authorities cannot gather the data and analyse it.\n Originally, that had been on the UK&#39;s wishlist, allowing the identification of hotspots so that action could be taken and to allow wider epidemiological data gathering, in a so-called &#34;centralised&#34; system. Privacy advocates had raised warning flags about this approach, preferring the decentralised model proposed by the tech giants.\n When Apple and Google first proposed their own system of contact tracing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock had said that there was potential to use the system; indeed, it was reported in  by the Financial Times in May 2020 that NHSX was commissioning a second app so that the UK could use either system moving forward.\n On the announcement that the NHS was switching to the Google-Apple system, Hancock said: &#34;Countries across the globe have faced challenges in developing an app which gets all of these elements right, but through ongoing international collaboration\u00a0we\u00a0hope\u00a0to learn, improve and\u00a0find a solution which will\u00a0strengthen our global response to this virus.&#34;\n From the outset, technology experts had warned that any contact tracing system that didn&#39;t use the Google-Apple approach would struggle to be effective, because of the way that Apple handles access to Bluetooth when apps are running in the background. Bluetooth is the essential element of the system and although the original NHSX app claimed to have found a way around the problem, we suspect that this is still part of the issue.\n Using core code from Google and Apple should mean that any app based on their system should be more efficient in terms of battery life, as well as having the necessary access to the device&#39;s hardware. At the same time, the DHSC is saying that it is sharing its own findings based around contact proximity with the aim of improving the system that Apple and Google offers.\n Although this is a change of direction, there&#39;s still no timeline for the app&#39;s release.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 22:59:40", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "The cost of homeownership is outpacing the cost of renting across the United States, and the discrepancy between the two is rising sharply in parts of the Southeast, Midwest and Pacific Northwest, according to the latest national index by professors at Florida Atlantic and Florida International universities.    The  Beracha, Hardin &amp; Johnson Buy vs. Rent Index determines whether consumers will create wealth faster in buying a home and building equity or renting the same property and reinvesting the money they would have spent on ownership, such as taxes, insurance and maintenance. The index examines the entire U.S. housing market but isolates 23 key metropolitan areas, factoring in  , rents, mortgage rates, investment returns, property taxes, insurance and home maintenance costs.\n  The quarterly numbers show that Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Miami, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Seattle and Portland, Oregon, are all significantly above their long-term fundamental home price levels. That means renting clearly is the better option in those areas, according to Ken H. Johnson, Ph.D., a real estate economist within FAU&#39;s College of Business.\n  &#34;These   are the most at risk for home price declines, including any future negative impacts to housing values brought about by COVID-19,&#34; he said. &#34;We&#39;re still waiting to see how the pandemic will affect the housing market.&#34;\n  The remaining metros tracked in the index\u2014Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, San Diego and St. Louis\u2014appear to be under little or no pressure in terms of the demand for homeownership. That suggests it&#39;s a toss-up between renting and buying in those areas.\n  Homeownership traditionally was considered the far better option than renting for building wealth, but the historic housing crash from 2006-2011 changed that perception for many Americans, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will soon be felt. The buy vs. rent index, first published in 2013, shows that even when home prices are rising, renting can be equally or more lucrative for disciplined investors.\n  Still, renters who would not invest the money they would have spent on ownership are better off buying a home, according to Eli Beracha, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Hollo School of Real Estate at FIU.\n  &#34;Homeownership doesn&#39;t necessarily generate attractive rates of return, but it does force consumers to be more mindful of their expenses,&#34; he said. &#34;Renters should be honest with themselves. If they aren&#39;t going to put their extra money into the stock market, then the safer option over the long run would be to own.&#34;\n  The index&#39;s housing price numbers cover all transactions for the months of January, February and March, before much of the effect from the coronavirus pandemic was felt nationwide. Johnson and Beracha agree that the timing makes it difficult to predict what COVID-19 may do to   prices.\n  &#34;If effective treatments and a vaccine are developed quickly, COVID-19&#39;s impact on U.S. housing   should be minimal,&#34; Johnson said. &#34;But if the nation remains under a long-term threat from the virus, the potential for significant   price declines is high.&#34;           Citation: Renting a home is clearly better than buying in much of the nation (2020, June 18) retrieved 18 June 2020 from https://phys.org/news/2020-06-renting-home-nation.html\n  This document is subject to copyright.

"note_en": "Recently, the Go team announced an  updated draft design for their Generics in Go proposal. It goes into a lot of details about why certain decisions were made, implementation details, etc.\n In this article, my goal is to summarise the major upcoming changes, as the whole draft design can be a mouthful for many.\n I will provide some code snippets to demonstrate the major features as well as give you the chance to experiment yourself with them, thanks to the  new Go playground with support for generics.\n   Here\u2019s how a generic function looks like without any constraints on the type parameter:\n  To add constraints on the generic type, you can demand that it implements a given interface:\n    Constraints on multiple type parameters are written the same way you write function argument types:\n     Instead of constraining types based on a set of methods, you can constraint them based on a set of supported types. For example, you could specify that you accept a generic type which can only be an int or a long.\n This allows you to e.g. leverage operators like \u201cless than\u201d, \u201cgreater than\u201d, which are only available for basic types in Go:\n  You also have an out-of-the-box constraint called  comparable, which constraints types to those which support the == and != operators.\n  Interfaces using these constraints \u2013 type lists and/or comparable, cannot be implemented by a struct.\n   Structs can be defined using a generic type. Once specified, in the type declaration, there is no need to specify the type for all the functions of the type:\n  You can also do that in interfaces. This is especially useful when a type constraint depends on itself.\n E.g. you have a type constraint for  T, which requires an  Equal method, which accepts a  T parameter:\n  In case you need to specify a type parameter, who has a state-modifying function (e.g. a setter), then you can specify a pointer type constraint:\n  Notice how this example above requires that you explicitly specify the type you\u2019ll use in the function \u2013  FromStrings(Settable)\u2026\n This is because whenever the type is not present as a function argument, the compiler cannot infer the actual type once the code is compiled.

Shares were down 47% by 06:40 ET.\n It added that the delay in getting its accounts signed off by EY could mean loans of around 2 billion euros would be called in early this week.\n Wirecard shares plunged more than 60% on Thursday as the German payments giant postponed its annual results once again and said auditors could not confirm the existence of 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in cash on its balance sheet.\n The Munich-headquartered company said in a  statement Thursday morning that auditor EY couldn&#39;t find the cash balances\u00a0\u2014 which represent roughly a quarter of its balance sheet. There were indications that &#34;spurious balance confirmations&#34; had been made by a trustee to &#34;deceive the auditor\u00a0and create a wrong perception of the existence of such cash balances,&#34; it added.\n  &#34;The Wirecard management board is working intensively together with the auditor towards a clarification of the situation,&#34; the firm said. It added that the delay in getting its accounts signed off by EY could mean loans of around 2 billion euros would be called in early this week.\n Wirecard&#39;s share price cratered immediately after the news, and was trading almost 64% lower by 8:40 a.m. ET.\n The embattled group has fallen from its position as  one of Germany&#39;s top financial technology darlings to a company mired in controversy due to  allegations of fraud. The firm was at one point last year worth more than 24 billion euros and even replaced Commerzbank in the German blue-chip index, but has since seen its market capitalization decline to just 6.5 billion euros\n The Financial Times has published a series of reports on its investigation into Wirecard&#39;s accounting practices. According to those reports, which began back in January 2019, Wirecard&#39;s Singapore office tried to inflate revenue through forged and backdated contracts. Another story in October claimed that Wirecard&#39;s staff appeared to conspire to inflate sales and profits at subsidiaries in Dubai and Dublin and mislead EY.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 22:38:13",

"note_en": "Executives and engineers from Facebook\u2019s games division submitted their new app,  Facebook Gaming, to Apple last month for approval to offer it in the iPhone maker\u2019s App Store.\n Apple considered Facebook\u2019s application for a few weeks. This month, it delivered its verdict: denied.\n The Facebook team was not surprised. It wasn\u2019t the first time Apple had said no to the Facebook Gaming app. Or the second. Or even the third.\n Since February, Apple has rejected at least five versions of Facebook Gaming, according to three people with knowledge of the companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Each time, the people said, Apple cited its rules that prohibit apps with the \u201cmain purpose\u201d of distributing casual games.\n Facebook Gaming may also have been hurt by appearing to compete with Apple\u2019s own sales of games, two of the people said. Games are by far the most lucrative category of mobile apps worldwide. Apple\u2019s App Store, the only officially approved place for iPhone and iPad users to find new games and other programs, generated about $15 billion in revenue last year.\n Apple\u2019s rejections of the app from Facebook, a fellow Silicon Valley powerhouse, illustrate the control it exerts over the mobile software and entertainment ecosystem \u2014 clout that regulators are increasingly examining. On Tuesday, the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, said it had  opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple to determine if the terms that the company imposes on app developers violate competition rules.\n \u201cWe need to ensure that Apple\u2019s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in charge of competition policy.\n This week, Basecamp publicly complained that its  new email app, Hey, had been denied from the App Store because it charged customers outside Apple\u2019s payment system, keeping the giant company from collecting its 30 percent cut.\n \u201cWe keep trying to find logic, consistency in Apple\u2019s App Store decisions,\u201d David Hansson, Basecamp\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer,  wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe answer is much more basic: power. Apple can do what they want, when they want, so they do.\u201d\n Mr. Hansson added that the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division had contacted him earlier to talk about Apple.\n  Apple, which will hold its annual developer conference next week, said the App Store has many apps that offer casual games and that follow its rules, including the main Facebook app.\n  Apple has long taken a \u201c walled garden\u201d approach to its mobile devices while its main mobile competitor, Google and its Android operating system, has adopted a more laissez-faire philosophy. Both companies take 30 percent of most purchases on their app stores, leaving 70 percent to app developers.\n \u201cApple and Google Play have always pursued different strategies for their app stores, which align with the closed ecosystem \u2014 Apple \u2014 versus open ecosystem \u2014 Google \u2014 company attributes,\u201d said Candice Mudrick, head of market analysis at Newzoo, a game industry research firm.\n Apple has said it monitors its App Store ecosystem closely to ensure the highest standards of quality and security. According to its  App Store principles: \u201cWhen you download an app, it should work as promised. We carefully review each app and require developers to follow strict guidelines on privacy, design and business models.\u201d\n But over time, that has increasingly grated on some app developers. The European Union investigation into Apple was spurred by a  complaint last year from Spotify, whose music-streaming service competes with Apple Music. Spotify and others have criticized Apple for charging a fee of up to 30 percent on digital services sold through its App Store, arguing that it amounts to a tax that violates competition laws.\n Facebook announced its Gaming app in April as people were sheltering in place from the coronavirus pandemic and playing more video games. For the social network, the new app was a way to more deeply engage its users.\n The free app has three main components: watching live streams of other people playing games; socially networking with other gamers; and playing simple games like Words With Friends and Thug Life. On both Apple and Android devices, those simple games can be delivered within Facebook Gaming\u2019s app using software called HTML5.\n  Google quickly approved Facebook Gaming for its Google Play app store and began  offering the app worldwide on April 20. In the Android version of Facebook Gaming, a catalog of simple games is presented by category and with colorful icons. Some of those games allow players to spend real money for in-game purchases.\n Facebook initially submitted its Gaming app to Apple for approval in late February, said the people with knowledge of the situation. Apple rejected that version, they said, citing  Section 4.7 of its app rules, which state that HTML5 games are allowed \u201cas long as code distribution isn\u2019t the main purpose of the app\u201d and \u201cthe code is not offered in a store or store-like interface,\u201d among other restrictions.\n But the initial version of the Gaming app that Facebook showed to Apple was similar to the Android version, listing games by category in a manner that could be interpreted as \u201cstore-like.\u201d\n Trying to get the Gaming app through Apple\u2019s review process, Facebook then changed the design of the presentation of games in several ways, the people said. The colorful icons were removed in favor of a bland listing. The different games categories were removed to list all games at once. The ability to sort games was also taken away.\n Facebook also included a version that looked almost exactly like how such games are presented already within the main Facebook app on Apple devices, which is a single unalphabetized, unsortable list, the people said.\n  In Facebook\u2019s most recent submission, the Gaming app did not include a separate tab for playable games and included no way for the user to choose from a wide selection of games to play, the people said. Instead, that version suggested certain games within the user\u2019s news and activity feed.\n  Since then, Facebook has been weighing its next move. The company is considering releasing Facebook Gaming on Apple devices without playable games at all, the people with knowledge of the social network said. Another option, they said, is continuing to make playable games even more difficult for users to find within the app.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 22:19:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A newly discovered spyware effort attacked users through 32 million downloads of extensions to Google\u2019s market-leading Chrome web browser, researchers at Awake Security told Reuters, highlighting the tech industry\u2019s failure to protect browsers as they are used more for email, payroll and other sensitive functions.\n Alphabet Inc\u2019s (  GOOGL.O) Google said it removed more than 70 of the malicious add-ons from its official Chrome Web Store after being alerted by the researchers last month.\n \u201cWhen we are alerted of extensions in the Web Store that violate our policies, we take action and use those incidents as training material to improve our automated and manual analyses,\u201d Google spokesman Scott Westover told Reuters.\n Most of the free extensions purported to warn users about questionable websites or convert files from one format to another. Instead, they siphoned off browsing history and data that provided credentials for access to internal business tools.\n Based on the number of downloads, it was the most far-reaching malicious Chrome store campaign to date, according to Awake co-founder and chief scientist Gary Golomb.\n Google declined to discuss how the latest spyware compared with prior campaigns, the breadth of the damage, or why it did not detect and remove the bad extensions on its own despite past promises to supervise offerings more closely.\n It is unclear who was behind the effort to distribute the malware. Awake said the developers supplied fake contact information when they submitted the extensions to Google.\n \u201cAnything that gets you into somebody\u2019s browser or email or other sensitive areas would be a target for national espionage as well as organized crime,\u201d said former National Security Agency engineer Ben Johnson, who founded security companies Carbon Black and Obsidian Security.\n The extensions were designed to avoid detection by antivirus companies or security software that evaluates the reputations of web domains, Golomb said.\n If someone used the browser to surf the web on a home computer, it would connect to a series of websites and transmit information, the researchers found. Anyone using a corporate network, which would include security services, would not transmit the sensitive information or even reach the malicious versions of the websites.\n \u201cThis shows how attackers can use extremely simple methods to hide, in this case, thousands of malicious domains,\u201d Golomb said.\n All of the domains in question, more than 15,000 linked to each other in total, were purchased from a small registrar in Israel, Galcomm, known formally as CommuniGal Communication Ltd.\n  In an email exchange, Galcomm owner Moshe Fogel told Reuters that his company had done nothing wrong.\n \u201cGalcomm is not involved, and not in complicity with any malicious activity whatsoever,\u201d Fogel wrote. \u201cYou can say exactly the opposite, we cooperate with law enforcement and security bodies to prevent as much as we can.\u201d\n Fogel said there was no record of the inquiries Golomb said he made in April and again in May to the company\u2019s email address for reporting abusive behavior, and he asked for a list of suspect domains. Reuters sent him that list three times without getting a substantive response.\n The Internet Corp for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees registrars, said it had received few complaints about Galcomm over the years, and none about malware.\n While deceptive extensions have been a problem for years, they are getting worse. They initially spewed unwanted advertisements, and now are more likely to install additional malicious programs or track where users are and what they are doing for government or commercial spies.\n  Malicious developers have been using Google\u2019s Chrome Store as a conduit for a long time. After one in 10 submissions was deemed malicious, Google said in 2018  here it would improve security, in part by increasing human review.\n But in February, independent researcher Jamila Kaya and Cisco Systems\u2019 Duo Security uncovered  here a similar Chrome campaign that stole data from about 1.7 million users. Google joined the investigation and found 500 fraudulent extensions.\n \u201cWe do regular sweeps to find extensions using similar techniques, code and behaviors,\u201d Google\u2019s Westover said, in identical language to what Google gave out after Duo\u2019s report.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 22:01:48", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "Project Mercury was literally having trouble getting off the ground. In Augustof 1960, after the first Mercury-Atlas exploded in flight, the major journal inthe aerospace business,  Missiles and Rockets, stated: &#34;NASA&#39;s Mercurymanned satellite program appears to be plummeting the United States toward a newhumiliating disaster in the East-West space race. The program is more than oneyear behind the original schedule and is expected to slip to two. It no longeroffers any realistic hope of beating Russia in launching the first man intoorbit, much less to serve as an early stepping-stone for reaching the Moon.&#34; The testing of the Mercury capsule escape system was carried out at the WallopsIsland Station just below the Maryland-Virginia border. This was a Langley testfacility for all sorts of &#34;sounding,&#34; or high-altitude research rockets. Thetests of the escape system were about 50 percent successful. While we weregetting ready at the Cape, one of the Mercury tests at Wallops failedspectacularly on November 8. Sixteen seconds after launch the escape andjettison rockets fired prematurely, thus leaving the capsule attached to thebooster rocket, which reached a ten-mile apex and then came screaming back toEarth, destroying the capsule at impact. The Mercury program used two booster rockets \u2014 the Redstone and the Atlas. Bothwere derivatives of military systems but with vastly different capabilities. TheRedstone was an Army battlefield rocket. It would be used to start the capsulesystems qualification test flight and, if that was successful, for two ballisticmanned missions. The ballistic missions were to be about twenty minutes induration, reaching a maximum altitude of about 130 miles and providing a shortweightless period before reentry. The Atlas was an Air Force intercontinentalmissile and was to be used for both ballistic and orbital Mercury missions. Thefirst three missions were ballistic, to continue the booster and capsulequalification, test the tracking network, and provide experience for the MCCteam. The orbital testing would continue the qualification testing using themechanical man and a chimpanzee before the manned orbital flights. When Mercury-Atlas 1 exploded in flight, we fell about one year behind in theschedule, so a lot was riding on the first Mercury-Redstone flight, MR-1.Kraft&#39;s team arrived on November 13 for the MR-1 launch, now only eight daysaway. Once again my guardian angel, Johnson, arrived to save my bacon. He took aplace to the right of the console and punched up the buttons of the intercomduring our simulation dress rehearsal. Immediately, a half dozen different conversations flooded through my headset. Itreminded me of the cool, almost casual but terse and clear voice chatter thatcame up on the tactical frequency when things heated up during the time I was inKorea directing air strikes on ground targets. As I listened, I picked up thevoices of the test conductors. Johnson broke out some thick documents andadvised Kraft of the page and sequence of the countdown. It was fortunate thatthis was just a test. It gave Johnson a chance to brief me on the countdownprocess, get to know the people talking on the loops and Mercury Control&#39;s rolein the test. At intervals, Johnson encouraged me as the MCC procedures controller to makesuggestions to Kraft or one of the other controllers. Throughout the test, heglanced around the room and made mental notes about what people at the variousconsole positions should be doing or doing in a different way. Periodically, Iwould print out a message and call the ground communications controller.Eshelman would rush into the room to pick up the message, put it on the Teletypeline, and then rush back with a confirming copy of the transmitted text. Afterseveral hours, I picked up the routine of the count and felt comfortable, aslong as all was going well. This first mission in which I would play a role was a ballistic test of aRedstone booster rocket and a Mercury capsule. The Redstone&#39;s engine wasscheduled to burn for two and one half minutes. After the booster engine cutoff, the escape tower separated from the capsule by firing the tower ringattachment bolts and igniting the tower escape rocket. Then after the boosterthrust had decayed, explosive bolts would fire, followed by the firing of threesmall posigrade solid rockets, to separate the capsule from the booster.(&#34;Posigrade&#34; is the term used for adding velocity in the direction of flight, inthis instance the small rockets used to separate the Mercury capsule from thebooster. Retrograde rockets fire opposite to the direction of flight.) TheRedstone boosted the spacecraft to an altitude of 130 miles before it started toarc downward. At 20,000 feet, the capsule&#39;s drogue parachutes would deploy, stabilize itsmotion, and slow it down sufficiently to allow the main parachutes to deploysafely. Then the landing sequence would begin. The entire mission was planned tolast only sixteen minutes. After the countdown simulation test we began trainingfor the brief actual flight of the Redstone. For three days we rehearsed,calling out events and issuing backup commands to the automatic sequences. During the simulation run-through our instructors sat watching us from theirvantage point at the top row of the consoles and played magnetic tapes into thetelemetry and radar systems, which in turn drove the controller&#39;s meters andplot board displays. If all else failed, we would be handed a written question,like a pop quiz in school. You had to stand up in front of the entire MissionControl Center team and say, &#34;Flight! A new problem has shown up and this iswhat I am going to do about it.&#34; You took it seriously. God help you if youcouldn&#39;t come up with an answer \u2014 instantly. The launch complex from which we would fire the Redstone consisted of the launchpad, service tower, and a blockhouse for launch site command and control.Servicing the pad was a network of power and communications cables, and pipescarrying fuel and other fluids. The blockhouses were igloolike structures thatsat about 230 meters from the pad and looked somewhat like squat World War IIpillboxes. Atlas blockhouses were a bit different \u2014 twelve-sided concretebunkers with walls three meters thick and domed tops, embedded in thirteenmeters of sand. Earlier blockhouses used a viewing slit with a thickquartz/glass window. Later on periscopes were added; they afforded a view ofsuch things as the fuel tanks and cable trenches. The blockhouses had to beclose enough for direct viewing and far enough from the booster to survive anexplosion. (Five percent of the early boosters exploded shortly after liftoff.) The blockhouse team was a mixture of German rocket scientists, former Armytechnicians, and booster contractors. The Germans were most often found talkingin their native language, huddled over their displays and praying for things togo right. In addition to von Braun&#39;s colleagues, the blockhouse capsuleengineers were drawn from a broad talent pool, mostly from aircraft (soon to becalled aerospace) contractors. Kraft&#39;s team was made up of engineers who camefrom all sorts of backgrounds, put together like a pickup softball team. Thecapsule engineers came from the NASA Space Task Group, network controllers fromthe Air Force, facility technicians from Bendix, and the Mercury Control CenterCapComs from the initial group of seven astronauts. Three-man operations teamswere deployed to the thirteen Project Mercury manned tracking stations toprovide global tracking, data, and voice communications data coverage. Theleader of the three-man team was the CapCom, and he was responsible for sitemission readiness, real-time mission support, and status reporting to theMercury Control flight director. During the manned missions he provided thecommunications with the astronaut in the capsule, hence the term &#34;CapCom.&#34; The teams at the thirteen manned tracking stations were provided by Kraft&#39;soperations organization. With high-risk time-critical decisions, the astronautcorps believed that only astronauts should talk to the astronaut in the capsule.In the Mercury Control Center and at the blockhouse, CapComs were selected fromthe Mercury astronauts and they were often sent to tracking stations designatedas mission critical. During this period, the American space program drew on some military resourcesas well as those of NASA. By contrast, the Russian program was part of theirmilitary. Soviet hardware, software, and personnel were military, albeit withsome modification \u2014 spacecraft instead of warheads sitting on top of boostersthat, like our Atlas, originated in military programs developed for strategicwarfare. Over time the Russian effort would become somewhat more civilian innature, but from inception, NASA&#39;s operations would be separated by a kind offirewall from military operations and personnel. In the first decades of the race into space the Russians enjoyed the advantagesof running a program powered by the virtually unrestricted resources and fundingof a military that, in a command economy, came first in economic priority. Wewere on a somewhat more modest footing in the early days. That would changedramatically thanks to President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Johnsonpushing for the funding and resources that would enable an explicitly civilianspace program to succeed. In Mercury Control the only controllers reporting administratively to ChrisKraft were the trajectory operators, Tecwyn (Tec) Roberts, and Carl Huss, whom Ihad yet to meet; Howard Kyle, who doubled for Kraft at the flight directorconsole; Paul Johnson; and myself. The capsule engineers assigned to work withthe MCC team understandably focused on hardware rather than flight operationsand had their hands full checking out the spacecraft in Hangar S, and theylooked at training in the Mercury Control Center as a waste of their time. Thecore of the engineering staff was based at Space Task Group headquarters atLangley Research Center. When McDonnell Aircraft sent a capsule to the Cape theengineers would come down and check it out in Hangar S. Despite a certain amount of confusion about who should be doing what, since wewere inventing it all as we went along, we were moving quickly to the crunchpoint. To my dismay, two days before launch at the readiness review, Johnsontook me aside and said he would not be there. He had to go to the Canary Islandsto work out a tracking site problem. He wished me good luck. November 21, 1960, Mercury-Redstone 1 Only one month and four days after I was hired, I was at the procedures console.Thanks to Johnson&#39;s unflagging coaching and the training we had done, I had noproblems and felt comfortable with the mechanics. But I had a long way to gobefore I would have that sense of &#34;being ahead of the airplane&#34; or &#34;ahead of thepower curve&#34; as pilots put it \u2014 having the experience to anticipate what could happen rather than just reacting to what was happening at themoment. As the countdown proceeded, I noticed a change in the intensity of theatmosphere in the control room. I had felt that before when I signed off myaircraft \u2014 accepted it as ready for flight \u2014 at Holloman. Although the job wasdifferent, the emotional content was the same. Controllers were going throughthe same gut churning as we had had prior to a B-52 test flight. During a holdin the countdown to fix a leak in the Redstone&#39;s hydrogen peroxide system thatfueled the control thrusters, Kraft turned to me and said, &#34;How about getting mea couple of cartons of milk from the roach coach?&#34; (Mercury Control, like allthe other Cape facilities, was out in a vast palmetto swamp, about half a mileoff the main road. A lunch wagon, known as the roach coach, pulled by a pickuptruck, made its rounds to the test stands, camera trackers, and other stations.The loudspeakers would announce its arrival when it stopped at Mercury Controlthree times each day. The menu was pretty limited \u2014 but it did offer milk.) Forthe first time I realized that behind Kraft&#39;s calm exterior he had the samesensations I felt \u2014 of squirrels running around in my stomach \u2014 as weapproached launch. The launch countdown progressed without any major incident. As liftoffapproached, I leaned back and peered at the video image on Kraft&#39;s consolecoming from a camera focused on the Redstone standing on the launch pad.Precisely at zero on the clock, there was a great cloud of smoke. Kraft lookedstartled, and then he leaned forward intently. The TV cameraman momentarily losttrack as he panned the camera upward, and, for a few seconds, there was nothingon the screen but a smoky sky. From my position, it looked much like the rocketsI had launched from aircraft. I was surprised at how quickly the Redstone hadaccelerated and moved out of sight. Then after a few seconds the camera panned down. Although smoke still obscuredthe launch pad, the vague outline of the Redstone was still there. Kraft&#39;s facewas incredulous. He stammered for a few seconds, then called out, &#34;Booster, whatthe hell happened?&#34; Our booster engineer in the control room came from the Marshall Redstone team.After liftoff he was responsible for reporting booster status \u2014 engine andguidance \u2014 to Kraft&#39;s team. If something was wrong he was supposed to give us aheads-up so the trajectory people in Mercury Control could better assess whatthey were seeing on their radar plot boards. Now he reverted to his nativeGerman as he tried to figure out what happened and, more importantly, what theblockhouse team should do about it. All hell broke loose. The Redstone hadlifted a few inches off the launch pad and then the engine shut down. By somemiracle, the rocket had landed back on the launcher cradle. When the escape tower cut loose, unguided and spewing flame, it corkscrewed toan altitude of about 4,000 feet. As it plummeted back to Earth, loudspeakersaround the facility blared out warnings to the astronauts, engineers, and VIPsin the viewing area to take cover. The escape tower ultimately landed some 1,200feet from the launch pad. The launch team in the blockhouse was as stunned as Mercury Control. Boostercontinued talking in German to his counterparts in the blockhouse, oblivious toKraft&#39;s repeated calls. Television cameras showed the events on the pad as themain and reserve landing parachutes popped out of their stowage compartment atthe nose of the capsule, ejected upward and partially opened up. Initially, theyhung limply, then they slowly inflated and caught the sea breeze. At the sametime strips of tinfoil were ejected from the capsule and spilled over the sidesof the booster and capsule. (The strips, or chaff, were used to help radar trackthe capsule as it was slowed down by the parachute and headed for splashdown, orwater landing, in the Atlantic Ocean.) Every controller held his breath, afraidthe parachute would topple the rocket and cause an explosion. The intercom that had been quiet was now busily filled with directions,observations, and opinions. Everything that happened, although it had taken onlyseconds, passed before me in slow motion. Then it finally clicked.  We hadlaunched the escape tower. The Redstone rocket, surrounded by smoke, was armed and fueled but still sittingon the launch pad. Kraft told everyone to calm down, but Booster was still onthe hot line, interrogating the blockhouse in German. We all could see the angerglowing in Kraft&#39;s eyes as he walked over and yanked Booster&#39;s headset cordloose from the console, saying, &#34;Speak to  me, dammit!&#34; Chaos continued for several minutes until Booster, in halting English, told usthat the Redstone engines had fired and the rocket had lifted off the pad enoughto drop the umbilical, the bundle of cables that connected launch control withthe booster and that normally fell away right after liftoff. Then the engineinexplicably shut down. The Mercury capsule, sensing the booster&#39;s engineshutdown, acted as if it were in orbit and sent the command to jettison theescape tower. The capsule, not sensing any further acceleration, acted as if itwere in the recovery phase and so deployed the parachutes. We now had a liverocket on the pad, a fully pressurized Redstone; and, since the umbilicals haddisconnected, we had no control of it. The booster&#39;s destruct system was armedand there was no way to secure the system. No one had any idea what to do next. Kraft walked over to me, eyes blazing. Pointing at Booster he snapped, &#34;The damnGermans still haven&#39;t learned who they work for. Everyone in this control roommust work for me.&#34; We sat stunned, helpless in Mercury Control. We had notechnical data on the spacecraft or the launch system beyond a simple manual,the equivalent of an owner&#39;s manual for a new car. All of us were still thinkingin aircraft, not rocket, terms \u2014 and we were definitely behind the power curve.We had no data to work with because we weren&#39;t smart enough to know what wereally needed. We were dealing with a  new control room, a  newnetwork,  new procedures, and entirely  new jobs, doing somethingthat we had never done before, something almost alien to our nature. A tentative proposal came from the blockhouse to reconnect the umbilical. Thechances of people getting killed doing this were discussed and we decided thatit could not be done safely. The next, and equally desperate, suggestion was toget a cherry picker (a kind of crane or boom with a man-holding bucket on theend of it, like those used by telephone and utility line repair crews) and cutthe nylon parachute risers. This would at least eliminate the threat of windfilling the parachute and toppling the Redstone, but this idea was alsodiscarded because of the risk to personnel. All the while we were apprehensivelywatching a partially inflated parachute and praying that the sea breeze did notpick up, fill the parachute, and topple the whole damn rocket over. After impatiently listening to a pretty far-out proposal to depressurize therocket by using a rifle to shoot holes in the fuel and oxidizer tanks, Kraftsputtered and growled, &#34;Dammit, that&#39;s no way to do it! They sound like a bunchthat just started spring training!&#34; Even to a rookie like me, shooting a hole inthe tanks did not seem to be a sound plan. Kraft listened intently as each of the crazy schemes came across the loops,everybody desperately searching for a way out. Then one of the test conductorscame up with a plan that made sense. &#34;The winds are forecast to remain calm, soif we wait until tomorrow morning, the batteries will deplete, the relays andvalves will go to the normally open condition. As the oxidizer warms up, thetank vents will open, removing the flight pressure. With the boosterdepressurized and batteries depleted, it will then be safe to approach therocket.&#34; Kraft nodded and growled at his controllers, &#34;That is the first rule of flightcontrol. If you don&#39;t know what to do,  don&#39;t do anything!&#34; We securedMercury Control and the blockhouse gang got saddled with the unenviable job ofnervously watching over the Redstone throughout the night. &#34;Doing nothing&#34;worked: by early the next morning, the batteries were depleted, the destructsystem disarmed, and the pressure relieved. The capsule and the Redstone rockethad survived with only minor damages to the tail fins. This fiasco was the most embarrassing episode yet for the young engineers of theMercury program. The history books call this mission, sardonically butaccurately, &#34;The Four-Inch Flight.&#34; While the badly shaken booster engineersfrantically worked on finding out just what had happened, I promised myself thatwhen I returned to Langley I would use the same technique that had worked for meflying airplanes or flight-testing at Holloman. I would get to know as manytechnici\n......", "posttime": "2020-06-18 22:00:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u82f1\u5bf8,option,\u6d4b\u8bd5",

"note_en": "Yesterday talks between the EU and the US on a digital services tax broke down after U.S. treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, walked out \u2014 saying they\u2019d failed to make any progress, per  Reuters.\n The EU has been eyeing  levying a tax of between 2% and 6% on the local revenues of platform giants.\n  Today the European Commission dug in in response to the US move, with commissioner Paolo Gentiloni reiterating the need for \u201cone digital tax\u201d to adapt to what he dubbed \u201cthe reality of the new century\u201d \u2014 and calling for \u201cunderstanding\u201d in the global negotiation.\n However he also repeated the Commission\u2019s warning that it will push ahead alone if necessary, saying that if the US\u2019 decision to quit talks means achieving global consensus impossible it will put \u201ca new European proposal on the table\u201d.\n C\u2019\u00e8 bisogno di una  #DigitalTax adeguata alla realt\u00e0 del nuovo secolo. Serve un\u2019intesa nel negoziato globale. Se lo stop americano la rendesse impossibile, la  @EU_Commission metter\u00e0 sul tavolo una nuova proposta europea.\n Following the break down of talks, France also warned it will go ahead with a digital tax on tech giants this year \u2014 reversing an earlier suspension that had been intended to grease the negotiations.\n The  New York Times reports French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, describing the US walk-out as \u201ca provocation\u201d, and complaining about the country \u201csystematically threatening\u201d allies with sanctions.\n The issue of \u2018fair taxes\u2019 for platforms has been slow burning in Europe for years, with politicians grilling tech execs in public over how little they contribute to national coffers and even  urging the public to boycott services like Amazon (with little success).\n Updating the tax system to account for digital giants is also front and center for  Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s Commission \u2014 which is responding to the widespread regional public anger over how little tech giants pay in relation to the local revenue they generate.\n European Commission president von der Leyen, who took up her mandate at the back end of last year, has said \u201curgent\u201d reform of the tax system is needed \u2014 warning at the start of 2020 that the  European Union   would be prepared to go it alone on \u201ca fair digital tax\u201d if no global accord was reached by the end of this year.\n At the same time, a number of European countries have been pushing ahead with their own proposals to tax big tech \u2014 including the UK, which started  levying a 2% digital services tax on local revenue in April; and France, which has set out a plan to  tax tech giants 3% of their local revenues.\n This gives the Commission another clear reason to act, given its  raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to reduce fragmentation of the EU\u2019s Single Market.\n Although it faces internal challenges on achieving agreement across Member States, given some smaller economies have used low national corporate tax rates to attract inward investment, including from tech giants.\n The US, meanwhile, has not been sitting on its hands as European governments move ahead to set their own platform taxes. The Trump administration has been throwing its weight around \u2014 arguing US companies are being unfairly targeted by the taxes and warning that it could  retaliate with up to 100% tariffs on countries that go ahead. Though it has yet to do so.\n On the digital tax reform issue the US has said it wants a multilateral agreement via the OECD on a  global minimum. And a\u00a0petite  entente cordiale was reached between France and the US  last summer when president Emmanuel Macron agreed the French tech tax would be scraped once the OECD came up with a global fix.\n However with Trump\u2019s negotiators pulling out of international tax talks with the EU the prospect of a global understanding on a very divisive issue looks further away than ever.\n Though the UK said today it remains committed to a global solution, per  Reuters which quotes a treasury spokesman.\n Earlier this month the US also launched a formal investigation into new or proposed digital taxes in the EU, including the UK\u2019s levy and the EU\u2019s proposal, and plans set out by a number of other EU countries, claiming they \u201cunfairly target\u201d U.S. tech companies

"note_en": "Another long night. I was working on my perfect, bug-free program in C, when the predictable thing happened:\n  Oh, well... Maybe I&#39;ll be more lucky taking over the world another night. But then it struck me. My program received a SIGSEGV signal and crashed with &#34;Segmentation Fault&#34; message. Where does the &#34;V&#34; come from?\n Did I read it wrong? Was there a &#34;Segmentation  Vault?&#34;? Or did Linux authors make a mistake? Shouldn&#39;t the signal be named SIGSEGF?\n I asked my colleagues and  David Wragg quickly told me that the signal name stands for &#34;Segmentation Violation&#34;. I guess that makes sense. Long long time ago, computers used to have  memory segmentation. Each memory segment had defined length - called Segment Limit. Accessing data over this limit caused a processor fault. This error code got re-used  by newer systems that used paging. I think the Intel manuals call this error  &#34;Invalid Page Fault&#34;. When it&#39;s triggered it gets reported to the userspace as a SIGSEGV signal. End of story.\n  Martin Levy pointed me to an ancient  Version 6th UNIX documentation on &#34;signal&#34;. This is from around 1978:\n   It seems that userspace parts of the UNIX tree (i.e. /usr/include/signal.h) switched to SIGSEGV fairly early on. But the kernel internals continued to use the name SIGSEG for much longer.\n Looking deeper David found that PDP11 trap vector used wording  &#34;segmentation violation&#34;. This shows up in Research V4 Edition in the UNIX history repo, but it doesn&#39;t mean it was introduced in V4 - it&#39;s just because V4 is the first version with code still available.\n  The file /usr/include/signal.h appears in the tree for Research V7,  with the name SIGSEGV. But the kernel  still called it SIGSEG at the time\n  Here you go. Originally the signal was called SIGSEG. It was subsequently renamed SIGSEGV in the userspace and a bit later - around 1980 - to SIGSEGV on the kernel side. Apparently there are still no Segmentation Vaults found on UNIX systems.\n As for my original crash, I fixed it - of course - by catching the signal and jumping over the offending instruction. On Linux it is totally possible to catch and handle SIGSEGV. With that fix, my code will never again crash. For sure.\n #define _GNU_SOURCE#include &lt;signal.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;ucontext.h&gt;static void sighandler(int signo, siginfo_t *si, void* v_context){ ucontext_t *context = v_context; context-&gt;uc_mcontext.gregs[REG_RIP] += 10;}int *totally_null_pointer = NULL;int main() { struct sigaction psa; psa.sa_sigaction = sighandler; sigaction(SIGSEGV, &amp;psa, NULL); printf(&#34;Before NULL pointer dereference\\n&#34;); *totally_null_pointer = 1; __asm__ __volatile__(&#34;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;nop;&#34;); printf(&#34;After NULL pointer.

"note_en": "Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson\u00a0launched a firestorm of public criticism of Apple after Apple rejected an update to Basecamp&#39;s new email app.\u00a0Hansson&#39;s  tweet thread and the ensuing controversy surfaced days before Apple&#39;s annual developer conference, and amidst news that the European Commission has opened an  antitrust probe of Apple and the App Store.\n The app in question is Hey, an email tool that eschews tradition to offer a better experience for a certain type of user. It requires users to pay a $99 annual subscription fee to access its features and services but offers a free trial period.\n Hey&#39;s 1.0 version was approved for launch on the App Store just this week, but it came under scrutiny at Apple when Basecamp attempted to deliver a 1.0.1 update with bug fixes. As events unfolded, a call and email came from Apple that indicated Hey would have to take steps toward making its subscription available through Apple&#39;s own billing system and in-app-payments platform. Otherwise, the app would be delisted from the store.\n According to Hansson, Apple told Basecamp that Hey violated rule 3.1.1 in the App Store&#39;s review guidelines.\u00a0Here&#39;s the language Apple uses  in those guidelines:\n If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, etc. Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.\n But at first glance, Hey doesn&#39;t break that rule.\u00a0It does not allow users to subscribe within the app. Instead, users must go to Hey&#39;s website to sign up through Basecamp&#39;s own billing\u2014as is the case for many other popular apps like Spotify or Netflix.\u00a0As per Apple&#39;s guidelines, Hey does not have a link or call-to-action directing users to said website.\n This was understandably a source of confusion for the Hey team. Also confusing: the fact that the 1.0.1 update was rejected but not the 1.0 version, even though the update did not change anything related to this issue.\n Though the tweet started the conversation, much of the meat is in a  follow-up article by David Pierce in Protocol, which contains or references statements from both Hansson and Apple. That report fleshes out the details; it appears Apple is also holding Hey to a set of rules that are\u00a0 not included in the public guidelines.\n  Apple told me that its actual mistake was approving the app in the first place, when it didn&#39;t conform to its guidelines. Apple allows these kinds of client apps\u2014where you can&#39;t sign up, only sign in\u2014for business services but not consumer products. That&#39;s why Basecamp, which companies typically pay for, is allowed on the App Store when Hey, which users pay for, isn&#39;t.\n  One other distinction: Apple allows \u201cReader\u201d apps\u2009\u2014\u2009things like Netflix and Kindle and Dropbox, where you\u2019re using the app to access existing subscriptions\u2009\u2014\u2009as long as they don\u2019t offer a way to sign up. But email, messaging, etc. don\u2019t count as Reader apps.\n Many members of the development community have responded to these revelations with outrage, because these distinctions are not stated or clarified in Apple&#39;s App Store review guidelines. Plus, there are numerous examples of apps that defy classification or simply don&#39;t seem to follow these rules, leaving commentators to  ask what the difference really is between say, Dropbox (which doesn&#39;t appear to have this problem) and Hey (which does).\n The outrage also stems from a strongly held and often voiced belief that Apple&#39;s 15 to 30 percent cut of subscriptions revenue gained through its payment system is not justified. For his part, Hansson made it clear Basecamp doesn&#39;t intend to just make the changes Apple has requested. Quoted in The Protocol, he says:\n There is never in a million years a way that I am paying Apple a third of our revenues.\u00a0That is obscene, and it&#39;s criminal, and I will spend every dollar that we have or ever make to burn this down until we get to somewhere better.\n Apple has not yet released any additional statements, but it seems this conflict is not yet over.\n  In his tweet thread, Hansson repeatedly compared Apple to the mob and gangsters, even though Apple has not yet been found to be breaking the law.\u00a0While various players like Spotify have opened complaints, those complaints haven&#39;t been resolved, and there have been no decisive conclusions that what Apple is doing is, in fact, illegal in Europe, the United States, or most other regions.\n It&#39;s difficult to make the case that Apple is a monopoly, because it does have competition, and it holds a minority market share\u2014by an enormous margin\u2014against its main competitor. But the winds of the legality question could shift, pending the results of the EU complaints and investigation.\n Developers have long complained about the &#34;Apple tax&#34;\u2014that revenue cut the company takes from apps in its App Store. To that point, Hansson is  quoted in The Verge comparing Apple&#39;s cut unfavorably with those of credit card companies that handle billing for transactions like this:\n Why is it that credit card processing fees hover in the 1.8-2.8% range, while Apple\u2019s App Store have sat steady at 30% on the high end? Because there\u2019s no competition! And they have a monopoly grip!\n Credit cards, he argues, offer such low fees because they live in a world of fierce competition\u2014never mind the fact that credit cards are largely fungible. And there are more reasons for this difference besides competition. Credit card companies do not offer nearly the breadth of services and support to businesses that Apple does.\u00a0It&#39;s not just about payment infrastructure.\n Apple provides resources and support to developers, including a wide range of APIs and software tools, that are critical to developing iOS and iPadOS apps. It is not possible to create the apps without them. Apple operates a vast editorial operation to curate and highlight apps, which many developers I have spoken with say is vital for discoverability and success on the platform.\u00a0Apple spends a fortune on the research and development of hardware that developers use, like cameras, CPUs, machine-learning processors, GPUs, and more. And yes, it operates a payments system.\n Apple&#39;s defense of its revenue share, when it has offered one, is similar to the defense of corporate taxes by a national government, which most people support: the earnings of a business are only possible because of the government&#39;s support and diligence in providing security, regulations, multiple forms of basic infrastructure, and so on, so it is reasonable for that business to pay a significant sum in taxes.\n That&#39;s what Apple offers to developers. It&#39;s also worth considering the investment that went into the platform to begin with.", "posttime": "2020-06-18 20:28:48", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u82f9\u679c,app,apple,\u5e94\u7528", "title": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e00\u6b3e\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u82f9\u679c\u5f00\u6218-\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e24\u6b3e\u90fd\u4e0d\u5bf9", "title_en": "Why one email app went to war with Apple\u2013and why neither one is right", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/why-one-email-app-went-to-war-with-apple-and-why-neither-one-is-right/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u82f9\u679c", "app", "apple", "\u5e94\u7528"]}]
