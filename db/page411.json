"note_en": "Sian-Pierre Regis, 35, is used to living with roommates. For the past 10 years, he has split the rent on his apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan with two (in some cases, three) friends. But in June, he\u2019s getting a co-tenant of a different sort: his 78-year-old mother, Rebecca Danigelis.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think either of us expected to be in this situation,\u201d said Mr. Regis, a freelance filmmaker. His mother worked for over 40 years as a hotel housekeeper, rising to a management position, until her job was abruptly eliminated three years ago.\n Since then, she has lived off her slim retirement savings (she liquidated most of her 401(k) to pay Mr. Regis\u2019s college tuition in 2002) and whatever part-time cleaning jobs she could find. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, she again was out of work, and at the end of May, the lease on her subsidized housing in Boston will expire. She can\u2019t afford the rent.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what she could have done better, or how she could have prevented this,\u201d Mr. Regis said. \u201cShe worked long hours, never called in sick and cleaned houses to make extra money when she wasn\u2019t at her hotel job. She had no vices.\u201d\n Still, as a single parent raising two children, she struggled to save. \u201cWhen she lost her job, she had $600 in her savings account,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had nothing to fall back on.\u201d\n Nothing except her son, that is. Which makes Mr. Regis one of the growing number of millennials who are supporting their parents financially and, in some cases, giving them a place to live. Known as the reverse-boomerang effect, the phenomenon of parents moving in with their adult children, often for financial reasons, is on the rise. According to a  Pew Research Center analysis of population data, 14 percent of adults living in someone else \u2019s home in 2017 were a parent of the head of household,  ...\n Expressed in starker terms, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has  predicted that half of today\u2019s workers will not have enough savings to sustain their standard of living when they retire. According to the AARP Public Policy Institute,  one in five Americans will be over the age of 65 by 2030 (compared with  one in seven in 2017), \u201cand our nation will face a severe shortage in accessible and affordable housing to meet their needs.\u201d\n  Enter the resurgence of multigenerational housing, when adults from at least two generations share the same home. After declining to its lowest point in 1980, multigenerational housing is now close to its 1950 peak, representing 20 percent of the total American population in 2016,  according to another Pew analysis.\n While that trend is largely driven by 20-somethings living with their middle-aged parents,  Pew researchers found that older adults were also significantly more likely to be living with their grown children in recent years than they were in the 1990s.\n Younger Americans should take this pattern seriously, says Georgia Lee Hussey, a financial planner in Portland, Ore., who has clients across the country. \u201cMost of my clients have at least one parent that needs to be factored into their financial plan,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s tricky is that for some families, it can be unexpected. Especially in white American culture, people over 60 are often uncomfortable talking about their finances, and ashamed to ask their children for help.\u201d\n And don\u2019t underestimate the power of denial. Ms. Hussey noted that many baby boomers watched their own parents enjoy an era of heartier pension plans and lower health care costs. Now, many Americans work hard all their lives but still don\u2019t have enough savings to retire. \u201cThen, suddenly their child realizes, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have to take care of dad,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt can lead to some incredibly difficult conversations.\u201d\n  For Dulcinea Myers-Newcomb, 45, that realization happened when her 80-year-old father came to visit her and her two children, ages 8 and 14, in Portland \u2014 and then never left. \u201cHe said, \u2018So, I\u2019m not really visiting. I live here now,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that my father did not ever plan for this phase in his life, but my husband and I were not prepared for him to move in as soon as he did.\u201d\n To make room for their new housemate, Ms. Myers-Newcomb, a real-estate agent, arranged to install what is known as an accessory dwelling unit \u2014a secondary apartment built on a single-family residential lot \u2014in their small backyard. But the price \u2014about $110,000 \u2014put the family in a tight spot. Like many Americans, she and her husband were already sandwiched between lingering student debt and trying to save for their own retirement. They took out a home equity line of credit to cover the  ...\n \u201cI hope my kids don\u2019t have to do this for me someday, but I think it\u2019s beautiful that our children see that we\u2019re taking care of our elders,\u201d Ms. Myers-Newcomb said. \u201cI\u2019m seeing it more and more in my work, too: people my age and younger taking in their parents.\u201d\n \u201cMy parents were pretty explicit that my siblings and I were their retirement plan,\u201d said Ka Po Lam, a 28-year-old treasury analyst who works for a bank in New York City. His family moved to the United States when he was a young boy, and he started giving half his take-home pay to his father at age 15, when he got his first job at McDonald\u2019s.\n \u201cBeing from Hong Kong, it\u2019s part of our culture to help the family,\u201d he said. \u201cAs immigrants, both my parents worked manual labor jobs. They don\u2019t get Social Security. The traditional ways to afford retirement aren\u2019t really available to them.\u201d\n  Mr. Lam now sends about $800 a month to his parents, who live with his older sister in Boston. \u201cI \u2019m basically paying double rent \u2014mine and my parents \u2019\u2014so I manage money pretty carefully, \u201dhe said. For a while, he had a second job at a coffee shop to earn extra cash on weekends \u2014a different lifestyle from most of his banker colleagues \u2019, but he \u2019s not complaining. \u201cIt \u2019s not something I hide, \u201dhe said. \u201cAs much of a burden as that can be, I find validation in the fact that I can  ...\n Still, financial responsibility for aging parents can be daunting no matter how much planning you do, said Athena Valentine Lent, 34, a program manager for a nonprofit in Phoenix, Ariz. \u201cI\u2019m Latina, and multigenerational households are normal in our culture,\u201d she said. \u201cI always knew my dad would come to live with me someday, and I\u2019ve worked hard to prepare, but it\u2019s still not easy.\u201d\n Although her father is only 53, she expects that a combination of his health and financial issues will put him on her doorstep within the next five years. \u201cI have a \u2018dad fund, \u2019and I put a couple hundred dollars a month in it, \u201dshe said. \u201cIt affects a lot of my life decisions. If my partner and I decide to buy a house, it will have to be big enough for my dad to live there with us. It \u2019s a lot to think about, especially since I \u2019d like to have children of my own in the next couple  ...\n To make matters more complicated, her father takes care of his mother, Ms. Lent\u2019s grandmother. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t just be taking care of him. I would also take in my grandma, and possibly my aunt too, because she also lives with them,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t just inherit our parents \u2014 we inherit entire families.\u201d\n These early reverse-boomerang pioneers are laying important groundwork, said Rodney Harrell, the vice president of family, home, and community at the AARP. \u201cAs it becomes more normalized for older adults to live with their grown children, I think it will get easier for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your neighbor builds an accessory dwelling unit, or has their parents living with them, you might realize it\u2019s a viable option for you and your family, too.\u201d\n That\u2019s certainly been the case for Mr. Regis. \u201cAt first, I felt really lost. My situation was foreign to my closest friends, the people I\u2019d gone to college with,\u201d he said. But when he made a documentary film about his mother\u2019s experience, \u201cDuty Free,\u201d the response was huge. \u201cWhen we released the trailer for the film, I heard from so many people, my own age and younger, who said, \u2018Thank you for making this. My mom just moved in with me, too, and I would do anything for her.\u2019\u201d\n He also sees a silver lining. \u201cIn our country, the elderly become invisible.

"note_en": "Our team,  DeisLabs, recently released a new piece of software called  Krustlet, which is a tool for running  WebAssembly modules on the popular, open-source container management tool called  Kubernetes. Kubernetes is used quite extensively to run cloud software across many vendors and companies and is primarily written in the  Go programming language. While there have been many stories about using Rust for systems level programming, you don\u2019t often hear stories about cloud software  orKubernetes software  ...\n  First off, let \u2019s start with some important context. WebAssembly (abbreviated as WASM) was originally designed to be run in browsers. WASM is a compiled binary that can be downloaded and run in any browser. This allows for performant applications to be run inside of a browser and is currently used in many major web applications. Recent work has enabled compiled WASM binaries (called modules) to be run on any system. Rust is one of the few languages with native build support for these binaries.  ...\n  The other reason we chose Rust was its strong safety and security guarantees. Like most Rust newbies, we started off cursing Rust \u2019s borrow checker (which statically enforces many of Rust \u2019s safety guarantees) and sometimes fighting with it for hours. But after we started to get a better understanding of how to code things, we realized how many bugs and problems the compiler was saving us from. It kept us from exposing possible null pointers, thread safety issues, and other overlooked bugs.  ...\n A concrete example of this is how the Rust compiler protected us from various concurrency bugs. Krustlet is responsible for running arbitrary numbers of WASM modules in parallel. As we wrote the code for managing the running modules, the borrow checker caught cases of us passing a data structure between threads that would have resulted in unsafe or concurrent data access problems. It also prevented us from using objects that could have already been accessed by previous parts of the code.\n Even though we sometimes miss having a garbage collector so we don\u2019t have to worry about cloning, borrowing, ownership, etc., the pain we have avoided because of the Rust compiler\u2019s strict rules is incalculable. For comparison, last week  we caught a significant race condition in another Kubernetes-related project we maintain called  Helm(written in Go) that has been there for a year or more, and which passed the race checker for Go. That error would never have escaped the Rust compiler, preventing  ...\n Because of the large amount of customization (at least in Kubernetes) with custom data types and the distributed nature of cloud computing, having these protections and safety guarantees at the compiler level gives us great confidence in the code we are writing. By no means does it eliminate all bugs, but it does help us avoid many of the common concurrency ones from the beginning. In addition, having a strong type system that still allows for extensibility (in the form of  traits, which the  ...\n In short, the flexibility, safety, and security of Rust outweighs any inconvenience of having to follow strict lifetime, borrowing, and other compiler rules or even the lack of a garbage collector. These features are a much-needed addition to cloud software projects and will help avoid many bugs commonly found in them.\n  Just because we love many things about Rust doesn\u2019t mean everything is rosy. We also learned of a few gotchas that we consider important to point out as you make the decision of whether to use Rust for a new cloud software project.\n One of the biggest ones to point out is that async runtimes are still a bit unclear. There are currently two different options to choose from, each of them with their own tradeoffs and problems. Also, many of the implementation details are tied to specific runtimes, meaning that if you have a dependency that uses one runtime over another, you \u2019ll often be locked into that runtime choice. Rust has made great progress in the past year with its async story, but there are still some issues  ...\n The other thing to watch out for is the learning curve. It takes several weeks of hard effort learning how to code properly in Rust before the learning curve levels out. However, that hard effort up front pays off in dividends due to the aforementioned safety features. We also noticed that once developers are over that initial curve, they are able to contribute to code just as easily as with any other language. Just be aware that there will be some initial pain.\n If you are willing to deal with these current problems, then there is no reason why you shouldn\u2019t at least consider using Rust for your next project. All languages have their tradeoffs, but we feel the benefits gained outweigh any of these pain points.\n  We see a bright future for Rust in cloud software. In the immediate future, we plan on continuing its use for any of our projects where it would be a good fit. Given the features Rust brings to the table, even with its lack of some familiar features (such as garbage collection), we highly recommend it as an option for your next cloud software project.",

coronavirus, according to a report on Wednesday.\n Dean Banks, president of Tyson Foods, said the company is working with Matrix Medical, a clinical services company, that will ensure coronavirus is not spreading in plants where it has been detected.\n &#34;That gives us the team that we need to come in and make sure that\u00a0we put food on the American table,&#34; Banks said on &#34;Fox &amp; Friends&#34; Friday morning.\n The Tyson plant\u00a0located in Logansport, Ind., has seen 890 of\u00a0its 2,200\u00a0employees test positive in just under a week -- more than 40 percent of its workforce. It&#39;s one of several Tyson plants across the country that have voluntarily closed due to virus outbreaks.\n  Cass County\u00a0officials have been working with Tyson, the largest U.S. meat supplier, in developing a plan to reopen,\u00a0according to Indianapolis&#39;s WISH-TV.\n   Cass County Commissioner Ryan Browning said that plan has been expedited after\u00a0President Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday, ensuring meat processing plants would stay open during the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic.\n The businesses are now declared as\u00a0\u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d\u00a0under the Defense Production Act.\n \u201cSo there is some worry there that might force them to flip a switch and go but we are continuing with our plan,\u201d Browning told the station.\n  Pork processing\u00a0offers workers little personal space, who typically work in a close-quarter environment, WISH-TV reported. The virus is known to spread from person-to-person\u00a0within six-feet, through respiratory droplets in the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n   \u201cWe\u2019ve been screening worker temperatures, requiring protective face coverings and conducting additional cleaning and sanitizing. We\u2019ve also implemented social distancing measures, such as workstation dividers and more breakroom space,&#34; it said, according to the  station.\n Health officials reported 1,283 coronavirus cases in the county as of Tuesday. The peak number of cases is expected to hit in the next two weeks.\n  Indiana has seen more than\u00a017,835 coronavirus cases and at least\u00a01,114 deaths from the virus, as of early Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 06:55:09", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u5de5\u5382,tyson", "title": "\u5370\u7b2c\u5b89\u7eb3\u5dde\u6cf0\u68ee\u98df\u54c1\u5de5\u5382\u8fd1900\u540d\u5de5\u4eba\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u68c0\u6d4b\u5448\u9633\u6027", "title_en": "Nearly 900 workers at Tyson Foods plant in Indiana test positive for coronavirus", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/nearly-900-tyson-foods-plant-indiana-test-positive-coronavirus", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u5de5\u5382", "tyson"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c2275ef7b92e4ddb8189c34292a6004e.png", "infoid": 1000425, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u5199\u4ea7\u54c1\u9700\u6c42\u6587\u6863(PRD)\uff0c\u6211\u627f\u8ba4\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4ece\u54ea\u91cc\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\u4f46\u6211\u77e5\u9053\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\uff1a\u6211\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u5bf9\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u4efd\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6027\u6587\u4ef6\u6301\u6000\u7591\u6001\u5ea6\u3002\n\u5728\u6211\u56de\u5230\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u9662\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u654f\u6377\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u8425\u9500\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u7ecf\u7406\u3002\u6211\u88ab\u704c\u8f93\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u522b\u7684Scrum\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u5ea6\u7684\u793c\u4eea\u3002\u6362\u53e5\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ee5\u6587\u6863\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u6d41\u7a0b\u7e41\u91cd\u3001\u4eea\u5f0f\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u82b1\u8d39\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7cbe\u529b\u3002\u53ea\u8bb0\u5f55\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u7b80\u5316\u6216\u6d88\u9664\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u53bb\u6389\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7e41\u6587\u7f1b\u8282\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u5199\u4e00\u4efd\u5bc6\u5bc6\u9ebb\u9ebb\u7684\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u91cd\u7533\u539f\u578b\u5df2\u7ecf\u5c55\u793a\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5417\uff1f\u55ef\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u5427\u3002\u4f46\u6211\u5b66\u5230\u4e86\u4e24\u4ef6\u4e8b\u3002\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u5ea6\u7684\u4eea\u5f0f\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6c38\u8fdc\u6ca1\u6709\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u5f53\u8c08\u5230\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u54c1\u65f6\uff0c\u786e\u5b9e\u9700\u8981\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u7406\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u7559\u4e0b\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u4f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u3002\n\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u540d\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728UX\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\uff0c\u6211\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u5728\u53ef\u70b9\u51fb\u539f\u578b\u4e2d\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u663e\u800c\u6613\u89c1\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u67d0\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u3002\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6211\u6b63\u5728\u5c3d\u6211\u6700\u5927\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u5728PRD\u4e2d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u8ba9\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\uff0c\u4f46\u53c8\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8d8a\u754c\u8fdb\u5165\u81c3\u80bf\u7684\u6587\u6863\u3002\u795d\u6211\u597d\u8fd0\uff01\n\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u8d44\u6e90\uff1a\n\u672c\u6307\u5357\u6df1\u5165\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u521b\u5efa\u9002\u5408\u654f\u6377\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u76caPRD\u3002\u5b83\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86PRD\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6210\u5206\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u7b80\u77ed\u548c\u751c\u871c\u3002(\u7ecf\u7531\u4e9a\u7279\u5170\u897f\u4e9a\u5c9b)", "note_en": "I\u2019m writing a product requirement document (PRD) for the first time, and I\u2019ll admit, I didn\u2019t know quite where to start. But I did know one thing: I knew that I was skeptical of such a time-intensive, technical document.\n Before I came back to grad school, I was a project manager on a marketing team using agile methodologies. I was indoctrinated into one scrum principle in particular:  Employ minimally sufficient ceremony. In other words, document-centric, process-heavy, high-ceremony approaches cost time and effort. Only document what you need to document. Simplify or eliminate processes whenever possible. Get rid of unnecessary formality.\n Yet here I am, tasked with writing a dense document that\u2019s just there to reiterate what the prototype already demonstrates, right? Well, maybe. But I\u2019ve learned two things.\n First,  minimally sufficient ceremony doesn\u2019t mean  no documentation ever, and when it comes to building a product, there does need to one source of truth that leaves little open to interpretation.\n Second, as the product designer who\u2019s been working on UX for months now, I forget what\u2019s obvious in the clickable prototype vs. what\u2019s still on a sketch somewhere, particularly when it comes to interaction design and content strategy.\n So, with that in mind, I\u2019m trying my best to translate the design in a PRD with just enough detail that the developer gets it, but without slipping over the line into bloated documentation. Wish me luck!\n In the mean time, here are a handful of resources that I\u2019ve found helpful:\n  This guide gives insight into how to make a lean PRD that fits into an agile approach. It walks through types of components usually found in PRDs and how to keep it all short and sweet.

"note_en": "I have a burning desire to become the best version of myself, to unlock my full human potential.\n In the past four months, I studied the subconsious mind. Not only theoretically, but putting what I learned into practice.\n While I believe that I have only scrached the surface, here are some of my results:\n    Most people are self-limiting. We can do way more than we believe. Even worse, most of us underrate ourselves; we shortchange ourselves, and sell ourselves short. The result is that most people suffer from feelings of inferiority.\n The goal is to \u201cget more living out of life\u201d. To become the best version we can be. It\u2019s our duty to use the talents and potential that we have.\n 95% of our behavior, feeling, and response is habitual and automatic. These automatic mechanisms play themselves out in the subconscious mind.\n   Feed this mechanism with thoughs of failure and past mistakes, and it will act as a failure mechanism.\n Feed this mechanism with optimism and a worthwhile goal, and it will act as a success mechanism.\n The sad thing is that most people are constantly reliving their failures and bad memories. They block and sabotage themselves.\n   When using the subconscious mind, we are in effect harnessing the placebo effect. Patients receiving a placebo believe they are receiving legitimate medicine. The key word is \u201cbelieve\u201d. We can use the same effect to cure illnesses and bring success to our lives.\n Our brain and nervous system cannot tell the difference between a real experience, and one that is vividly imagined.\n  We need to develop the habit of reliving past successes. Connect with \u201cthat winning feeling\u201d. And use this to \u201cprime\u201d ourselves for success.\n How can we succeed if we constantly remember our past failures and bad moments? It creates a negative spiral.\n What we want is a positive spiral. When you remember your past successes, it leads to self-confidence and optimism. This energy can then be used as fuel to create more success in the present moment.\n You need to \u201cstart with the end in mind\u201d. Picture the end result, as vividly as possible. If you are a musician, picture a finished song, picture standing on stage, performing your work. If you are an autor, picture the finished book, people reading it, telling you how much they liked it. Add details and feelings. Be proud of your work. Imagine people being happy and touched by your work.\n Relaxation is more important than willpower. Willpower leads to tension, which blocks your success mechanism. Just relax and let your automatic mechanism do the work.\n Your work is to imagine, to feel, and to feed the goal to your subconscious mind. Then relax and let your subconscious mind guide you. That\u2019s how \u201cgetting ideas in the shower\u201d works. You relax. You let things flow. And whatever you need to do comes automatically. No willpower needed.\n We need to maintain a positive aggressive goal-striving attitude. Attack challenges with massive action. Do this in reality as well as in imagination. Imagine yourself overcoming all challenges. Never fall back to a passive, defensive, victim-like attitude.\n  The failure-type personality does not direct his energy and emotional steam toward a worthwile goal. Instead, this person complains, drowns in self-pity or \u201cswallows\u201d his frustration, leading to illness and unhappiness.\n Work remains one of the best therapies, and one of the best tranquilizers for a troubled spirit.\n A human is like a bicycle. It maintains it\u2019s poise and equilibrium only so long as it is going forward toward something.\n Our disturbed feelings are caused not by externals, but by our own responses. We need to learn how to ignore, delay or change these responses.\n Mistakes are good. Without them, learning is impossible. But, mistakes are only a means to an end. Once we succeed, we should forget the mistakes. We should only remember the successful attempt.\n When your automatic mechanism is \u201cset for success\u201d we experience \u201cthat winning feeling\u201d.\n Develop a nostalgia for the future instead of for the past. Have something to look forward to. Don\u2019t live in the past. That\u2019s what old people do.\n Gradualness is important. We need to arrange things so that we can succeed in little things, and then gradually build up. Like weight lifters and boxers do. Success is build upon success. If you start with something too difficult, you will never have the momentum to continue.\n We are responsible for our own life. The past explains how we got here. But where we go from here is our responsibility. Blaming others and complaining does not improve our life. Accept where you came from, and do the best with what you have.\n As the placebo effect shows, the body is capable of healing itself. In fact, all healing is self-healing. \u201cThe surgeon dresses the wound, God heals it.\u201d\n We need to cultivate an \u201cinner smile\u201d. The best way is to imagine a goal, and feel good about having it. If you don\u2019t feel good about something, it won\u2019t work. Feelings are always stronger than thoughts. Your feelings and thoughts need to be in sync. If you imagine a goal but feel anxiety or frustration, the anxiety and frustration will win.\n Not even willpower can overcome feelings. You can expend as much willpower as you want, if you don\u2019t feel good about something, you won\u2019t achieve it.\n  Reserve judgement for 21 days, because it requires a minimum of 21 days to effect any perceptible change in a mental image or habit.\n The goal is to develop new habits, new automatic patters. Which means that daily practice is key. Even if it\u2019s just 5 minutes.\n  Practice the Cou\u00e9 method \u201eDay by day, in every way, I am getting better and better.\u201c (Repeat 20 times in a low, hearable voice)\n Tell yourself that you\u2019ll be having a great day today. You will feel good. You will be successful. The more emotion you use, the better.\n  Cou\u00e9 method: If you have physical or emotional pain, put your hand on the hurting spot or your head (emotional pain), then relax and repeat 20 times \u201cIt passes. It passes. It passes\u201d\n  Theatre of the mind When you begin, scan your body for tension and relax your head, torso, waist, legs, and so on\n  Then go into the future and picture how you want to be with the same feeling you felt in the past\n   How to be calmer Build an imaginary quiet room in your mind and retire to it regularly (your personal decompression chamber)\n Deliberate practice Practice whatever you want to improve in a realistic way (social situations, giving talks etc.)\n How to cure worry \u201cWhat is the worst that can possibly happen?\u201d and realize that it probably won\u2019t be so bad.\n Practice positive mental imagery, immediately and \u201con cue\u201d, whenever you become aware of negative feelings.\n How to change habits The best way to break a habit is to form a clear mental image of the desired end result, and to practice without effort toward reaching that goal\n Challenge your beliefs Don\u2019t just pass these questions by casually. Wrestle with them. Think hard on them. Get emotional about them.\n Can you see that you have cheated yourself and sold yourself short, not because of a \u201cfact\u201d, but only because some stupid belief?\n Whenever you are angry on someone, write a letter to the person. Pull out all the stops. Leave nothing to the imagination. Then burn the letter.\n  How to be calm Create in your imagination a vivid mental picture of yourself sitting quietly, composed, unmoved, \u201cletting the telephone ring\u201d\n Say to yourself, \u201cI am letting the telephone ring\u201d, whenever you are tempted to \u201cobey\u201d or respond to some fear-bell or anxiety-bell\n  See yourself in various situations that have in the past upset you, only now you remain \u201cset\u201d, settled, poised, by not responding.\n  \u201cSleep on it\u201d: Sometimes the best thing is to take a nap or sleep on something\n Clear your mechanism before undertaking a new task (go to your quiet room between tasks)\n See negative feelings as challenges Reframe negative situations into something positive: make an effort to find the positive in a situation\n Change your memories Change past failures, modify the memories, like you modify a tape recording by adding material or replacing a recording\n Play with your memories. You don\u2019t have to be a slave to them. Do with them whatever you want. Change them. Ignore them. Delete them.\n Act and feel young People get old when they stop moving, when they get stuck, when they stop going forward\n Live in day-tight compartments \u201cWhen I fall asleep I die. When I wake up I start a new life\u201d\n  Go through your day and change all negative situations into positive ones. Imagine you acted and reacted perfectly.\n Practice the Cou\u00e9 method \u201eDay by day, in every way, I am getting better and better.\u201c (Repeat 20 times in a low, hearable voice)\n Tell yourself that you will fall asleep easily. And that you will wake up fully refreshed.\n If you have children, you can make suggestions to them while they sleep (without waking them up), and also practice with them while they are awake.",

"note_en": "From fitness bracelets to glucose monitoring, modern technology has made it possible for people to quickly, accurately and effectively keep track of their own health condition. And what\u2019s good for humans is often also good for our furry friends.\n The booming global pet care market is projected to grow to US$280 billion by 2025. In recent years, AI techniques and IoT technologies have enabled big-data-based smart vet projects and innovative pet care products such as smart collars and smart feeding and watering systems that can be customized using machine learning algorithms. These frontier technologies are also helping owners provide their pets with healthier and longer lives.\n  Cat kidney disease is a nightmare for pet owners. While most cat kidney disease develops with age, chronic cat kidney disease happens randomly, has no cure, and is the number one cause of death for cats over five years old.  Mars Petcare, a Belgian company founded in 1937, has developed an artificial intelligence powered tool called RenalTech for early diagnosis of chronic cat kidney disease. The RenalTech system analyzes pet patient data including creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, white blood cell  ...\n  While chronic diseases are a diagnosis and treatment focus, pet owners also naturally worry about the general health condition of their pets. Moreover, maintaining a healthy life can help protect pets from other illnesses. Founded in 2018, UK-based startup Vet-AI is working on an innovative technology platform that can predict medical conditions in pets before they develop into serious problems. Vet-AI uses a Bayesian network to mimic the way a veterinarian thinks and calculate the probability  ...\n The ultimate goal for this tech is not to replace vets but to give them a tool that can help with early diagnosis. The company has already launched the first stage of its Vet-AI project, an app called Joii, which can provide comprehensive symptom check-ups for animal ailments.\n  Another topic that is attracting more and more attention is pet longevity. PetSensus, founded in Latvia in 2018, has developed a biomedical data platform using big data techniques. The platform collects data from pet owners and uses a homegrown machine learning model to generate a personalized pet care guide. Petsensus recently entered into a partnership with Insilico Medicine to find ways to extend pet longevity.

It may seem like a trivial topic of discussion but as the saying goes:\n There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. - Phil Karlton\n The aforementioned blogpost outlines conventions on how feature branches could be named; prepending with an ID from an issue tracker and using hyphens as separators for a short description of the feature the branch addresses. For example:\n  This would work, but in the real-world, feature branches rarely address such a large item as &#34;billing module&#34;. While developing, we typically work on smaller subtasks of such a feature. Ideally, of course, each subtask would have issue tracker IDs but they often don&#39;t. Branches related to the same feature would typically look like this:\n  Given that this is the case, both  GitHub and  GitLab have adopted referencing the issue in the commit instead as the solution for connecting to the issue tracker.\n The naming of feature branches then, depends on their purpose: they should be short-lived, task-oriented and, deleted when they&#39;re merged. Their purpose is agility.\n While I agree with the kebab-casing of branch names, as developers we should remain free to name our branches as we see fit. Feature branches should stay lightweight and should  not be used to create yet another process.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 05:48:45", "tags": "\u5206\u652f,branch,branches", "title": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684Git\u5206\u652f\u547d\u540d\u7ea6\u5b9a", "title_en": "Git Branch Naming Conventions for the Real World", "transed": 1, "url": "https://blog.kowsheek.com/git-branch-naming-conventions-for-the-real-world/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u5206\u652f", "branch", "branches"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000419, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Juliusz Chroboczek JCH at iif.fr Fri May 1 12\uff1a15\uff1a56 BST 2020\u55e8\uff0c\u5f88\u62b1\u6b49\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u7bc7\u79bb\u9898\u7684\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u6ee5\u7528\u4e86\u8fd9\u4efd\u5217\u8868\u3002\u4f60\u4eec\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u8bb0\u5f97\u51e0\u5468\u524d\u6211\u5e7f\u544a\u8fc7\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9WebRTC\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u6211\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u8c08\u8bdd\u65b9\u5f0f(\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u5f88\u597d)\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u4e3a\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6628\u5929\u521a\u521a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u670912\u4eba\u53c2\u52a0\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae(12\u4eba\u8fdb\u6765\uff0c132\u4eba\u6d41\u51fa)\uff0c\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e3e\u884c\u4e86\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u60f3..\u3002", "note_en": "Juliusz Chroboczek  jch at irif.fr    Fri May 1 12:15:56 BST 2020  Hi, and sorry for abusing this list for another off-topic post.Some of you may remember the peer-to-peer WebRTC server I advertised a fewweeks ago.

"note_en": "Apple and Google are undertaking an   unprecedented team effort  to build a system for Androids and iPhones to interoperate in the name of technology-assisted COVID-19 contact tracing.\n The companies\u2019 plan is part of a torrent of proposals to use Bluetooth signal strength to   enhance manual contact tracing with  proximity-based mobile apps . As Apple and Google are an effective duopoly in the mobile operating system space, their plan carries special weight. Apple and Google \u2019s tech would be largely decentralized, keeping most of the data on users \u2019phones and away from central databases. This kind of app has some unavoidable privacy tradeoffs, as we \u2019ll discuss below, and  ...\n Proximity tracking apps might be, at most, a small part of a larger public health response to COVID-19. This use of Bluetooth technology is unproven and untested, and it\u2019s designed for use in smartphone apps that   won\u2019t reach everyone . The apps built on top of Apple and Google \u2019s new system will not be a \u201cmagic bullet \u201dtechnosolution to the current state of shelter-in-place. Their effectiveness will rely on numerous tradeoffs and sufficient trust for widespread public adoption. Insufficient  ...\n  As soon as today , Apple and Google are beginning to roll out parts of the iPhone and Android infrastructure that developers need to be able to build Bluetooth-based proximity tracking apps. If you download one of these apps, it will use your phone \u2019s Bluetooth chip to do what Bluetooth does: emit little radio pings to find other devices. Usually, these pings are looking for your external speakers or wireless mouse. In the case of COVID-19 proximity tracking apps, they will be reaching  ...\n There are now   many   different   proposals   to do basically   this same thing , with slightly different considerations for efficiency, security, and privacy. The rest of this post looks at Apple and Google\u2019s proposal (  version 1.1 ) in particular.\n Each phone will generate a new special-purpose private key each day, known as a \u201ctemporary exposure key.\u201d It will then use that key to generate random identification numbers called \u201crolling proximity identifiers\u201d (RPIDs). Pings will go out at least once every five minutes when Bluetooth is enabled. Each ping will contain the phone\u2019s current RPID, which will change every 10 to 20 minutes. This is meant to reduce the risk that third-party trackers can use the pings to   passively track  ...\n  If an app user learns they are infected, they can grant a public health authority permission to publicly share their temporary exposure keys. In order to prevent people from flooding the system with false alarms, health authorities need to verify that the user is actually infected before they may upload their keys. After they are uploaded, a user \u2019s temporary exposure keys are known as \u201cdiagnosis keys. \u201dThe diagnosis keys are stored in a public registry and available to everyone else  ...\n The diagnosis keys contain all the information needed to re-generate the full set of RPIDs associated with each infected user\u2019s device. Participating apps can use the registry to compare the RPIDs a user has been in contact with against the RPIDs of confirmed COVID-19 carriers. If the app finds a match, the user gets a notification of their risk of infection.\n The program will roll out in two phases. In phase 1, Google and Apple are building a new API into their respective platforms. This API will contain the bare-bones functionality necessary to make their proximity-tracing scheme work on both iPhones and Androids. Other developers will have to build apps that actually execute the new API. Draft specifications for the API have   already been published , and it could be available for developers to use   this week . In phase 2, the companies  ...\n  Several technical and social challenges stand in the way of automated proximity tracking. First, these apps assume that \u201ccell phone = human.\u201d But even in the U.S., cell phone adoption is   far from universal . Elderly people and low-income households are less likely to own smartphones, which could leave out many people at the highest risk for COVID-19. Many older phones   won\u2019t have the technology necessary for Bluetooth proximity tracking. Phones can be turned off, left at home, run  ...\n  Second, proximity tracking apps have to make the profound leap from \u201cthere is a strong Bluetooth signal near me \u201dto \u201ctwo humans are experiencing an epidemiologically relevant contact. \u201dBluetooth technology was not made for this. An app may log a connection when two people wearing masks briefly pass each other on a windy sidewalk, or when two cars with windows up sit next to each other in traffic. The proximity of a patient to a nurse in full PPE may look the same to Bluetooth  ...\n Third, Apple and Google\u2019s proposal currently specifies that phones will broadcast signals as seldom as once every five minutes. So even under otherwise optimal conditions, two phones may not log a contact until they\u2019ve been near each other for the requisite amount of time.\n Fourth, a significant portion of the population must actually use the apps. In Singapore, a government-developed app has only achieved about   20% adoption  after several weeks. As a mobile platform duopoly, Apple and Google are in perhaps the best position possible to encourage the deployment of a new piece of software at scale. Even so, adoption may be slow, and it   will never   be universal .\n  The truth is, nobody really knows how effective proximity tracking apps will be. Further, we need to weigh the potential benefits against the very real risks to privacy and security.\n First, any proximity tracking system that checks a public database of diagnosis keys against RPIDs on a user \u2019s device \u2014as the Apple-Google proposal does \u2014leaves open the possibility that the contacts of an infected person will figure out which of the people they encountered is infected. For example, if you have a contact with a friend, and your friend reports that they are infected, you could use your own device \u2019s contact log to learn that they are sick. Taken to an extreme,  ...\n Second, Apple and Google\u2019s choice to have infected users publicly share their once-per-day diagnosis keys\u2014instead of just their every-few-minute RPIDs\u2014exposes those people to   linkage attacks . A well-resourced adversary could collect RPIDs from many different places at once by setting up static Bluetooth beacons in public places, or by convincing thousands of users to install an app. The tracker will receive a firehose of RPIDs at different times and places. With just the  ...\n  But once a user uploads their daily diagnosis keys to the public registry, the tracker can use them to link together all of that person\u2019s RPIDs from a single day.\n  This can create a map of the user \u2019s daily routine, including where they work, live, and spend time. Such maps are highly unique to each person, so they could be used to identify the person behind the uploaded diagnosis key. Furthermore, they can reveal a person \u2019s home address, place of employment, and trips to sensitive locations like a church, an abortion clinic, a gay bar, or a substance abuse support group. The risk of location tracking is not unique to Bluetooth apps,  ...\n This risk can be mitigated by shortening the time that a single diagnosis key is used to generate RPIDs, at the cost of increasing the download size of the exposure database. Similar projects, like MIT\u2019s   PACT , propose using hourly keys instead of daily keys.\n Third, police may seek data created by proximity apps. Each user \u2019s phone will store a log of their physical proximity to the phones of other people, and thus of their intimate and expressive associations with some of those people, for several weeks. Anyone who has access to the proximity app data from two users \u2019phones will be able to see whether, and on what days, they have logged contacts with each other. This risk is likely inherent to any proximity tracking protocol.  ...\n Apple and Google \u2019s protocol may be susceptible to other kinds of attacks. For example, there \u2019s currently no way to verify that the device sending an RPID is actually the one that generated it, so trolls could collect RPIDs from others and rebroadcast them as their own. Imagine a network of Bluetooth beacons set up on busy street corners that rebroadcast all the RPIDs they observe. Anyone who passes by a \u201cbad \u201dbeacon would log the RPIDs of everyone else who was near  ...\n  Apple and Google \u2019s phase 1 is an API, which leaves it to the rest of the world to develop the actual apps that use the new API. Google and Apple have said they intend \u201cpublic health authorities \u201dto make apps. But most health authorities won \u2019t have the in-house technical resources to do that, so it \u2019s likely they will partner with private companies. Anyone who builds an app on top of the interface will have to do a lot of things right to make sure it \u2019s private and  ...\n Bad-faith app developers may try to tear down the tech giants\u2019 carefully constructed privacy guarantees. For example, although a user\u2019s data is supposed to stay on their device, an app with access to the API might be able to upload everything to a remote server. It could then link daily private keys to a   mobile ad ID  or other identifier, and exploit users\u2019 association history to profile them. It could also use the app as a \u201c  Trojan horse \u201dto convince users to agree  ...\n So, what \u2019s a responsible app developer to do? For starters, they should respect the protocol they \u2019re building on. Developers shouldn \u2019t try to graft a more \u201ccentralized \u201dprotocol, which shares more data with a central authority, on top of Apple and Google \u2019s more \u201cdecentralized \u201dmodel that keeps users \u2019data on their devices. Also, developers shouldn \u2019t share any data over the Internet beyond what is absolutely necessary: just uploading diagnosis keys when an infected  ...\n Developers should be extremely up-front with their users about what data the app is collecting and how to stop it. Users should be able to stop and start sharing RPIDs at any time. They also should be able to see the list of the RPIDs they\u2019ve received, and delete some or all of that contact history.\n  Equally important is what not to do. This is a public health crisis, not a chance to grow a startup. Developers should not force users to   sign up for an account  for anything. Also, they shouldn\u2019t ship a contact tracing app with extra, unnecessary features. The app should do its job and get out of the way, not try to onboard users to a new service.\n Obviously, proximity tracing apps shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with ads (and the   exploitative, data-sucking mess  that comes with them). Likewise, they shouldn\u2019t use   analytics libraries  that share data with third parties. In general, developers should use strong, transparent technical and policy safeguards to wall this data off to COVID-19 purposes and only COVID-19 purposes.\n The whole system depends on trust. If users don \u2019t trust that an app is working in their best interests, they will not use it. So developers need to be as transparent as possible about how their apps work and what risks are involved. They should publish source code and documentation so that tech-savvy users and independent technologists can check their work. And they should invite security audits and penetration testing from professionals to be as confident as  ...\n All of this will take time. There\u2019s a lot that can go wrong, and too much is at stake to afford rushed, sloppy software. Public health authorities and developers should take a step back and make sure they get things right. And users should be wary of any apps that ship out in the days following Apple and Google\u2019s first API release.\n   During the first phase,   Apple and Google have said that the API can \u201conly [be] used for contact tracing by public health authorities apps, \u201dwhich \u201cwill receive approval based on a specific set of criteria designed to ensure they are only administered in conjunction with public health authorities, meet our privacy requirements, and protect user data. \u201dApple and Google should be transparent and specific about exactly what these criteria are. Through these criteria,  ...\n In the second phase, the companies will build the proximity tracking technology directly into Android and iOS. This means that no app will be needed initially, though Apple and Google   propose that the user be prompted to download an public health app if an exposure match is detected. All of the recommendations for app developers above also apply to Apple and Google here. Critically, the promised opt-in must obtain specific, informed consent from each user before  ...\n  Finally, this program must sunset when the COVID-19 crisis is over. Proximity tracking apps should not be repurposed for other things, like tracking more mild seasonal flu outbreaks or finding witnesses to a crime. Google and Apple have said that they \u201ccan disable the exposure notification system on a regional basis when it is no longer needed. \u201dThis is an important ability, and Apple and Google should establish a clear, concrete plan for when to end this  ...\n There will be no quick tech solution to COVID-19.

Wondering what the right moment is to start with learning code.\n  11 and 8. I think the right moment = when they actively want to learn to program.My 11 yo definitely does and had been nagging me for a while to teach him. I could probably teach the 8 yo to program too, but I&#39;m waiting till he wants me to.\n  \u65b0\u5bf9\u8bdd  I&#39;m curious why didn&#39;t you teach them a better language? E.g., Python could express this in a much simpler and more beautiful way.\n  \u65b0\u5bf9\u8bdd  Is there an article where you explain what this is and how to use it?\n  If you click on the green &#34;run&#34; button at the top of the screen, it will print instructions.\n  \u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ed3\u675f\n  In classic Basic, every line has to have a line number.

Sometimes, packets go in circles.Other times, 1/8 of the (IPv4) Internet gets caught up in a bad route.\n Those are temporary things. Today&#39;s story of pain and suffering is one of those things which tends to stick around for a very long time. And, as a bonus, there&#39;s a way for evil readers (or just people with  really bad attitudes) to find out if their own company is one of these.\n Here&#39;s the basic premise: if you give someone your wireless network name and WPA2 passphrase (&#34;pre-shared key&#34;, if you must), they can get on your network. You knew that already. What you might not have realized is that they can now create a perfect clone of the network. Most of us don&#39;t actually have that &#34;threat model&#34; to worry about with our homes, and so giving out login details to friends is not a problem.\n Companies don&#39;t have that option. Our beekeeping friendsfrom a previous story and many others like them have a life-or-death struggle going on, particularly now that the world is caught up in this whole Twilight Zone quarantine thing. Some of them would totally do nefarious stuff to find out what the other one is up to... and have.\n But, you say, companies aren&#39;t supposed to be in that situation! They&#39;re supposed to be using the &#34;enterprise&#34; versions of this wifi stuff where you have network certificates and client certificates and actually use login names and passwords and RADIUS and stuff like that! I agree with you, companies  aren&#39;t supposed to be in that situation. Of course they aren&#39;t. But they tend to be there more often than you might think.\n Think about it. If your company would turn off STP and induce a business-ending switch loop just to fix the toilet tunes (literally, music in the bathrooms), would it run a coffee-shop grade wirelessnetwork? You better believe they would. (And apologies to actual coffee shops.)\n How can you prove it? That&#39;s easy. Grab your corporate Mac and fire up Keychain Access. Then go over to Category, pick Passwords, and sort by Kind. Then look for &#34;network password&#34;. Look for the usual network name that your Mac would be on when you&#39;re at the office. (I get that almost nobody is there right this moment due to the craziness. Go with me here.)\n Do you see an entry in there? Try opening it. There&#39;ll be a form that pops up with a little check box to display the password. Does it work? It might ask you for your login credentials, and then does it accept them and show them to you? That&#39;s the whole company&#39;s wifi password. Every single device is probably configured with it. This could be thousands or tens of thousands of machines across dozens or hundreds of physical locations.\n  Now here&#39;s where the real fun comes in. With that information, you or anyone else could grab any access point made in the past few years and configure a network with the same settings, down to the SSID (network name) and passphrase. If you then turned it on and left it near a device configured for your company network, there is a very good chance you would &#34;capture&#34; it.\n What now? Use your imagination. Spoof DNS. Set up phony web sites that look like vendors they are likely to use. Run fake login pages.\n &#34;But we use https&#34;, you think. Sure you do, sometimes. But I bet you can find something goofy that doesn&#39;t, or where someone&#39;s browser hasn&#39;t found out that site prefers https yet. Remember, all you really need to do is convince one person to type their credentials into your fake page, and now you can go in and explore much more.\n Imagine doing this on a rush-hour Caltrain or BART car where a bunch of people from the targeted company are commuting. Their phones would normally use the cellular, but if presented with a matching wireless network, would probably hop on it, particularly in the tunnels.\n This is why we don&#39;t use home grade wifi setups for multi-million-dollar businesses, assuming we want them to remain multi-million-dollar businesses and not a smoking crater of Aeron chairs. If this is your company, go scream at your IT people until they do something about it. Then consider finding a way onto the hard-wired network and stop using the company wireless network by default until they fix it.\n If they go &#34;oh yeah, we know&#34; when you show up, ask them how long they have known about it. Their answer should tell you whether there&#39;s any chance of it ever being fixed.\n  Bonus tip: try searching your intranet or even the public Internet for the password you find. If you find it on a public wiki page, send out for some stiff liquor.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 05:26:32", "tags": "\u4f01\u4e1a,times,network", "title": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e0d\u666f\u6c14", "title_en": "Bad times in corporate wireless networks", "transed": 1, "url": "https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/05/01/owned/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u4f01\u4e1a", "times", "network"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7f02c758e562421b9595746604d8887f.jpg", "infoid": 1000415, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8363\u667a\u5065\u8ba4\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u4e2a\u5e78\u8fd0\u513f\u3002\u8363\u667a\u5065\u662f\u4e00\u540d1848\u5e74\u79fb\u6c11\u5230\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5fb7\u56fd\u4eba\uff0c\u4ed6\u52aa\u529b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u8c0b\u751f\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u4e00\u5bb6\u505c\u5c38\u623f\u7684\u8001\u677f\u81f4\u5bcc\u3002\u8fd9\u7b14\u751f\u610f\u8ba9\u4ed6\u548c\u59bb\u5b50\u7f57\u897f\u5a1c\u5728\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u8857\u5c71\u7684\u5c71\u9876\u4e70\u4e86\u4e00\u5757\u4e0d\u8d77\u773c\u7684\u5730\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u4ed6\u4eec\u5efa\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u5ea7\u53e4\u8272\u53e4\u9999\u7684\u5e73\u623f\u5f0f\u4f4f\u5b85\uff0c\u5e76\u79cd\u690d\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u82b1\u56ed\u3002\u6bcf\u5929\uff0c\u52a0\u5dde\u7684\u9633\u5149\u548c\u65b0\u9c9c\u7a7a\u6c14\u90fd\u4f1a\u4ece\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7a97\u6237\u91cc\u6d8c\u5165\u3002\n\u8363\u683c\u6ca1\u6709\u7406\u7531\u76f8\u4fe1\u4efb\u4f55\u4e8b\u60c5\u90fd\u4f1a\u6253\u65ad\u4ed6\u7530\u56ed\u8bd7\u822c\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u7406\u7531\u76f8\u4fe1\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u4f1a\u4ee5\u67d0\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u5265\u593a\u4ed6\u8f9b\u8f9b\u82e6\u82e6\u4eab\u53d7\u7684\u7f8e\u597d\u65f6\u5149\u3002\u4f46\u8363\u683c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u5230\u67e5\u5c14\u65af\u00b7\u514b\u7f57\u514b(Charles Crocker)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u5bcc\u6709\u548c\u975e\u5e38\u5c0f\u6c14\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u65e2\u6210\u4e3a\u4ed6\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\uff0c\u4e5f\u6210\u4e3a\u4ed6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7978\u6839\u3002\u6709\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6728\u6750\u5728\u8363\u683c\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8d22\u4ea7\u5468\u56f4\u7b51\u8d7740\u82f1\u5c3a\u9ad8\u7684\u6805\u680f\uff0c\u514b\u7f57\u514b\u548c\u4ed6\u7684\u6028\u6068\u6805\u680f\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f20\u5947\u7684\u590d\u4ec7\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c.", "note_en": "Nicholas Yung considered himself a lucky man.

"note_en": "10 min read   My wife is big fan of Animal Crossing. I will admit that I mostlydon\u2019t understand the game but I find it very cute. She was very upset acouple of days ago when the Bank of Nook decided to cut the interestrate down to 0.05%, at which point she asked: \u201chow am I supposed tomake money now!?\u201d\n  It seems there\u2019s some sort of turnip market in the game. Basically,you can buy turnips on Sunday for a given price, and then you willhave opportunities to sell your turnips over the upcoming week. If youdon\u2019t sell them by next Sunday, you lose them (and thus materializeyour loss). You get two screen prices every day, one in the AM and onein the PM. So, you\u2019ll get 12 prices from Monday to Saturday.\n   The first question is: are turnip prices completely random? A coupleof Google searches reveal that they follow four patterns:\n  Ok, so it seems it\u2019s not completely random. In that case, we should beable to come up with a model (probabilities) for the turnip prices. Itturns out that Ninjihas already looked into the source code and figured out how thepatterns are allocated and how the prices come up. Also, TurnipProphet has already taken this andbuilt a procedure to get the probability distribution for the turnipprices.\n   Every turnip investor (speculator) has to make 12 decisions: how manyturnips to sell at every screen price. Evidently, every turnipinvestor (speculator) has a different risk appetite: I might bewilling to hold on to my turnips for longer looking for a higherpayout which might be unlikely given our probability distribution,or maybe I am not so fond of risk and I hedge my bets out as soon asthings get tough. That\u2019s all okay.\n Turns out this is all part of what we now know as  Modern PortfolioTheory (thanksMr. Markowitz). You have some risky assets, you have a risk appetite,you want to make a well diversified portfolio that minimizes thevariance of your returns, and maximizes your expected returns. Thatsounds like what we want, let\u2019s do that.\n We will model our turnips as 12 different assets: turnips we will sellon Monday AM, turnips we will sell on Monday PM, and so on. Thanks tothe work that has been done in the previous section, we know what\u2019sthe expected return of each of our 12 assets. As time progresses wewill materialize some earnings and some losses.\n Let\u2019s work with an example. I put down my turnip prices on WednesdayPM having sold zero turnips so far. TurnipProphet and got the followingprobability distribution:\n  I was too lazy to get the code for TurnipProphet to run, so I justcopy pasted it and played around with it manually:\n from collections  import defaultdict from functools  import partial import numpy  as np import pandas  as pd import scipy.optimize  as scoMONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY  = range( 6)AM, PM  =  &#34;AM&#34;,  &#34;PM&#34; def  convert_range_with_price(p, s): a, b  = s .split( &#34;to&#34;) a  = a .strip() b  = b .strip()  return list(range(int(a)  - p, int(b)  +  1  - p))turnip_price  =  98convert_range  = partial(convert_range_with_price, turnip_price)data  = [ (  0.664, { (WEDNESDAY, PM):  ...\n So, now we have our data variable holding the probability of eachpossible return (i.e. price we might get minus the price we paid forthe turnips). We can easily calculate the expectation of each asset:\n def  expectation_of(r1): exp  =  0  for p, items  in data: n  = float(len(items[r1])) exp  += (p  * sum(items[r1]))  / n  return exp\n I just assumed that if TurnipProphet says a price range of 51 to 55with 5%, 51 would have a 1% chance of happening, 52 would have a 1%chance of happening. That might obviously be wrong.\n So, going back to Markowitz, what we are interested in doing is comingup with a vector of weights for each asset (e.g. sell 50% of yourturnips on Friday PM) that is within our risk appetite (higher riskappetite means I am willing to take more risk for higher payout). Wewould like those weights to stick to the following optimizationproblem (thanks to the Wikipedia):\n    Ok that seems simple enough, we already know how to compute theexpected returns, let\u2019s build the covariance matrix:\n def  joint_prob(r1, r2): prob  = defaultdict(float)  for p, items  in data: r1_opts  = items[r1] r2_opts  = items[r2] outcomes  = float(len(r1_opts)  * len(r2_opts))  for x  in r1_opts:  for y  in r2_opts: prob[x, y]  += p  / outcomes  return prob def  covariance_of(r1, r2): E_r1  = expectation_of(r1) E_r2  = expectation_of(r2) joint  = joint_prob(r1, r2) joint_exp  =  0  for (x, y), prob  in joint .items(): joint_exp  += x  * y  * prob  return joint_exp  - E_r1  * E_r2\n We are going to calculate the joint probability distribution of thescreen prices at two different times (e.g. what\u2019s the probability thatthe price is X on Monday PM and Y on Friday PM). Using that we use thewell known covariance identity Cov(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]. Presto.\n Let\u2019s get all our turnips in a row now. We want to come up with thatvector of weights. We have an optimization problem here, we want toselect the weights that minimize the formula above. Turns out, we canuse scipy just for that.\n def  objective(weights, covs, expected_returns, risk):  # the `@` operator is matrix multiplication  return weights  @ covs  @ weights  - risk  * expected_returns  @ weights def  get_weights(data, possibilities, risk): num_assets  = len(possibilities) expected_returns_dict  = {}  for p  in poss: expected_returns_dict[p]  = expectation_of(p) er  = pd .DataFrame({ &#34;returns&#34;: expected_returns_dict}) cov_dict  = defaultdict(dict)  for x  in poss:  for y  in poss: cov_dict[x][y]  =covariance_of(x,  ...\n  In [171]: poss = [ ...: (WEDNESDAY, PM), ...: (THURSDAY, AM), ...: (THURSDAY, PM), ...: (FRIDAY, AM), ...: (FRIDAY, PM), ...: (SATURDAY, AM), ...: (SATURDAY, PM), ...: ] ...:In [172]: w, exp, covs = get_weights(data, poss, 0)In [173]: w[&#39;x&#39;]Out[173]:array([9.99973926e-01, 2.60740769e-05, 0.00000000e+00, 0.00000000e+00, 1.71303943e-17, 0.00000000e+00, 0.00000000e+00])In [174]: exp.T @ w[&#39;x&#39;]Out[174]: array([-31.99986786])In [174]: exp.T @ w[&#39;x&#39;]Out[174]:  ...\n Unsurprisingly, if we are willing to take zero risk, we are told to tosell now as that price has zero variance. The expected returns of thatallocation is losing -32 for each turnip. Let\u2019s try a couple ofdifferent risk appetites:\n In [186]: for risk in (10, 50, 100, 250, 500): ...: w, exp, covs = get_weights(data, poss, risk) ...: print(w) ...: print(exp.T @ w[&#39;x&#39;]) ...: print(w[&#39;x&#39;] @ covs @ w[&#39;x&#39;]) ...: fun: 311.77365532878 jac: array([320. , 341.42121124, 346.91123962, 320.00033188, 320.00043488, 441.86499786, 514.03258133]) message: &#39;Optimization terminated successfully.&#39; nfev: 68 nit: 6 njev: 6 status: 0 success: True x: array([9.72724596e-01, 1.01876057e-10,  ...\n So what are we observing? As our risk appetite increases, our weightsshift from \u201ccash out now\u201d to \u201cwait it out till Friday because that\u2019swhen the prices could peak\u201d, we see our expected returns steadilyincrease. However, this comes at a cost: the variance of our portfolioincreased considerably, thus we are taking on a lot more risk (andpossibility to both gain more and lose more).\n Ideally, the way you use this is that every time you have a new screenprice, you\u2019ll update your portfolio.\n On Monday AM price you\u2019ll have a new portfolio. You possibly willsell some at the current price, and have the remaining turnipshanging around.\n On Monday PM price you\u2019ll recompute the weights. You can\u2019t changewhat you already sold, that ship has gone. But you can make animproved decision (because you have more information) to update theweights of the remaining 11 decisions. You will, again, decide tosell some and keep some given your risk appetite.\n Continue until you exhaust your weekly turnips. Or evidently, yourbest friend tells you they have killer prices on their island.\n  There\u2019s an interesting scenario I didn\u2019t get to investigate but Ithink makes for a cool problem which is very similar. Every island hasa different turnip price, so turnips are more valuable in some placesthan others. Let\u2019s say you have access to many islands and access totheir turnip probability distribution.
