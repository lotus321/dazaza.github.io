[8]\n In architecture, Alexander&#39;s work is used by a number of different contemporary architectural communities of practice, including the  New Urbanist movement, to help people to reclaim control over their own built environment.  [9] However, Alexander is controversial among some mainstream architects and critics, in part because his work is often harshly critical of much of contemporary architectural theory and practice.  [10]\n Alexander is known for many books on the design and building process, including   Notes on the Synthesis of Form,  A City is Not a Tree (first published as a paper and re-published in book form in 2015),   The Timeless Way of Building, A New Theory of Urban Design, and   The Oregon Experiment. More recently he published the four-volume   The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe,about his newer theories of &#34;morphogenetic&#34;  ...\n Alexander is perhaps best known for his 1977 book   A Pattern Language, a perennial seller some four decades after publication.  [11] Reasoning that users are more sensitive to their needs than any architect could be,  [12]  [13]  [14] he produced and validated (in collaboration with his students Sara Ishikawa,  Murray Silverstein, Max Jacobson, Ingrid King, and Shlomo Angel) a &#34; pattern language&#34; to empower anyone to design and build at any scale.\n   As a young child Alexander emigrated in fall 1938  [15] with his parents from Austria to England, when his parents were forced to flee the Nazi regime. He spent much of his childhood in  Chichester and  Oxford, England, where he began his education in the sciences. He moved from England to the United States in 1958 to study at  Harvard University and  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He moved to  Berkeley, Californiain 1963 to accept an appointment  ...\n  Alexander attended  Oundle School, England. In 1954, he was awarded the top open scholarship to  Trinity College,  Cambridge University in chemistry and physics, and went on to read mathematics. He earned a  Bachelor&#39;s degree in Architecture and a  Master&#39;s degree in Mathematics. He took his doctorate at Harvard (the first  PhD in Architecture ever awarded at  Harvard University), and was elected fellow at Harvard. During the same period he worked  ...\n  Alexander was elected to the  Society of Fellows, Harvard University 1961-64; awarded the First Medal for Research by the American Institute of Architects, 1972;  [16] elected member of the Swedish Royal Academy, 1980; winner of the Best Building in Japan award, 1985; winner of the ACSA (Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture) Distinguished Professor Award, 1986 and 1987;  [17]invited to present the Louis Kahn Memorial Lecture, 1992; awarded  ...\n   The Timeless Way of Building (1979) described the perfection of use to which buildings could aspire:\n There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following  ...\n A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction (1977) described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a  generative grammar.\n The work originated from an observation that many medieval cities are attractive and harmonious. The authors said that this occurs because they were built to local regulations that required specific features, but freed the architect to adapt them to particular situations.\n The book provides rules and pictures, and leaves decisions to be taken from the precise environment of the project. It describes exact methods for constructing practical, safe and attractive designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs.\n A notable value is that the architectural system consists only of classic patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality.\n The book includes all needed surveying and structural calculations, and a novel simplified building system that copes with regional shortages of wood and steel, uses easily stored inexpensive materials, and produces long-lasting classic buildings with small amounts of materials, design and labor. It first has users prototype a structure on-site in temporary materials. Once accepted, these are finished by filling them with very-low-density concrete.  ...\n This book&#39;s method was adopted by the University of Oregon, as described in   The Oregon Experiment (1975), and remains the official planning instrument. It has also been adopted in part by some cities as a building code.\n The idea of a  pattern language appears to apply to any complex engineering task, and has been applied to some of them. It has been especially influential in  software engineering where  patterns have been used to document collective knowledge in the field.\n A New Theory of Urban Design (1987) coincided with a renewal of interest in  urbanism among architects, but stood apart from most other expressions of this by assuming a distinctly anti-masterplanning stance. An account of a design studio conducted with Berkeley students on a site in  San Francisco, it shows how convincing urban networks can be generated by requiring individual actors to respect only  localrules, in relation to neighbours.  ...\n The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe (2003\u201304), which includes The  Phenomenon of Life,  The Process of Creating Life,  A Vision of a Living World and  The Luminous Ground, is Alexander&#39;s most comprehensive and elaborate work. In it, he puts forth a new theory about the nature of space and describes how this theory influences thinking about architecture, building, planning, and the way in  ...\n The online publication  Katarxis 3 (September 2004) includes several essays by Christopher Alexander, as well as the legendary debate between Alexander and  Peter Eisenman from 1982.  [23]\n Alexander&#39;s latest book,  The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle Between Two World-Systems(2012), is the story of the largest project he and his colleagues had ever tackled, the construction of a new High School/College campus in Japan. He also uses the project to connect with themes in his four-volume series. He contrasts his approach, (System A) with the construction processes endemic in the US and Japanese economies  ...\n  Among Alexander&#39;s most notable built works are the Eishin Campus near  Tokyo (the building process of which is outlined in his 2012 book  The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth); the West Dean Visitors Centre  [24] in West Sussex, England; the Julian Street Inn (a homeless shelter) in  San Jose, California (both described in  Nature of Order); the  Sala Houseand the Martinez House (experimental houses in Albany and Martinez, California  ...\n His former student and colleague  Michael Mehaffy wrote an introductory essay on Alexander&#39;s built work in the online publication  Katarxis 3, which includes a gallery of Alexander&#39;s major built projects through September 2004.  [25]\n  In addition to his lengthy teaching career as a Professor at  UC Berkeley (during which a number of international students began to appreciate and apply his methods), Alexander was a key faculty member at both The Prince of Wales&#39;s Summer Schools in Civil Architecture (1990\u20131994) and  The Prince&#39;s Foundation for the Built Environment.  [26] He also initiated the process which led to the international  Building Beautypost-graduate  ...\n   Alexander&#39;s work has widely influenced architects; among those who acknowledge his influence are  Sarah Susanka,  [29]  Andres Duany,  [30] and  Witold Rybczynski.  [31]  Robert Campbell, the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic for the  Boston Globe, stated that Alexander &#34;has had an enormous critical influence on my life and work, and I think that&#39;s true of a whole generation of people.&#34;  [31]\n Architecture critic  Peter Buchanan, in an essay for   The Architectural Review &#39;s 2012 campaign  The Big Rethink, argues that Alexander&#39;s work as reflected in  A Pattern Language is &#34;thoroughly subversive and forward looking rather than regressive, as so many misunderstand it to be.&#34; He continues:\n  Even architects not immune to the charms of the places depicted, are loath to pursue the folksy aesthetic they see as implied and do not want to engage with such primitive construction \u2014although the systemic collapse now unfolding may force that upon them. The daunting challenge for architects then, if such a thing is even possible to realise, would be to recreate in a more contemporary idiom both the richness and quality of experience  ...\n Many urban development projects continue to incorporate Alexander&#39;s ideas. For example, in the UK the developers  Living Villages have been highly influenced by Alexander&#39;s work and used  A Pattern Language as the basis for the design of The Wintles in Bishops Castle, Shropshire.  [33]  Sarah Susanka&#39;s &#34;Not So Big House&#34; movement adapts and popularizes Alexander&#39;s patterns and outlook.\n  Alexander&#39;s   Notes on the Synthesis of Form was said to be required reading for researchers in computer science throughout the 1960s. It had an influence  [34] in the 1960s and 1970s on  programming language design, modular programming,  object-oriented programming,  software engineering and other design methodologies. Alexander&#39;s mathematical concepts and orientation were similar to  Edsger Dijkstra&#39;s influential  A Discipline  ...\n The greatest influence of   A Pattern Language in computer science is the  design patterns movement.  [36] Alexander&#39;s philosophy of incremental, organic, coherent design also influenced the  extreme programming movement.  [37] The  Wiki was invented  [6]  [7] to allow the Hillside Group to work on programming  design patterns. More recently the &#34;deep geometrical structures&#34; as discussed in   The Nature of Orderhave been cited  ...\n Will Wright wrote that Alexander&#39;s work was influential in the origin of the   SimCity computer games, and in his later game   Spore.  [39]\n Alexander has often led his own software research, such as the 1996 Gatemaker project with  Greg Bryant.  [40]  [41]\n Alexander discovered and conceived a recursive structure, so called wholeness, which is defined mathematically, exists in space and matter physically, and reflects in our minds and cognition psychologically. He had his idea of wholeness back to early 1980s when he finished his very first version of  The Nature of Order. In fact, his idea of wholeness or degree of wholeness relying a recursive structure of centers resemble in  ...\n  The fourth volume of   The Nature of Order approaches religious questions from a scientific and philosophical rather than mystical direction. In it, Alexander describes deep ties between the nature of matter,  human perception of the universe, and the geometries people construct in buildings, cities, and artifacts. He suggests a crucial link between traditional practices and  beliefs, and recent scientific advances.  [43]Despite  ...\n  The life&#39;s work of Alexander is dedicated to turn design from unselfconscious behavior to selfconscious behavior, so called design science. In his very first book  Notes on the Synthesis of Forms, he has set what he wanted to do. He was inspired by traditional buildings, and tried to derive some 253 patterns for architectural design. Later on, he further distills 15 geometric properties to characterize living structure  ...\n  In his classic  A City is Not a Tree, he already had some primary ideas of complex networks, although he used semilattice rather than complex networks. In his first book  Notes on the synthesis of forms on page 65, he illustrated something that is in fact community or community structure in complex networks, a recent topic emerged around 2004:  community structure.\n   The  Center for Environmental Structure Series, made up of Foreshadowing of 21st Century Art: The Color and Geometry of Very Early Turkish Carpets (1993)\n     The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle between Two World-Systems, with HansJoachim Neis and Maggie More Alexander (2012)\n      ^     a     b    &#34;Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A&#34;  (PDF).

"note_en": "Professor Didier Raoult said data on the spread of the virus suggested it had reached a \u201cbell curve\u201d which he claimed was a typical epidemic cycle which should rule out the prospect of a rebound.\n   Prof Raoult said: &#34;The second wave story is a fantasy that was invented from the Spanish flu, which started in the summer and has nothing to do with it.\n &#34;Usually an epidemic happens in one curve. I hate to make predictions, but this way of constructing it is fairly common for epidemics.\n \u201cIn the past, epidemics disappeared long before we had the means to contain them. They disappeared anyway.\n &#34;Humanity didn&#39;t die from an epidemic, that&#39;s the way it is. Epidemics start, accelerate, peak, disappear, and we don&#39;t know why.\u201d\n  Prof Raoult said the French government&#39;s plans to start easing lockdown measures on May 11 was justified.\n He also backed the results of a study carried out by Singaporean researchers who predicted 97 percent of COVID-19 cases in France would have happened by around May 7.\n Prof Raoult said: &#34;The data provided by the president is not extravagant. 97 percent of the cases will have occurred around 7th May and 99 percent around 19th May.\n &#34;This is the time when we should be able to confine and isolate infected people, knowing that by then the virus transmission will have become much lower.&#34;\n   Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said France would adopt an aggressive programme of COVID-19 testing from May 11 and warned citizens had to be disciplined to avoid a new outbreak.\n Mr Philippe said the lockdown had saved tens of thousands of lives but that the time had come to ease the unprecedented peacetime restrictions and rescue an economy in free-fall.\n But he warned that the infection rate would spiral if France moved too swiftly and people became complacent.\n  He said: &#34;We are on a knife&#39;s edge. I am having to choose between bad decisions.\n &#34;We must protect the French people without paralysing France to the point that it collapses.\n &#34;A little too much carefreeness and the epidemic takes off again. Too much prudence and the whole country buckles.&#34;\n    From May 11, schools will gradually reopen and businesses will be free to resume operations.\n Restaurants, cafes and beaches, though, will remain closed until at least June, while professional sports are suspended until September.\n  The planned timeline hinges on the number of new coronavirus infections remaining below 3,000 per day.\n Mr Philippe said the government would slow or delay the unwinding of the lockdown if the infection rate spiked markedly higher with administrative departments divided into red and green zones.\n He said: &#34;If the indicators are not good enough, we won&#39;t unwind the lockdown on May 11, or we will do it more strictly.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-03 16:42:31", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u4e13\u5bb6,\u6d41\u884c\u75c5", "title": "\u6cd5\u56fd\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a73\u65a5\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6ce2\u6050\u60e7\u5c06\u8b66\u544a\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3a\u5e7b\u60f3", "title_en": "French coronavirus expert REJECTS second wave fears branding warnings a fantasy", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1275573/france-coronavirus-latest-news-second-wave-covid19-lockdown-updates", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u4e13\u5bb6", "\u6d41\u884c\u75c5"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0523d9e23a4f0a6427f23cbd05bf57f2.jpg", "infoid": 1000463, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ebf\u4e07\u5bcc\u7fc1\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6c83\u4f26\u00b7\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u00b7\u54c8\u6492\u97e6\u5df2\u7ecf\u51fa\u552e\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u56db\u5927\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6240\u6709\u80a1\u4efd\u3002\n\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u5728\u5e74\u5ea6\u80a1\u4e1c\u5927\u4f1a\u4e0a\u53d1\u8868\u8bb2\u8bdd\u65f6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u3002\n\u636e\u8def\u900f\u793e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u5c31\u5728\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u53d1\u8868\u8bc4\u8bba\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u524d\uff0c\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u54c8\u6492\u97e6\u516c\u53f8\u5ba3\u5e03\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b63\u5ea6\u51c0\u4e8f\u635f\u8fbe\u5230\u521b\u7eaa\u5f55\u7684500\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143(400\u4ebf\u82f1\u9551)\u3002\n\u6839\u636e\u5176\u5e74\u62a5\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u5907\u6848\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u8be5\u96c6\u56e2\u6301\u6709\u8fbe\u7f8e\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f811%\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f810%\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\uff0c\u897f\u5357\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f810%\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f89%\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\u3002\n\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u907f\u5f00\u822a\u7a7a\u4e1a\u591a\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u4e8e2016\u5e74\u5f00\u59cb\u6295\u8d44\u8fd9\u56db\u5bb6\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u662f\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u4e1a\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e00\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u5728\u4e8f\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u628a\u94b1\u4ece\u4f01\u4e1a\u91cc\u62ff\u51fa\u6765\u7684\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8d44\u52a9\u4e00\u5bb6\u2026\u2026\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b83\u5728\u672a\u6765\u4f1a\u5403\u6389\u94b1\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002&#34\uff1b\n\u7531\u4e8e\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u51e0\u4e4e\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u53d6\u6d88\u4e86\u6570\u5341\u4e07\u4e2a\u822a\u73ed\uff0c\u6570\u5343\u67b6\u98de\u673a\u505c\u6b62\u670d\u52a1\u3002\n\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u75ab\u60c5\u6765\u88ad\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u8003\u8651\u6295\u8d44\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ece\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u8bf4\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u67af\u7aed\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6253\u51fb\u3002\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7981\u6b62\u822a\u7a7a\u65c5\u884c\u3002\n\u8fbe\u7f8e\u822a\u7a7a\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u548c\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u56e2\u961f\u6000\u6709\u6781\u5927\u7684\u656c\u610f\u3002", "note_en": "Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says his company Berkshire Hathaway has sold all of its shares in the four largest US airlines.\n Speaking at the annual shareholders&#39;

Losing access to all this data would be traumatic at best.\n In this article I\u2019m researching what happens when you forget your password or lose your phone. What information will Google want to know about you and how can you best prepare for this situation so you don\u2019t lose access to your account completely.\n I\u2019ve been using the same Google account for the last 12 years  1. And to be honest, I\u2019ve never changed the password and never turned on the 2-Step Verification  2 because I was afraid that I\u2019ll lose my phone or forget my password and I won\u2019t be able to access my account any more. I think this is not sustainable, so let\u2019s have a look at what happens when you forget your password or you lose your phone.\n  1st step -  Password (mandatory) - To prove that it is really you, you need to provide Google with a text password\n 2nd step -  You phone (optional) - Google uses different means (SMS, notifications, authenticator app) to enable your phone to uniquely identify you. On top of that it\u2019s possible to use Security keys or keys generated by your password manager, but for simplicity we\u2019ll use the phone example.\n This approach combines something you know (password) with something you have (phone) to make it much harder for someone to impersonate you (e.g. by tricking you to enter a password into a fake log-in dialogue).\n   When you follow the steps in  Google\u2019s guide, you get asked which of the following options would you\u2019d like to use:\n   Then Google asks whether I\u2019d like to use a backup number in case you lose my phone. But if I lose my phone my number is gone too since I always use prepaid. I chose to get  backup codes instead. They are single-use codes that are more versatile than a phone number.\n Tip 1: Store your backup keys in your password manager so if you don\u2019t have your phone on you, you can still log in.\n  You lost your phone and your dog ate your backup codes. Or you are having soap opera level amnesia and you don\u2019t remember your password. How do you access your Google account?\n  The algorithm used by google to evaluate your identity is not openly known. Here are the things Google will want to know from you:\n Request for providing additional details in writing (e.g. when you created your account, if you are travelling)\n Now if you answer all of these sufficiently (and ideally from the same browser and IP address that you usually use), you are going to get a link to a page where you reset your password.\n If you don\u2019t answer these questions well enough, Google won\u2019t grant you access to your account and it recommends that you forget about it and start a new one  4.\n We couldn\u2019t be sure that you\u2019re the owner. To keep accounts safe, we can\u2019t give access to them if we can\u2019t confirm who the owner is.\n  The best way to prepare for his situation is to have all your recovery information up to date. I\u2019m not sure how all these recovery options affect the security. It seems to me that if you provide too many ways how to reset your account\u2019s password, it makes it easier for someone else to do it as well.\n  The way I understand it, if you get to the \u201cAccount recovery\u201d phase, you can\u2019t be certain that you are going to get your account back. Most likely having your recovery email and phone up to date is going to be enough, but what if your IP looks really suspicious for some reason (trip to Thailand maybe)? One of my other Google accounts actually have been inactive for so long that Google doesn\u2019t trust me when I enter the password and there\u2019s no way to recover.\n There is one more option for super paranoid people. Backup all your data. For all things I dislike about Google, they do give you full access to your data. Visit  Google Takeout to back up all your data locally (for me it is 2.8GB of email that I\u2019m interested in). This approach brings its own risks. I\u2019d strongly recommend encrypting the backup otherwise you have a big portion of your online life lying in a plaintext on your hard drive.\n  I hope this article helped you to understand what might happen if you forget/lose your credentials/phone. I feel much more confident about both the security of my account and how to recover it should the situation arise.\n   Please, if you&#39;d like to share any thoughts, I&#39;m all ears.

"note_en": "Edit this page --  Back to previous index    Yes! The  git repository shows all of the work that we\u2019re currently doing. Libreboot is quite active.\n  Short answer: It\u2019s out when it\u2019s out. If you want to help out and submit patches, refer to  the Git page.\n   We\u2019ve been re-writing the entire Libreboot build system from scratch, since the previous release. This has taken longer than we expected, but the new build system is reaching maturity. We are polishing it.\n Once the new build system is stable, our next priority is ensuring that all currently supported build targets build properly in Libreboot.\n After that, the priority is to make sure that all current boards in Libreboot use the most up to date revision of coreboot, with all of the most recent fixes and improvements. Testing those boards will then be a matter of peer review, reaching out to the entire community via alpha/beta/RC releases.\n Generally, all major release-blocking issues must be addressed before a new release can be issued. See:  https://notabug.org/libreboot/libreboot/issues\n  Work on new improvements and help with testing once ROMs build for all boards, when the build system is stable.\n In particular, there are several new boards in coreboot that we can add to Libreboot, as documented on the Libreboot bug tracker. These will also have to be added, and fully tested. Instructions for setting up hardware-based flashing tools can be found in  the Libreboot installation guides\n  A few new board ports will also come in handy ;) If you\u2019ve got the skills, we\u2019d really appreciate that. Port them to coreboot first, or make existing coreboot targets work without binary blobs.\n  If you have ways to improve the documentation, you can do that too. Refer to  the Git page for instructions on submitting patches to the documentation.\n    If running  flashrom -p internal for software based flashing, and you get an error related to /dev/mem access, you should reboot with  iomem=relaxed kernel parameter before running flashrom, or use a kernel that has  CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM and  CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM not enabled.\n  flashrom v0.9.9-r1955 on Linux 4.11.9-1-ARCH (x86_64)flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.orgCalibrating delay loop...

This happens both on the original BIOS and in libreboot. It\u2019s a quirk in the hardware. On debian systems, a workaround is to restart the networking service when you connect the ethernet cable:\n      Libreboot 20160818, 20160902 and 20160907 all have a bug: in SeaBIOS, PCI options ROMs are loaded when available, by default. This is not technically a problem, because an option ROM can be free or non-free. In practise, though, they are usually non-free.\n Loading the option ROM from the PIKE2008 module on either ASUS KCMA-D8 or KGPE-D16 causes the system to hang at boot. It\u2019s possible to use this in the payload (if you use a linux kernel payload, or petitboot), or to boot (with SeaGRUB and/or SeaBIOS) from regular SATA and then use it in GNU+Linux. The Linux kernel is capable of using the PIKE2008 module without loading the option ROM.\n Libreboot-unstable (or git) now disables loading PCI option ROMs, but previous releases with SeaGRUB (20160818-20160907) do not. You can work around this by running the following command:\n  You can find  cbfstool in the _util archive with the libreboot release that you are using.\n  You can safely ignore those errors, they exist because we can\u2019t quiet down cryptomount command from  for loop in libreboot\u2019s  grub.cfg. It could be fixed in upstream grub by contributing patch that would add quiet flag to it.\n  The easiest method of doing so is by using the kernel\u2019s netconsole and reproducing the panic. Netconsole requires two machines, the one that is panicky (source) and the one that will receive crash logs (target). The source has to be connected with an ethernet cable and the target has to be reachable at the time of the panic. To set this system up, execute the following commands as root on the source ( source#) and normal user on the target  ...\n Mount configfs (only once per boot, you can check if it is already mounted with  mount | grep /sys/kernel/config. This will return no output if it is not).\n find source\u2019s ethernet interface name, it should be of the form  enp* or  eth*, see  ip address or  ifconfig output.\n   Test if the logging works by e.g.\u00a0inserting or removing an USB device on the source. There should be a few lines appearing in the terminal, in which you started netcat (nc), on the target host.\n  Some GM45 laptops have been freezing or experiencing a kernel panic (blinking caps lock LED and totaly unresponsive machine, sometimes followed by an automatic reboot within 30 seconds). We do not know what the problem(s) is(are), but a CPU microcode update in some cases prevents this from happening again. See the following bug reports for more info:\n       There are severe privacy, security and freedom issues with these laptops, due to the Intel chipsets that they use. See:\n  Most notably, these laptops also use the Intel FSP binary blob, for the entire hardware initialization. Coreboot does support a particular revision of one of their laptops, but most are either unsupported or rely on binary blobs for most of the hardware initialization.\n In particular, the Intel Management Engine is a severe threat to privacy and security, not to mention freedom, since it is a remote backdoor that provides Intel remote access to a computer where it is present.\n    It is unlikely that any post-2008 Intel hardware will ever be supported in libreboot, due to severe security and freedom issues; so severe, that  the libreboot project recommends avoiding all modern Intel hardware. If you have an Intel based system affected by the problems described below, then you should get rid of it as soon as possible. The main issues are as follows:\n  Introduced in June 2006 in Intel \u2019s 965 Express Chipset Family of (Graphics and) Memory Controller Hubs, or (G)MCHs, and the ICH8 I/O Controller Family, the Intel Management Engine (ME) is a separate computing environment physically located in the (G)MCH chip. In Q3 2009, the first generation of Intel Core i3/i5/i7 (Nehalem) CPUs and the 5 Series Chipset family of Platform Controller Hubs, or PCHs, brought a more tightly integrated  ...\n The ME consists of an ARC processor core (replaced with other processor cores in later generations of the ME), code and data caches, a timer, and a secure internal bus to which additional devices are connected, including a cryptography engine, internal ROM and RAM, memory controllers, and a   direct memory access (DMA) engineto access the host operating system \u2019s memory as well as to reserve a region of protected external memory to  ...\n The ME firmware is compressed and consists of modules that are listed in the manifest along with secure cryptographic hashes of their contents. One module is the operating system kernel, which is based on a   proprietary real-time operating system (RTOS) kernelcalled \u201cThreadX \u201d. The developer, Express Logic, sells licenses and source code for ThreadX. Customers such as Intel are forbidden from disclosing or sublicensing the ThreadX  ...\n The Active Management Technology (AMT) application, part of the Intel \u201cvPro\u201d brand, is a Web server and application code that enables remote users to power on, power off, view information about, and otherwise manage the PC. It can be   used remotely even while the PC is powered off(via Wake-on-Lan). Traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS libraries, but recall that all of the major SSL/TLS implementations have had highly publicized vulnerabilities.  ...\n Intel Boot Guard is an ME application introduced in Q2 2013 with ME firmware version 9.0 on 4th Generation Intel Core i3/i5/i7 (Haswell) CPUs. It allows a PC OEM to generate an asymmetric cryptographic keypair, install the public key in the CPU, and prevent the CPU from executing boot firmware that isn\u2019t signed with their private key. This means that   coreboot and libreboot are impossible to portto such PCs, without the OEM \u2019s  ...\n ME firmware versions 4.0 and later (Intel 4 Series and later chipsets) include an ME application for   audio and video  DRMcalled \u201cProtected Audio Video Path \u201d(PAVP). The ME receives from the host operating system an encrypted media stream and encrypted key, decrypts the key, and sends the encrypted media decrypted key to the GPU, which then decrypts the media. PAVP is also used by another ME application to draw an authentication  ...\n The Intel Management Engine with its proprietary firmware has complete access to and control over the PC: it can power on or shut down the PC, read all open files, examine all running applications, track all keys pressed and mouse movements, and even capture or display images on the screen. And it has a network interface that is demonstrably insecure, which can allow an attacker on the network to inject rootkits that completely  ...\n Before version 6.0 (that is, on systems from 2008/2009 and earlier), the ME can be disabled by setting a couple of values in the SPI flash memory. The ME firmware can then be removed entirely from the flash memory space. libreboot  does this on the Intel 4 Series systems that it supports, such as the  Libreboot X200 and  Libreboot T400. ME firmware versions 6.0 and later, which are found on all systems with an Intel Core i3/i5/i7  ...\n Due to the signature verification, developing free replacement firmware for the ME is basically impossible. The only entity capable of replacing the ME firmware is Intel. As previously stated, the ME firmware includes proprietary code licensed from third parties, so Intel couldn \u2019t release the source code even if they wanted to. And even if they developed completely new ME firmware without third-party proprietary code and  ...\n In summary, the Intel Management Engine and its applications are a backdoor with total access to and control over the rest of the PC. The ME is a threat to freedom, security, and privacy, and the libreboot project strongly recommends avoiding it entirely. Since recent versions of it can\u2019t be removed, this means avoiding all recent generations of Intel hardware.\n More information about the Management Engine can be found on various Web sites, including  me.bios.io,  unhuffme,  coreboot wiki, and  Wikipedia. The book    Platform Embedded Security Technology Revealed describes in great detail the ME\u2019s hardware architecture and firmware application modules.\n If you\u2019re stuck with the ME (non-libreboot system), you might find this interesting:  http://hardenedlinux.org/firmware/2016/11/17/neutralize_ME_firmware_on_sandybridge_and_ivybridge.html\n   On all recent Intel systems, coreboot support has revolved around integrating a blob (for each system) called the  FSP(firmware support package), which handles all of the hardware initialization, including memory and CPU initialization. Reverse engineering and replacing this blob is almost impossible, due to how complex it is. Even for the most skilled developer, it would take years to replace. Intel distributes this blob  ...\n Since the FSP is responsible for the early hardware initialization, that means it also handles SMM (System Management Mode). This is a special mode that operates below the operating system level.  It\u2019s possible that rootkits could be implemented there, which could perform a number of attacks on the user (the list is endless). Any Intel system that has the proprietary FSP blob cannot be trusted at all.In fact, several SMM  ...\n  All modern x86 CPUs (from Intel and AMD) use what is called  microcode. CPUs are extremely complex, and difficult to get right, so the circuitry is designed in a very generic way, where only basic instructions are handled in hardware. Most of the instruction set is implemented using microcode, which is low-level software running inside the CPU that can specify how the circuitry is to be used, for each instruction. The  ...\n Microcode  updatesare proprietary blobs, uploaded to the CPU at boot time, which patches the built-in microcode and disables buggy parts of the CPU to improve reliability. In the past, these updates were handled by the operating system kernel, but on all recent systems it is the boot firmware that must perform this task. Coreboot does distribute microcode updates for Intel and AMD CPUs, but libreboot cannot, because  ...\n On some older Intel CPUs, it is possible to exclude the microcode updates and not have any reliability issues in practise. All current libreboot systems work without microcode updates (otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be supported in libreboot). However, all modern Intel CPUs require the microcode updates, otherwise the system will not boot at all, or it will be extremely unstable (memory corruption, for example).\n Intel CPU microcode updates are  signed, which means that you could not even run a modified version, even if you had the source code. If you try to upload your own modified updates, the CPU will reject them.\n The microcode updates alter the way instructions behave on the CPU. That means they affect the way the CPU works, in a very fundamental way. That makes it software. The updates are proprietary, and are software, so we exclude them from libreboot. The microcode built into the CPU already is not so much of an issue, since we can\u2019t change it anyway (it\u2019s read-only).\n  For years, coreboot has been struggling against Intel. Intel has been shown to be extremely uncooperative in general. Many coreboot developers, and companies, have tried to get Intel to cooperate; namely, releasing source code for the firmware components. Even Google, which sells millions of  chromebooks (coreboot preinstalled) have been unable to persuade them.\n Even when Intel does cooperate, they still don\u2019t provide source code. They might provide limited information (datasheets) under strict corporate NDA (non-disclosure agreement), but even that is not guaranteed. Even ODMs and IBVs can\u2019t get source code from Intel, in most cases (they will just integrate the blobs that Intel provides).\n  Intel is  only going to get worse when it comes to user freedom. Libreboot has no support recent Intel platforms, precisely because of the problems described above. The only way to solve this is to get Intel to change their policies and to be more friendly to the  free softwarecommunity. Reverse engineering won \u2019t solve anything long-term, unfortunately, but we need to keep doing it anyway. Moving forward, Intel  ...\n Basically, all Intel hardware from year 2010 and beyond will never be supported by libreboot. The libreboot project is actively ignoring all modern Intel hardware at this point, and focusing on alternative platforms.\n  It is extremely unlikely that any post-2013 AMD hardware will ever be supported in libreboot, due to severe security and freedom issues; so severe, that  the libreboot project recommends avoiding all modern AMD hardware. If you have an AMD based system affected by the problems described below, then you should get rid of it as soon as possible. The main issues are as follows:\n   This is basically AMD\u2019s own version of the  Intel Management Engine. It has all of the same basic security and freedom issues, although the implementation is wildly different.\n The Platform Security Processor (PSP) is built in on all Family 16h + systems (basically anything post-2013), and controls the main x86 core startup. PSP firmware is cryptographically signed with a strong key similar to the Intel ME. If the PSP firmware is not present, or if the AMD signing key is not present, the x86 cores will not be released from reset, rendering the system inoperable.\n The PSP is an ARM core with TrustZone technology, built onto the main CPU die. As such, it has the ability to hide its own program code, scratch RAM, and any data it may have taken and stored from the lesser-privileged x86 system RAM (kernel encryption keys, login data, browsing history, keystrokes, who knows!). To make matters worse, the PSP theoretically has access to the entire system memory space (AMD  ...\n In theory any malicious entity with access to the AMD signing key would be able to install persistent malware that could not be eradicated without an external flasher and a known good PSP image. Furthermore, multiple security vulnerabilities have been demonstrated in AMD firmware in the past, and there is every reason to assume one or more zero day vulnerabilities are lurking in the PSP firmware. Given the  ...\n Much like with the Intel Boot Guard (an application of the Intel Management Engine), AMD \u2019s PSP can also act as a tyrant by checking signatures on any boot firmware that you flash, making replacement boot firmware (e.g. libreboot, coreboot) impossible on some boards. Early anecdotal reports indicate that AMD \u2019s boot guard counterpart will be used on most OEM hardware, disabled only on so-called \u201centhusiast  ...\n    Handles some power management for PCIe devices (without this, your laptop will not work properly) and several other power management related features.\n The firmware is signed, although on older AMD hardware it is a symmetric key, which means that with access to the key (if leaked) you could sign your own modified version and run it. Rudolf Marek (coreboot hacker) found out how to extract this key  in this video demonstration, and based on this work, Damien Zammit (another coreboot hacker)  partially replaced itwith free firmware, but on the relevant system  ...\n  This is responsible for virtually all core hardware initialization on modern AMD systems. In 2011, AMD started cooperating with the coreboot project, releasing this as source code under a free license. In 2014, they stopped releasing source code and started releasing AGESA as binary blobs instead. This makes AGESA now equivalent to  Intel FSP.\n  Read the Intel section practically the same, though it was found with much later hardware in AMD that you could run without microcode updates. It\u2019s unknown whether the updates are needed on all AMD boards (depends on CPU).\n  AMD seemed like it was on the right track in 2011 when it started cooperating with and releasing source code for several critical components to the coreboot project. It was not to be. For so-called economic reasons, they decided that it was not worth the time to invest in the coreboot project anymore.\n For a company to go from being so good, to so bad, in just 3 years, shows that something is seriously wrong with AMD. Like Intel, they do not deserve your money.\n Given the current state of Intel hardware with the Management Engine, it is our opinion that all performant x86 hardware newer than the AMD Family 15h CPUs (on AMD \u2019s side) or anything post-2009 on Intel \u2019s side is defective by design and cannot safely be used to store, transmit, or process sensitive data. Sensitive data is any data in which a data breach would cause significant economic harm to  ...\n  Libreboot has support for fam15h AMD hardware (~2012 gen) and some older Intel platforms like Napa, Montevina, Eagle Lake, Lakeport (2004-2006). We also have support for some ARM chipsets (rk3288). On the Intel side, we\u2019re also interested in some of the chipsets that use Atom CPUs (rebranded from older chipsets, mostly using ich7-based southbridges).\n  Short answer: yes. These laptops also have an Intel GPU inside, which libreboot uses. The ATI GPU is ignored by libreboot.\n These laptops use what is called  switchable graphics, where it will have both an Intel and ATI GPU. Coreboot will allow you to set (using nvramtool) a parameter, specifying whether you would like to use Intel or ATI. The ATI GPU lacks free native graphics initialization in coreboot, unlike the Intel GPU.\n Libreboot modifies coreboot, in such a way where this nvramtool setting is ignored. Libreboot will just assume that you want to use the Intel GPU. Therefore, the ATI GPU is completely disabled on these laptops. Intel is used instead, with the free native graphics initialization (VBIOS replacement) that exists in coreboot.\n   A common issue with desktop hardware is the Video BIOS, when no onboard video is present, since every video card has a different Video BIOS. Onboard GPUs also require one, so those still have to be replaced with free software (non-trivial task). Libreboot has to initialize the graphics chipset, but most graphics cards lack a free Video BIOS for this purpose. Some desktop motherboards supported  ...\n  Most likely not. First, you must consult coreboot\u2019s own hardware compatibility list at  http://www.coreboot.org/Supported_Motherboardsand, if it is supported, check whether it can run without any proprietary blobs in the ROM image. If it can: wonderful! Libreboot can support it, and you can add support for it. If not, then you will need to figure out how to reverse engineer and replace (or remove)  ...\n For those systems where no coreboot support exists, you must first port it to coreboot and, if it can then run without any blobs in the ROM image, it can be added to libreboot. See:  Motherboard Porting Guide (this is just the tip of the iceberg!)\n Please note that board development should be done upstream (in coreboot) and merged downstream (into libreboot). This is the correct way to do it, and it is how the libreboot project is coordinated so as to avoid too much forking of the coreboot source code.\n  Libreboot has support for some ARM based laptops, using the  Rockchip RK3288 SoC. Check the libreboot  hardware compatibility list, for more information.\n      It\u2019s possible to use a 16-pin SOIC test clip on an 8-pin SOIC chip, if you align the pins properly. The connection is generally more sturdy.\n  If you are using the GRUB payload, you can add a username and password (salted, hashed) to your GRUB configuration that resides inside the flash chip. The following guides (which also cover full disk encryption, including the /boot/ directory) show how to set a boot password in GRUB:  (Installing Debian or Devuan with FDE) and  (Installing Parabola or Arch GNU+Linux-Libre, with FDE)\n  By default, there is no write-protection on a libreboot system. This is for usability reasons, because most people do not have easy access to an external programmer for re-flashing their firmware, or they find it inconvenient to use an external programmer.\n On some systems, it is possible to write-protect the firmware, such that it is rendered read-only at the OS level (external flashing is still possible, using dedicated hardware). For example, on current GM45 laptops (e.g.\u00a0ThinkPad X200, T400), you can write-protect (see  ICH9 gen utility).\n It\u2019s possible to write-protect on all libreboot systems, but the instructions need to be written. The documentation is in the main git repository, so you are welcome to submit patches adding these instructions.\n  Libreboot actually uses the  GRUB payload. More information about payloads can be found at  coreboot.org/Payloads.\n Libreboot inherits the modular payload concept from coreboot, which means that pre-OS bare-metal  BIOS setup programs are not very practical. Coreboot (and libreboot) does include a utility called  nvramtool, which can be used to change some settings. You can find nvramtool under  coreboot/util/nvramtool/, in the libreboot source archives.\n The  -a option in nvramtool will list the available options, and  -w can be used to change them. Consult the nvramtool documentation on the coreboot wiki for more information.\n In practise, you don\u2019t need to change any of those settings, in most cases.\n Libreboot locks the CMOS table, to ensure consistent functionality for all users. You can use:\n  This will change the default inside that ROM image, and then you can re-flash it.\n  Libreboot integrates the GRUB bootloader already, as a   payload. This means that the GRUB bootloader is actually  flashed, as part of the boot firmware (libreboot). This means that you do not have to install a boot loader on the HDD or SSD, when installing a new distribution. You\u2019ll be able to boot just fine, using the bootloader (GRUB) that is in the flash chip.\n This also means that even if you remove the HDD or SSD, you\u2019ll still have a functioning bootloader installed which could be used to boot a live distribution installer from a USB flash drive. See  How to install GNU+Linux on a libreboot system\n  Not anymore. Recent versions of libreboot (using the GRUB payload) will automatically switch to a GRUB configuration on the HDD or SSD, if it exists. You can also load a different GRUB configuration, from any kind of device that is supported in GRUB (such as a USB flash drive). For more information, see  Modifying the GRUB Configuration in Libreboot Systems\n           The main freedom issue on any system, is the boot firmware (usually referred to as a BIOS or UEFI). Libreboot replaces the boot firmware with fully free code, but even with libreboot, there may still be other hardware components in the system (e.g. laptop) that run their own dedicated firmware, sometimes proprietary. These are on secondary processors, where the firmware is  ...\n Note that these issues are not unique to libreboot systems. They apply universally, to most systems. The issues described below are the most common (or otherwise critical).\n   The Video BIOS is present on most video cards. For integrated graphics, the VBIOS (special kind of OptionROM) is usually embedded in the main boot firmware. For external graphics, the VBIOS is usually on the graphics card itself. This is usually proprietary; the only difference is that SeaBIOS can execute it (alternatively, you embed it in a coreboot ROM image and have coreboot  ...\n On current libreboot systems, instead of VBIOS, coreboot native GPU init is used, which is currently only implemented for Intel GPUs. Other cards with proper KMS drivers can be initialized once Linux boots, but copy of VBIOS may be still needed to fetch proper VRAM frequency and other similar parameters (without executing VBIOS code).\n In configurations where SeaBIOS and native GPU init are used together, a special shim VBIOS is added that uses coreboot linear framebuffer.\n  Most (all?) laptops have this. The EC (embedded controller) is a small, separate processor that basically processes inputs/outputs that are specific to laptops. For example:\n When you flick the radio on/off switch, the EC will enable/disable the wireless devices (wifi, bluetooth, etc) and enable/disable an LED that indicates whether it\u2019s turned on or not\n Listen to another chip that produces temperature readings, adjusting fan speeds accordingly (or turning the fan(s) on/off).\n Alexander Couzens from coreboot (lynxis on coreboot IRC) is working on a free EC firmware replacement for the ThinkPads that are supported in libreboot. See:  https://github.com/lynxis/h8s-ec (not ready yet).\n Most (all?) chromebooks have free EC firmware. Libreboot is currently looking into supporting a few ARM-based chromebooks.\n EC is present on nearly all laptops. Other devices use, depending on complexity, either EC or variant with firmware in Mask ROM - SuperIO.\n  HDDs and SSDs have firmware in them, intended to handle the internal workings of the device while exposing a simple, standard interface (such as AHCI/SATA) that the OS software can use, generically. This firmware is transparent to the user of the drive.\n HDDs and SSDs are quite complex, and these days contain quite complex hardware which is even capable of running an entire operating system (by this, we mean that the drive itself is capable of running its own embedded OS), even GNU+Linux or BusyBox/Linux.\n SSDs and HDDs are a special case, since they are persistent storage devices as well as computers.\n Example attack that malicious firmware could do: substitute your SSH keys, allowing unauthorized remote access by an unknown adversary. Or maybe substitute your GPG keys. SATA drives can also have DMA (through the controller), which means that they could read from system memory; the drive can have its own hidden storage, theoretically, where it could read your  ...\n With proper IOMMU and use of USB instead of SATA, it might be possible to mitigate any DMA-related issues that could arise.\n  Viable free replacement firmware is currently unknown to exist. For SSDs, the  OpenSSD project may be interesting.\n Apparently, SATA drives themselves don\u2019t have DMA but can make use of it through the controller. This  http://www.lttconn.com/res/lttconn/pdres/201005/20100521170123066.pdf (pages 388-414, 420-421, 427, 446-465, 492-522, 631-638) and this  http://www.intel.co.uk/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/technical-specifications/serial-ata-ahci-spec-rev1_3.pdf(pages  ...\n The following is based on discussion with Peter Stuge (CareBear\\) in the coreboot IRC channel on Friday, 18 September 2015, when investigating whether the SATA drive itself can make use of DMA. The following is based on the datasheets linked above:\n According to those linked documents, FIS type 39h is  \u201cDMA Activate FIS - Device to Host\u201d. It mentions  \u201ctransfer of data from the host to the device, and goes on to say: Upon receiving a DMA Activate, if the host adapter \u2019s DMA controller has been programmed and armed, the host adapter shall initiate the transmission of a Data FIS and shall transmit in this  ...\n Based on this, it\u2019s safe to say that use of USB instead of SATA is advisable if security is a concern. USB 2.0 has plenty of bandwidth for many HDDs (a few high-end ones can use more bandwidth than USB 2.0 is capable of), but for SSDs it might be problematic (unless you\u2019re using USB 3.0, which is not yet usable in freedom. See\n Use of USB is also not an absolute guarantee of safety, so do beware. The attack surface becomes much smaller, but a malicious drive could still attempt a \u201cfuzzing \u201dattack (e.g. sending malformed USB descriptors, which is how the tyrant DRM on the Playstation 3 was broken, so that users could run their own operating system and run unsigned code). (you \u2019 ...\n   It is recommended that you use full disk encryption, on HDDs connected via USB. There are several adapters available online, that allow you to connect SATA HDDs via USB. Libreboot documents how to install several distributions with full disk encryption. You can adapt these for use with USB drives:\n  The current theory (unproven) is that this will at least prevent malicious drives from wrongly manipulating data being read from or written to the drive, since it can \u2019t access your LUKS key if it \u2019s only ever in RAM, provided that the HDD doesn \u2019t have DMA (USB devices don \u2019t have DMA). The worst that it could do in this case is destroy your data. Of  ...\n  Ethernet NICs will typically run firmware inside, which is responsible for initializing the device internally. Theoretically, it could be configured to drop packets, or even modify them.\n With proper IOMMU, it might be possible to mitigate the DMA-related issues. A USB NIC can also be used, which does not have DMA.\n  Implements an instruction set. See description. Here we mean microcode built in to the CPU. We are not talking about the updates supplied by the boot firmware (libreboot does not include microcode updates, and only supports systems that will work without it) Microcode can be very powerful. No proof that it\u2019s malicious, but it could theoretically\n There isn\u2019t really a way to solve this, unless you use a CPU which does not have microcode. (ARM CPUs don\u2019t, but most ARM systems require blobs for the graphics hardware at present, and typically have other things like soldered wifi which might require blobs)\n CPUs often on modern systems have a processor inside it for things like power management. ARM for example, has lots of these.\n  Sound hardware (integrated or discrete) typically has firmware on it (DSP) for processing input/output. Again, a USB DAC is a good workaround.\n  Webcams have firmware integrated into them that process the image input into the camera; adjusting focus, white balancing and so on. Can use USB webcam hardware, to work around potential DMA issues; integrated webcams (on laptops, for instance) are discouraged by the libreboot project.\n  Doesn\u2019t really apply to current libreboot systems (none of them have USB 3.0 at the moment), but USB 3.0 host controllers typically rely on firmware to implement the XHCI specification. Some newer coreboot ports also require this blob, if you want to use USB 3.0.\n This doesn\u2019t affect libreboot at the moment, because all current systems that are supported only have older versions of USB available. USB devices also don\u2019t have DMA (but the USB host controller itself does).\n With proper IOMMU, it might be possible to mitigate the DMA-related issues (with the host controller).\n  Some laptops might have a simcard reader in them, with a card for handling WWAN, connecting to a 3g/4g (e.g.\u00a0GSM) network. This is the same technology used in mobile phones, for remote network access (e.g.\u00a0internet).\n NOTE: not to be confused with wifi. Wifi is a different technology, and entirely unrelated.\n The baseband processor inside the WWAN chip will have its own embedded operating system, most likely proprietary. Use of this technology also implies the same privacy issues as with mobile phones (remote tracking by the GSM network, by triangulating the signal).\n On some laptops, these cards use USB (internally), so won \u2019t have DMA, but it \u2019s still a massive freedom and privacy issue. If you have an internal WWAN chip/card, the libreboot project recommends that you disable and (ideally, if possible) physically remove the hardware. If you absolutely must use this technology, an external USB dongle  ...\n Use of ethernet or wifi is recommended, as opposed to mobile networks, as these are generally much safer.\n On all current libreboot laptops, it is possible to remove the WWAN card and sim card if it exists. The WWAN card is next to the wifi card, and the sim card (if installed) will be in a slot underneath the battery, or next to the RAM.\n   Absolutely! It is well-tested in libreboot, and highly recommended. See  installing GNU+Linux and  booting GNU+Linux.\n Any recent distribution should work, as long as it uses KMS (kernel mode setting) for the graphics.\n  On Fedora, by default the grub.cfg tries to boot linux in 16-bit mode. You just have to modify Fedora\u2019s GRUB configuration. Refer to  the GNU+Linux page.\n       Libreboot on all devices only provides host hardware init firmware images, that can be written 25XX SPI NOR Flash. But on many systems there are a lot more computers running blob firmware. Some of them are not practicable to replace due to being located on Mask ROM.

"note_en": "I had been working as a software engineer for 10 years. I started out working as a contract front-end engineer with no benefits.\n  One day, my Dad told me to get an \u201cactual\u201d job. At least talk to somebody.\n    I slowly work my way to the position of Team Lead. I picked up back-end development and did client-facing work along the way.\n  Things were fast-moving and nimble. It had to be when you are in the cut-throat consultancy industry. I met a bunch of smart people and absorbed tons of values.\n The firm was very flexible in terms of side projects. I built and ditched multiple projects. The only surviving ones are:\n   Towards the last few years at the consultancy firm, I started to burn out. My intrinsic motivation towards work was dropping like crazy.\n I took sabbatical leave (roughly 1\u20132 months) to try to clear my head. Every year, I told myself I would find new-found strength after my sabbatical.\n    A few days, I handed in my resignation letter. A recruiter called me, asking me if I was interested in joining a tech firm \u2014 Zendesk.\n  The money was good and I got vested stocks from a company that is listed on NYSE.\n    The first year at Zendesk went past quickly. Technically, I improved leaps and bounds in a short period of time.\n I wondered if I had the opportunity to join a fast-growing tech company at a younger age, things might have turned out differently.\n But alas, the familiar feeling of burn out slowly crept back. My intrinsic motivation was dropping again.\n   I\u2019m not burned out from working in tech. I\u2019m burned out from  working for someone else.\n Tired of using my time and energy in exchange for finite rewards so that someone at the top can benefit infinitely.\n   While working at Zendesk, I was experimenting with side projects too. One particular project (let\u2019s call it Project H) started to generate revenue.\n And the revenue started to grow. The growth was picking some speed. (Hindsight 101: When your data points are few, every change is amplified)\n At the point of evaluation, the revenue was around 25% of my salary (excluding the value of the stocks).\n Based on my savings, I also had 1-year runway of expenses. (I was not a good saver for the majority of my adulthood)\n Lastly, I did a stupidly simple revenue projection of Project H based on the current growth.\n Naively, I decided I\u2019m all set to strike out on my own and fully focus on Project H.\n   I\u2019m writing this article one year after I officially left tech and started my journey of solo-preneurship.\n Have I become more fulfilled? Yes and no. (That\u2019s a story for another time)\n Project H has grown to a point where it allows me to sustain my former lifestyle.\n I made tons of mistakes while learning to be profitable.

"note_en": "Edit this page --  Back to previous index    Yes! The  git repository shows all of the work that we\u2019re currently doing. Libreboot is quite active.\n  Short answer: It\u2019s out when it\u2019s out. If you want to help out and submit patches, refer to  the Git page.\n   We\u2019ve been re-writing the entire Libreboot build system from scratch, since the previous release. This has taken longer than we expected, but the new build system is reaching maturity. We are polishing it.\n Once the new build system is stable, our next priority is ensuring that all currently supported build targets build properly in Libreboot.\n After that, the priority is to make sure that all current boards in Libreboot use the most up to date revision of coreboot, with all of the most recent fixes and improvements. Testing those boards will then be a matter of peer review, reaching out to the entire community via alpha/beta/RC releases.\n Generally, all major release-blocking issues must be addressed before a new release can be issued. See:  https://notabug.org/libreboot/libreboot/issues\n  Work on new improvements and help with testing once ROMs build for all boards, when the build system is stable.\n In particular, there are several new boards in coreboot that we can add to Libreboot, as documented on the Libreboot bug tracker. These will also have to be added, and fully tested. Instructions for setting up hardware-based flashing tools can be found in  the Libreboot installation guides\n  A few new board ports will also come in handy ;) If you\u2019ve got the skills, we\u2019d really appreciate that. Port them to coreboot first, or make existing coreboot targets work without binary blobs.\n  If you have ways to improve the documentation, you can do that too. Refer to  the Git page for instructions on submitting patches to the documentation.\n    If running  flashrom -p internal for software based flashing, and you get an error related to /dev/mem access, you should reboot with  iomem=relaxed kernel parameter before running flashrom, or use a kernel that has  CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM and  CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM not enabled.\n  flashrom v0.9.9-r1955 on Linux 4.11.9-1-ARCH (x86_64)flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.orgCalibrating delay loop...

This happens both on the original BIOS and in libreboot. It\u2019s a quirk in the hardware. On debian systems, a workaround is to restart the networking service when you connect the ethernet cable:\n      Libreboot 20160818, 20160902 and 20160907 all have a bug: in SeaBIOS, PCI options ROMs are loaded when available, by default. This is not technically a problem, because an option ROM can be free or non-free. In practise, though, they are usually non-free.\n Loading the option ROM from the PIKE2008 module on either ASUS KCMA-D8 or KGPE-D16 causes the system to hang at boot. It\u2019s possible to use this in the payload (if you use a linux kernel payload, or petitboot), or to boot (with SeaGRUB and/or SeaBIOS) from regular SATA and then use it in GNU+Linux. The Linux kernel is capable of using the PIKE2008 module without loading the option ROM.\n Libreboot-unstable (or git) now disables loading PCI option ROMs, but previous releases with SeaGRUB (20160818-20160907) do not. You can work around this by running the following command:\n  You can find  cbfstool in the _util archive with the libreboot release that you are using.\n  You can safely ignore those errors, they exist because we can\u2019t quiet down cryptomount command from  for loop in libreboot\u2019s  grub.cfg. It could be fixed in upstream grub by contributing patch that would add quiet flag to it.\n  The easiest method of doing so is by using the kernel\u2019s netconsole and reproducing the panic. Netconsole requires two machines, the one that is panicky (source) and the one that will receive crash logs (target). The source has to be connected with an ethernet cable and the target has to be reachable at the time of the panic. To set this system up, execute the following commands as root on the source ( source#) and normal user on the target  ...\n Mount configfs (only once per boot, you can check if it is already mounted with  mount | grep /sys/kernel/config. This will return no output if it is not).\n find source\u2019s ethernet interface name, it should be of the form  enp* or  eth*, see  ip address or  ifconfig output.\n   Test if the logging works by e.g.\u00a0inserting or removing an USB device on the source. There should be a few lines appearing in the terminal, in which you started netcat (nc), on the target host.\n  Some GM45 laptops have been freezing or experiencing a kernel panic (blinking caps lock LED and totaly unresponsive machine, sometimes followed by an automatic reboot within 30 seconds). We do not know what the problem(s) is(are), but a CPU microcode update in some cases prevents this from happening again. See the following bug reports for more info:\n       There are severe privacy, security and freedom issues with these laptops, due to the Intel chipsets that they use. See:\n  Most notably, these laptops also use the Intel FSP binary blob, for the entire hardware initialization. Coreboot does support a particular revision of one of their laptops, but most are either unsupported or rely on binary blobs for most of the hardware initialization.\n In particular, the Intel Management Engine is a severe threat to privacy and security, not to mention freedom, since it is a remote backdoor that provides Intel remote access to a computer where it is present.\n    It is unlikely that any post-2008 Intel hardware will ever be supported in libreboot, due to severe security and freedom issues; so severe, that  the libreboot project recommends avoiding all modern Intel hardware. If you have an Intel based system affected by the problems described below, then you should get rid of it as soon as possible. The main issues are as follows:\n  Introduced in June 2006 in Intel \u2019s 965 Express Chipset Family of (Graphics and) Memory Controller Hubs, or (G)MCHs, and the ICH8 I/O Controller Family, the Intel Management Engine (ME) is a separate computing environment physically located in the (G)MCH chip. In Q3 2009, the first generation of Intel Core i3/i5/i7 (Nehalem) CPUs and the 5 Series Chipset family of Platform Controller Hubs, or PCHs, brought a more tightly integrated  ...\n The ME consists of an ARC processor core (replaced with other processor cores in later generations of the ME), code and data caches, a timer, and a secure internal bus to which additional devices are connected, including a cryptography engine, internal ROM and RAM, memory controllers, and a   direct memory access (DMA) engineto access the host operating system \u2019s memory as well as to reserve a region of protected external memory to  ...\n The ME firmware is compressed and consists of modules that are listed in the manifest along with secure cryptographic hashes of their contents. One module is the operating system kernel, which is based on a   proprietary real-time operating system (RTOS) kernelcalled \u201cThreadX \u201d. The developer, Express Logic, sells licenses and source code for ThreadX. Customers such as Intel are forbidden from disclosing or sublicensing the ThreadX  ...\n The Active Management Technology (AMT) application, part of the Intel \u201cvPro\u201d brand, is a Web server and application code that enables remote users to power on, power off, view information about, and otherwise manage the PC. It can be   used remotely even while the PC is powered off(via Wake-on-Lan). Traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS libraries, but recall that all of the major SSL/TLS implementations have had highly publicized vulnerabilities.  ...\n Intel Boot Guard is an ME application introduced in Q2 2013 with ME firmware version 9.0 on 4th Generation Intel Core i3/i5/i7 (Haswell) CPUs. It allows a PC OEM to generate an asymmetric cryptographic keypair, install the public key in the CPU, and prevent the CPU from executing boot firmware that isn\u2019t signed with their private key. This means that   coreboot and libreboot are impossible to portto such PCs, without the OEM \u2019s  ...\n ME firmware versions 4.0 and later (Intel 4 Series and later chipsets) include an ME application for   audio and video  DRMcalled \u201cProtected Audio Video Path \u201d(PAVP). The ME receives from the host operating system an encrypted media stream and encrypted key, decrypts the key, and sends the encrypted media decrypted key to the GPU, which then decrypts the media. PAVP is also used by another ME application to draw an authentication  ...\n The Intel Management Engine with its proprietary firmware has complete access to and control over the PC: it can power on or shut down the PC, read all open files, examine all running applications, track all keys pressed and mouse movements, and even capture or display images on the screen. And it has a network interface that is demonstrably insecure, which can allow an attacker on the network to inject rootkits that completely  ...\n Before version 6.0 (that is, on systems from 2008/2009 and earlier), the ME can be disabled by setting a couple of values in the SPI flash memory. The ME firmware can then be removed entirely from the flash memory space. libreboot  does this on the Intel 4 Series systems that it supports, such as the  Libreboot X200 and  Libreboot T400. ME firmware versions 6.0 and later, which are found on all systems with an Intel Core i3/i5/i7  ...\n Due to the signature verification, developing free replacement firmware for the ME is basically impossible. The only entity capable of replacing the ME firmware is Intel. As previously stated, the ME firmware includes proprietary code licensed from third parties, so Intel couldn \u2019t release the source code even if they wanted to. And even if they developed completely new ME firmware without third-party proprietary code and  ...\n In summary, the Intel Management Engine and its applications are a backdoor with total access to and control over the rest of the PC. The ME is a threat to freedom, security, and privacy, and the libreboot project strongly recommends avoiding it entirely. Since recent versions of it can\u2019t be removed, this means avoiding all recent generations of Intel hardware.\n More information about the Management Engine can be found on various Web sites, including  me.bios.io,  unhuffme,  coreboot wiki, and  Wikipedia. The book    Platform Embedded Security Technology Revealed describes in great detail the ME\u2019s hardware architecture and firmware application modules.\n If you\u2019re stuck with the ME (non-libreboot system), you might find this interesting:  http://hardenedlinux.org/firmware/2016/11/17/neutralize_ME_firmware_on_sandybridge_and_ivybridge.html\n   On all recent Intel systems, coreboot support has revolved around integrating a blob (for each system) called the  FSP(firmware support package), which handles all of the hardware initialization, including memory and CPU initialization. Reverse engineering and replacing this blob is almost impossible, due to how complex it is. Even for the most skilled developer, it would take years to replace. Intel distributes this blob  ...\n Since the FSP is responsible for the early hardware initialization, that means it also handles SMM (System Management Mode). This is a special mode that operates below the operating system level.  It\u2019s possible that rootkits could be implemented there, which could perform a number of attacks on the user (the list is endless). Any Intel system that has the proprietary FSP blob cannot be trusted at all.In fact, several SMM  ...\n  All modern x86 CPUs (from Intel and AMD) use what is called  microcode. CPUs are extremely complex, and difficult to get right, so the circuitry is designed in a very generic way, where only basic instructions are handled in hardware. Most of the instruction set is implemented using microcode, which is low-level software running inside the CPU that can specify how the circuitry is to be used, for each instruction. The  ...\n Microcode  updatesare proprietary blobs, uploaded to the CPU at boot time, which patches the built-in microcode and disables buggy parts of the CPU to improve reliability. In the past, these updates were handled by the operating system kernel, but on all recent systems it is the boot firmware that must perform this task. Coreboot does distribute microcode updates for Intel and AMD CPUs, but libreboot cannot, because  ...\n On some older Intel CPUs, it is possible to exclude the microcode updates and not have any reliability issues in practise. All current libreboot systems work without microcode updates (otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be supported in libreboot). However, all modern Intel CPUs require the microcode updates, otherwise the system will not boot at all, or it will be extremely unstable (memory corruption, for example).\n Intel CPU microcode updates are  signed, which means that you could not even run a modified version, even if you had the source code. If you try to upload your own modified updates, the CPU will reject them.\n The microcode updates alter the way instructions behave on the CPU. That means they affect the way the CPU works, in a very fundamental way. That makes it software. The updates are proprietary, and are software, so we exclude them from libreboot. The microcode built into the CPU already is not so much of an issue, since we can\u2019t change it anyway (it\u2019s read-only).\n  For years, coreboot has been struggling against Intel. Intel has been shown to be extremely uncooperative in general. Many coreboot developers, and companies, have tried to get Intel to cooperate; namely, releasing source code for the firmware components. Even Google, which sells millions of  chromebooks (coreboot preinstalled) have been unable to persuade them.\n Even when Intel does cooperate, they still don\u2019t provide source code. They might provide limited information (datasheets) under strict corporate NDA (non-disclosure agreement), but even that is not guaranteed. Even ODMs and IBVs can\u2019t get source code from Intel, in most cases (they will just integrate the blobs that Intel provides).\n  Intel is  only going to get worse when it comes to user freedom. Libreboot has no support recent Intel platforms, precisely because of the problems described above. The only way to solve this is to get Intel to change their policies and to be more friendly to the  free softwarecommunity. Reverse engineering won \u2019t solve anything long-term, unfortunately, but we need to keep doing it anyway. Moving forward, Intel  ...\n Basically, all Intel hardware from year 2010 and beyond will never be supported by libreboot. The libreboot project is actively ignoring all modern Intel hardware at this point, and focusing on alternative platforms.\n  It is extremely unlikely that any post-2013 AMD hardware will ever be supported in libreboot, due to severe security and freedom issues; so severe, that  the libreboot project recommends avoiding all modern AMD hardware. If you have an AMD based system affected by the problems described below, then you should get rid of it as soon as possible. The main issues are as follows:\n   This is basically AMD\u2019s own version of the  Intel Management Engine. It has all of the same basic security and freedom issues, although the implementation is wildly different.\n The Platform Security Processor (PSP) is built in on all Family 16h + systems (basically anything post-2013), and controls the main x86 core startup. PSP firmware is cryptographically signed with a strong key similar to the Intel ME. If the PSP firmware is not present, or if the AMD signing key is not present, the x86 cores will not be released from reset, rendering the system inoperable.\n The PSP is an ARM core with TrustZone technology, built onto the main CPU die. As such, it has the ability to hide its own program code, scratch RAM, and any data it may have taken and stored from the lesser-privileged x86 system RAM (kernel encryption keys, login data, browsing history, keystrokes, who knows!). To make matters worse, the PSP theoretically has access to the entire system memory space (AMD  ...\n In theory any malicious entity with access to the AMD signing key would be able to install persistent malware that could not be eradicated without an external flasher and a known good PSP image. Furthermore, multiple security vulnerabilities have been demonstrated in AMD firmware in the past, and there is every reason to assume one or more zero day vulnerabilities are lurking in the PSP firmware. Given the  ...\n Much like with the Intel Boot Guard (an application of the Intel Management Engine), AMD \u2019s PSP can also act as a tyrant by checking signatures on any boot firmware that you flash, making replacement boot firmware (e.g. libreboot, coreboot) impossible on some boards. Early anecdotal reports indicate that AMD \u2019s boot guard counterpart will be used on most OEM hardware, disabled only on so-called \u201centhusiast  ...\n    Handles some power management for PCIe devices (without this, your laptop will not work properly) and several other power management related features.\n The firmware is signed, although on older AMD hardware it is a symmetric key, which means that with access to the key (if leaked) you could sign your own modified version and run it. Rudolf Marek (coreboot hacker) found out how to extract this key  in this video demonstration, and based on this work, Damien Zammit (another coreboot hacker)  partially replaced itwith free firmware, but on the relevant system  ...\n  This is responsible for virtually all core hardware initialization on modern AMD systems. In 2011, AMD started cooperating with the coreboot project, releasing this as source code under a free license. In 2014, they stopped releasing source code and started releasing AGESA as binary blobs instead. This makes AGESA now equivalent to  Intel FSP.\n  Read the Intel section practically the same, though it was found with much later hardware in AMD that you could run without microcode updates. It\u2019s unknown whether the updates are needed on all AMD boards (depends on CPU).\n  AMD seemed like it was on the right track in 2011 when it started cooperating with and releasing source code for several critical components to the coreboot project. It was not to be. For so-called economic reasons, they decided that it was not worth the time to invest in the coreboot project anymore.\n For a company to go from being so good, to so bad, in just 3 years, shows that something is seriously wrong with AMD. Like Intel, they do not deserve your money.\n Given the current state of Intel hardware with the Management Engine, it is our opinion that all performant x86 hardware newer than the AMD Family 15h CPUs (on AMD \u2019s side) or anything post-2009 on Intel \u2019s side is defective by design and cannot safely be used to store, transmit, or process sensitive data. Sensitive data is any data in which a data breach would cause significant economic harm to  ...\n  Libreboot has support for fam15h AMD hardware (~2012 gen) and some older Intel platforms like Napa, Montevina, Eagle Lake, Lakeport (2004-2006). We also have support for some ARM chipsets (rk3288). On the Intel side, we\u2019re also interested in some of the chipsets that use Atom CPUs (rebranded from older chipsets, mostly using ich7-based southbridges).\n  Short answer: yes. These laptops also have an Intel GPU inside, which libreboot uses. The ATI GPU is ignored by libreboot.\n These laptops use what is called  switchable graphics, where it will have both an Intel and ATI GPU. Coreboot will allow you to set (using nvramtool) a parameter, specifying whether you would like to use Intel or ATI. The ATI GPU lacks free native graphics initialization in coreboot, unlike the Intel GPU.\n Libreboot modifies coreboot, in such a way where this nvramtool setting is ignored. Libreboot will just assume that you want to use the Intel GPU. Therefore, the ATI GPU is completely disabled on these laptops. Intel is used instead, with the free native graphics initialization (VBIOS replacement) that exists in coreboot.\n   A common issue with desktop hardware is the Video BIOS, when no onboard video is present, since every video card has a different Video BIOS. Onboard GPUs also require one, so those still have to be replaced with free software (non-trivial task). Libreboot has to initialize the graphics chipset, but most graphics cards lack a free Video BIOS for this purpose. Some desktop motherboards supported  ...\n  Most likely not. First, you must consult coreboot\u2019s own hardware compatibility list at  http://www.coreboot.org/Supported_Motherboardsand, if it is supported, check whether it can run without any proprietary blobs in the ROM image. If it can: wonderful! Libreboot can support it, and you can add support for it. If not, then you will need to figure out how to reverse engineer and replace (or remove)  ...\n For those systems where no coreboot support exists, you must first port it to coreboot and, if it can then run without any blobs in the ROM image, it can be added to libreboot. See:  Motherboard Porting Guide (this is just the tip of the iceberg!)\n Please note that board development should be done upstream (in coreboot) and merged downstream (into libreboot). This is the correct way to do it, and it is how the libreboot project is coordinated so as to avoid too much forking of the coreboot source code.\n  Libreboot has support for some ARM based laptops, using the  Rockchip RK3288 SoC. Check the libreboot  hardware compatibility list, for more information.\n      It\u2019s possible to use a 16-pin SOIC test clip on an 8-pin SOIC chip, if you align the pins properly. The connection is generally more sturdy.\n  If you are using the GRUB payload, you can add a username and password (salted, hashed) to your GRUB configuration that resides inside the flash chip. The following guides (which also cover full disk encryption, including the /boot/ directory) show how to set a boot password in GRUB:  (Installing Debian or Devuan with FDE) and  (Installing Parabola or Arch GNU+Linux-Libre, with FDE)\n  By default, there is no write-protection on a libreboot system. This is for usability reasons, because most people do not have easy access to an external programmer for re-flashing their firmware, or they find it inconvenient to use an external programmer.\n On some systems, it is possible to write-protect the firmware, such that it is rendered read-only at the OS level (external flashing is still possible, using dedicated hardware). For example, on current GM45 laptops (e.g.\u00a0ThinkPad X200, T400), you can write-protect (see  ICH9 gen utility).\n It\u2019s possible to write-protect on all libreboot systems, but the instructions need to be written. The documentation is in the main git repository, so you are welcome to submit patches adding these instructions.\n  Libreboot actually uses the  GRUB payload. More information about payloads can be found at  coreboot.org/Payloads.\n Libreboot inherits the modular payload concept from coreboot, which means that pre-OS bare-metal  BIOS setup programs are not very practical. Coreboot (and libreboot) does include a utility called  nvramtool, which can be used to change some settings. You can find nvramtool under  coreboot/util/nvramtool/, in the libreboot source archives.\n The  -a option in nvramtool will list the available options, and  -w can be used to change them. Consult the nvramtool documentation on the coreboot wiki for more information.\n In practise, you don\u2019t need to change any of those settings, in most cases.\n Libreboot locks the CMOS table, to ensure consistent functionality for all users. You can use:\n  This will change the default inside that ROM image, and then you can re-flash it.\n  Libreboot integrates the GRUB bootloader already, as a   payload. This means that the GRUB bootloader is actually  flashed, as part of the boot firmware (libreboot). This means that you do not have to install a boot loader on the HDD or SSD, when installing a new distribution. You\u2019ll be able to boot just fine, using the bootloader (GRUB) that is in the flash chip.\n This also means that even if you remove the HDD or SSD, you\u2019ll still have a functioning bootloader installed which could be used to boot a live distribution installer from a USB flash drive. See  How to install GNU+Linux on a libreboot system\n  Not anymore. Recent versions of libreboot (using the GRUB payload) will automatically switch to a GRUB configuration on the HDD or SSD, if it exists. You can also load a different GRUB configuration, from any kind of device that is supported in GRUB (such as a USB flash drive). For more information, see  Modifying the GRUB Configuration in Libreboot Systems\n           The main freedom issue on any system, is the boot firmware (usually referred to as a BIOS or UEFI). Libreboot replaces the boot firmware with fully free code, but even with libreboot, there may still be other hardware components in the system (e.g. laptop) that run their own dedicated firmware, sometimes proprietary. These are on secondary processors, where the firmware is  ...\n Note that these issues are not unique to libreboot systems. They apply universally, to most systems. The issues described below are the most common (or otherwise critical).\n   The Video BIOS is present on most video cards. For integrated graphics, the VBIOS (special kind of OptionROM) is usually embedded in the main boot firmware. For external graphics, the VBIOS is usually on the graphics card itself. This is usually proprietary; the only difference is that SeaBIOS can execute it (alternatively, you embed it in a coreboot ROM image and have coreboot  ...\n On current libreboot systems, instead of VBIOS, coreboot native GPU init is used, which is currently only implemented for Intel GPUs. Other cards with proper KMS drivers can be initialized once Linux boots, but copy of VBIOS may be still needed to fetch proper VRAM frequency and other similar parameters (without executing VBIOS code).\n In configurations where SeaBIOS and native GPU init are used together, a special shim VBIOS is added that uses coreboot linear framebuffer.\n  Most (all?) laptops have this. The EC (embedded controller) is a small, separate processor that basically processes inputs/outputs that are specific to laptops. For example:\n When you flick the radio on/off switch, the EC will enable/disable the wireless devices (wifi, bluetooth, etc) and enable/disable an LED that indicates whether it\u2019s turned on or not\n Listen to another chip that produces temperature readings, adjusting fan speeds accordingly (or turning the fan(s) on/off).\n Alexander Couzens from coreboot (lynxis on coreboot IRC) is working on a free EC firmware replacement for the ThinkPads that are supported in libreboot. See:  https://github.com/lynxis/h8s-ec (not ready yet).\n Most (all?) chromebooks have free EC firmware. Libreboot is currently looking into supporting a few ARM-based chromebooks.\n EC is present on nearly all laptops. Other devices use, depending on complexity, either EC or variant with firmware in Mask ROM - SuperIO.\n  HDDs and SSDs have firmware in them, intended to handle the internal workings of the device while exposing a simple, standard interface (such as AHCI/SATA) that the OS software can use, generically. This firmware is transparent to the user of the drive.\n HDDs and SSDs are quite complex, and these days contain quite complex hardware which is even capable of running an entire operating system (by this, we mean that the drive itself is capable of running its own embedded OS), even GNU+Linux or BusyBox/Linux.\n SSDs and HDDs are a special case, since they are persistent storage devices as well as computers.\n Example attack that malicious firmware could do: substitute your SSH keys, allowing unauthorized remote access by an unknown adversary. Or maybe substitute your GPG keys. SATA drives can also have DMA (through the controller), which means that they could read from system memory; the drive can have its own hidden storage, theoretically, where it could read your  ...\n With proper IOMMU and use of USB instead of SATA, it might be possible to mitigate any DMA-related issues that could arise.\n  Viable free replacement firmware is currently unknown to exist. For SSDs, the  OpenSSD project may be interesting.\n Apparently, SATA drives themselves don\u2019t have DMA but can make use of it through the controller. This  http://www.lttconn.com/res/lttconn/pdres/201005/20100521170123066.pdf (pages 388-414, 420-421, 427, 446-465, 492-522, 631-638) and this  http://www.intel.co.uk/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/technical-specifications/serial-ata-ahci-spec-rev1_3.pdf(pages  ...\n The following is based on discussion with Peter Stuge (CareBear\\) in the coreboot IRC channel on Friday, 18 September 2015, when investigating whether the SATA drive itself can make use of DMA. The following is based on the datasheets linked above:\n According to those linked documents, FIS type 39h is  \u201cDMA Activate FIS - Device to Host\u201d. It mentions  \u201ctransfer of data from the host to the device, and goes on to say: Upon receiving a DMA Activate, if the host adapter \u2019s DMA controller has been programmed and armed, the host adapter shall initiate the transmission of a Data FIS and shall transmit in this  ...\n Based on this, it\u2019s safe to say that use of USB instead of SATA is advisable if security is a concern. USB 2.0 has plenty of bandwidth for many HDDs (a few high-end ones can use more bandwidth than USB 2.0 is capable of), but for SSDs it might be problematic (unless you\u2019re using USB 3.0, which is not yet usable in freedom. See\n Use of USB is also not an absolute guarantee of safety, so do beware. The attack surface becomes much smaller, but a malicious drive could still attempt a \u201cfuzzing \u201dattack (e.g. sending malformed USB descriptors, which is how the tyrant DRM on the Playstation 3 was broken, so that users could run their own operating system and run unsigned code). (you \u2019 ...\n   It is recommended that you use full disk encryption, on HDDs connected via USB. There are several adapters available online, that allow you to connect SATA HDDs via USB. Libreboot documents how to install several distributions with full disk encryption. You can adapt these for use with USB drives:\n  The current theory (unproven) is that this will at least prevent malicious drives from wrongly manipulating data being read from or written to the drive, since it can \u2019t access your LUKS key if it \u2019s only ever in RAM, provided that the HDD doesn \u2019t have DMA (USB devices don \u2019t have DMA). The worst that it could do in this case is destroy your data. Of  ...\n  Ethernet NICs will typically run firmware inside, which is responsible for initializing the device internally. Theoretically, it could be configured to drop packets, or even modify them.\n With proper IOMMU, it might be possible to mitigate the DMA-related issues. A USB NIC can also be used, which does not have DMA.\n  Implements an instruction set. See description. Here we mean microcode built in to the CPU. We are not talking about the updates supplied by the boot firmware (libreboot does not include microcode updates, and only supports systems that will work without it) Microcode can be very powerful. No proof that it\u2019s malicious, but it could theoretically\n There isn\u2019t really a way to solve this, unless you use a CPU which does not have microcode. (ARM CPUs don\u2019t, but most ARM systems require blobs for the graphics hardware at present, and typically have other things like soldered wifi which might require blobs)\n CPUs often on modern systems have a processor inside it for things like power management. ARM for example, has lots of these.\n  Sound hardware (integrated or discrete) typically has firmware on it (DSP) for processing input/output. Again, a USB DAC is a good workaround.\n  Webcams have firmware integrated into them that process the image input into the camera; adjusting focus, white balancing and so on. Can use USB webcam hardware, to work around potential DMA issues; integrated webcams (on laptops, for instance) are discouraged by the libreboot project.\n  Doesn\u2019t really apply to current libreboot systems (none of them have USB 3.0 at the moment), but USB 3.0 host controllers typically rely on firmware to implement the XHCI specification. Some newer coreboot ports also require this blob, if you want to use USB 3.0.\n This doesn\u2019t affect libreboot at the moment, because all current systems that are supported only have older versions of USB available. USB devices also don\u2019t have DMA (but the USB host controller itself does).\n With proper IOMMU, it might be possible to mitigate the DMA-related issues (with the host controller).\n  Some laptops might have a simcard reader in them, with a card for handling WWAN, connecting to a 3g/4g (e.g.\u00a0GSM) network. This is the same technology used in mobile phones, for remote network access (e.g.\u00a0internet).\n NOTE: not to be confused with wifi. Wifi is a different technology, and entirely unrelated.\n The baseband processor inside the WWAN chip will have its own embedded operating system, most likely proprietary. Use of this technology also implies the same privacy issues as with mobile phones (remote tracking by the GSM network, by triangulating the signal).\n On some laptops, these cards use USB (internally), so won \u2019t have DMA, but it \u2019s still a massive freedom and privacy issue. If you have an internal WWAN chip/card, the libreboot project recommends that you disable and (ideally, if possible) physically remove the hardware. If you absolutely must use this technology, an external USB dongle  ...\n Use of ethernet or wifi is recommended, as opposed to mobile networks, as these are generally much safer.\n On all current libreboot laptops, it is possible to remove the WWAN card and sim card if it exists. The WWAN card is next to the wifi card, and the sim card (if installed) will be in a slot underneath the battery, or next to the RAM.\n   Absolutely! It is well-tested in libreboot, and highly recommended. See  installing GNU+Linux and  booting GNU+Linux.\n Any recent distribution should work, as long as it uses KMS (kernel mode setting) for the graphics.\n  On Fedora, by default the grub.cfg tries to boot linux in 16-bit mode. You just have to modify Fedora\u2019s GRUB configuration. Refer to  the GNU+Linux page.\n       Libreboot on all devices only provides host hardware init firmware images, that can be written 25XX SPI NOR Flash. But on many systems there are a lot more computers running blob firmware. Some of them are not practicable to replace due to being located on Mask ROM. Some devices have EC firmware being build as well. Additionally, besides  ...\n Notable proprietary blobs (not a complete list): * All devices * SATA/PATA Hard Drive/Optical Disc Drive Firmware ( often contain powerful ARM based computer) * Pendrives and any USB peripherals - they contain a computer with code running to at the very least handle the USB protocol * ThinkPads: * EC Firmware (H8S until including Sandy  ...\n  Basics of soldering and rework by PACE Both series of videos are mandatory regardless of your soldering skill.\n edX course on basics of electronics In most countries contents of this course is covered during middle and high school.

"note_en": "A recent post by  Hillel Wayneabout influential dead languages (well, mostly dead, he notes) has reminded me that there is a lot about APL that people do not know, and with the obscurity of APL in the wide world of programming, one must be forgiven for thinking of APL in terms of a dead (mostly) language. But this question comes up so much that I think it is worthwhile to examine APL in this light and clarify the understanding of APL in the modern world. Let us examine this question in three parts:  ...\n  What makes for a dead language? In short, lack of life. But how does this apply to programming languages? The proxy measures of popularity and userbase can help us, because popular languages are never dead. The reason for this is that the languages with many developers and users are almost always evolving and inventing new features, code, and interfaces. They maintain their connection to modern devices and interfaces. Nonetheless, popularity is not everything. After all, Haskell spent years  ...\n Life is creation and movement and potential. A language dies when it ceases to provide value in these dimensions. In other words, when a language no longer has anything to contribute, when it is no longer suitable for creating new ideas, when it no longer keeps pace with the needs of the user, it dies.\n Languages that maintain usability while embedding unique or innovative models of thinking and problem solving are much more resilient to losses in popularity. Indeed, most new languages rise from obscurity precisely because of a unique combination of usability and newness/innovation in some way that matters. But languages like APL are a great example of how even great languages may lapse into obscurity due to market forces and failures to deliver value in the right niche. What is the maxim?  ...\n Often, a new language may die relatively quickly, as newness wears off and its essence is absorbed into other languages. The less fundamental uniqueness and value in a language, the faster a language can die. That&#39;s why we see so many languages that might be legacy still kicking in certain niches: their value is insanely high, or perceived to be so in those areas.\n  APL thrived in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s as an ultra-high productivity language for solving a problem rapidly and accurately. It gave access to the mainframes that others could not. Universities&#39; Computer Science departments actually found it too easy, and many departments embracing the software engineering model or formal methods model a la Dijkstra ran a heavy campaign against APL.\n During the 90&#39;s, the wave of Software Engineering, Personal Computers, and Object-oriented Programming (tm), swallowed up any alternatives. The APL vendors did not adequately respond and the fashion of the day meant that the user-focused, rapid development of APL became persona non grata in short order. The growing popularity of spreadsheets meant APL was fighting a two-front war and it lost ground (mindshare) quickly. Efforts such as J failed to achieve sufficient marketshare to turn  ...\n Despite this, APL continued to provide very high value to its existing customers, and Dyalog continued to invest not only in maintaining the language, but evolving and growing it to remain relevant and in many ways still ahead of the times (by about 20 years it seems). The result is a very solid language with some of the best tooling out there. The late great John Scholes introduced functional programming into the language at least a decade before anyone in mainstream programming (including  ...\n The willingness of the APL community to continue chasing what a &#34;tool of thought&#34; means in the fast-paced and practical world of business helped to insulate APL from too much fad programming. Ironically, it has also positioned APL in this decade to emerge like a phoenix from obscurity with a mature, fast, and experienced platform of tools and techniques for solving today&#39;s problems, because a few things happened while APL was &#34;away&#34; that changed the value proposition immensely.\n Not only has APL continued to evolve and improve over the years, the rest of the programming community has been learning lessons the hard way which only serve to make APL more relevant today than ever before.\n It turns out, OOP and software engineering are not the Godsends we thought them to be, particularly in the presence of rapid change. The compositional Lego block approach to programming has proven highly effective, both in functional programming as well as in the library-centric Python models. This was discussed years ago in MIT&#39;s famous shift away from its 6.001 curriculum of the day (decade?).\n We have also come to see the value of domain experts in the programming practice. Methods like the Agile Method and the like emphasize code and a close, efficient communication with the user of a system. The methods used in many APL shops have been using and mastering &#34;agile&#34; in very tough corporate conditions since long before it was a blip on the radar of &#34;hot&#34; terms. Not only is there a cohesive culture around it, APL is one of the only languages intentionally designed  ...\n We have also had some time to learn the pitfalls of super compilation and &#34;Super High-level Declarative Programming&#34; with the sometimes insane performance hits in these systems either in usability or runtime performance or, sometimes, both. A classic example is the now standard practice of in-memory data stores instead of using an RDBMS for everything. APL applications have been maximizing in-memory database systems and high-performance queries for decades now, and the out  ...\n In a post-Ruby on Rails, big data, data-driven world, it turns out that performance does matter, long term scalability matters, but productivity also matters a great deal. And for many, the lesson has been, you cannot have it all. But there is another element to this. In a world of Lego blocks, if you can be the block designer and builder, you have tremendous power and advantage compared to people who can only slap together the big blocks/components of others.\n When it comes to performance and productivity, no other general purpose language comes close nor has as many lessons in doing just that. This is because big picture performance gains matter most as long as you can manage the low-level performance. As I show in  my thesis, APL is uniquely capable of very high-level, direct solutions that are extremely concise, yet maintaining mechanical sympathy and near byte-level performance analysis. Because of changes in modern hardware, APL is  ...\n But what about those pesky symbols? Well, ask yourself what the trend in PL is these days. How many people embrace COBOL&#39;s keyword-heavy approach? We live in an international world full of non-English scripts. You know the closest thing to an international language we have? Math notation, and heavy on the symbols. APL is designed as executable math notation. Now that Unicode and modern fonts and operating systems make it possible to use and type any symbols we want, we need  ...\n Of course, it is not all sunshine and roses. The near death of APL in the 90&#39;s still weighs heavy on the community. Most users today are young enthusiasts or old greybeards, with precious little in the middle. It is still a small, albeit passionate (sometimes too passionate), community. Many of its users are simply not present in the Internet channels so precious and vital to the view of the world for many of us.\n Sometimes this is because they are under NDA&#39;s and cannot have a presence or talk about their work. Others simply have better things to do and would not bother. Still others may not love to share, but they do not stay connected with the broader community of programmers, because they are users of APL for their passion somewhere else, and they would not identify with the open-source Internet community of programming language polyglots.\n The end result is a severe iceberg effect for APL users that only compounds. Fortunately, things are looking up, with small user groups showing up throughout the world and places like the  APL Orchard providing a chance to hang out with a passionate subset of the community who enjoy helping new users.\n Still, APL is a small community no matter how you slice it, but do not let that deter you from joining it. APL&#39;s community is still largely human, so please reach out to someone at  Dyalog or  myself or  Adam at the APL Orchard with questions you may have and we can help answer your questions and point you to the right documentation.\n Is APL dead? Not anymore. Changes in modern hardware, business needs, development methods, and our understanding of programming makes APL in its modern state perhaps more relevant and viable than ever before.\n  Solutions in many programming domains are simple to express in direct APL without complex libraries and dependency hell.\n APL is mechanically sympathetic to modern GPU and CPU architectures, leading to fast code that does not need to be hard to read or write or port.\n Dyalog APL comes with extensive tooling, examples, documentation, integrations, visualization, debugging, ingest tools/functions, libraries, serialization, and platform support.\n Idiomatic APL admits automatic or near automatic complexity analysis and is performance predictable across many architectures.\n  APL idioms are often portable across domains, meaning that techniques and strategies you learn apply in more areas (versus a library approach that restricts how applicable a given function is).\n More concise APL enables reductions in boilerplate and a more holistic analysis of systems for better whole architecture optimization.\n  APL is a language designed from the ground up on principles aligned with &#34;agile&#34; styles of programming.\n APL programs can be fundamentally simpler and more transparent, leading to better understanding the problem and better solutions.\n APL enables the benefits of data flow, functional, Lego style programming without needing to resort to large and complex sets of black-box libraries that limit your freedom and understanding as well as restrict your cross-domain transfer.\n APL is particularly suited for innovative spaces where simply leveraging off the shelf solutions can lead to sub-optimal results, while APL can allow domain experts to iterate on novel and existing solutions together in a compositional way to address complex and even not-so-complex domains with aplomb.\n APL is easy to integrate into existing or new codebases through extensive integration support for REST, JSON, .NET, Python, C/C++, shared objects, TCP, CSV, Office, HTTP, Docker, COM, R, and many other interfaces.\n APL enables you to have a single codebase that is performance portable across both CPU and GPU architectures.\n Many more common tech stacks can be fully and directly implemented in pure APL without any libraries needs, such as high-performance in-memory database query systems; this results in less code and less complexity. Often, these direct expressions are as short or shorter than the library calls to the existing implementations.\n When it comes right down to it, APL offers a unique platform in Dyalog that can often deliver the trifecta of increased runtime performance and control while reducing long term maintenance costs and increasing developer productivity on the same codebase when compared to common platforms in vogue today. In my book, such a radically value-driven language is far from dead, it&#39;s back from a long hiatus and here to show the youngsters a thing or three.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 13:36:52", "tags":

"note_en": "(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (  BRKa.N) sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines in April, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company\u2019s annual meeting, saying \u201cthe world has changed\u201d for the aviation industry.\n  The conglomerate had held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines (  DAL.N), 10% of American Airlines Co (  AAL.O), 10% of Southwest Airlines Co (  LUV.N) and 9% of United Airlines (  UAL.O) at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings.\n The conglomerate was one of the largest individual holders in the four airlines and in 2016 disclosed it had begun investing in the four carriers after avoiding the sector for years.\n Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near collapse U.S. travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n U.S. airlines are cutting hundreds of thousands of flights, parking thousands of planes as U.S. travel demand has fallen by about 95% and there is no clear timetable for passengers to return to flights at pre-crisis levels.\n  \u201cWe made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cWe will not fund a company that \u2014 where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.\u201d\n Berkshire disclosed on April 3 it had sold about 18% of its Delta stake and 4% of its Southwest shares.\n Buffett said Berkshire had invested around $7 billion or $8 billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc (  AAL.O).\n \u201cWe did not take out anything like $7 or $8 billion and that was my mistake,\u201d Buffett said at the company\u2019s annual meeting which was livestreamed. \u201cI am the one who made the decision.\u201d\n  Delta said in a statement it was aware of the sale and has \u201ctremendous respect for Mr. Buffett and the Berkshire team.\u201d The airline added it remains \u201cconfident that the strengths that are core to Delta\u2019s business \u2013 our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability \u2013 will endure and position Delta to succeed.\u201d\n  \u201cIt is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up.... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,\u201d Buffett added.\n Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines. He did invest in USAir in 1989.\n \u201cIf a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down,\u201d Buffett wrote in his 2007 annual letter. \u201cInvestors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-03 13:14:18", "tags":

"note_en": "Modern webpages are complex, full-featured applications with really impressive designs, and there are a lot of people interested in learning to style these rich interfaces.\n The nice thing about the Web is that even if I\u2019m an inexperienced developer, it\u2019s really easy to stumble upon tons of interesting designs during my regular browsing sessions.\n And so let\u2019s say I come across this example from the Airbnb homepage, and I\u2019d like to replicate this booking form here.\n So one thing you can do is to search for tutorials on a websites like CSSTricks or Codrops.\n But it\u2019s often difficult to specify exactly what aspect of the design you\u2019d like a tutorial for.\n But the biggest problem is that tutorials are often  too simplistic and not exactly what we\u2019re looking for.\n Here\u2019s a toy example that I found when searching for tutorials. You can see right away that it doesn\u2019t quite match the aesthetics of the original, which is dissatisfying.\n The Airbnb example uses  display: table; to achieve a tabular layout without using a semantically-incorrect  &lt;table&gt; element.\n The toy example uses floats and clearfix, which is a pretty outdated approach to layout.\n Now experts know this, so they often use the \u201cInspect Element\u201d feature built into modern browser devtools to inspect the underlying implementation.\n how other webpages implement effects using modern development best practices that tutorials don\u2019t always convey.\n  what exactly novices find challenging about inspecting production webpage CSS, and what that implies for the design of inspection tools\n I\u2019ll walk you through Ply, the tool we built to address these challenges\n and demonstrate how it helped novices replicate a complex design 50% more quickly and learn new concepts\n Surveyed 20 undergrad web devs about their experiences learning web development, using tutorials, and inspecting professional examples\n Followed up with 10 of them for an in-person study, during which they replicated web features on professional webpages using CDT\n Novices rely on  visual intuition, but existing inspection tools do not support reasoning visually about unfamiliar code.\n In line with  Gross and Kelleher (2010),  Brandt et al. (2010),  Ko, Myers, and Aung (2004)\n Our high-level finding was that novices rely heavily on their visual intuition to comprehend unfamiliar CSS, and struggle to relate visual outcomes to responsible lines of code.\n This is consistent with prior work that end user programmers struggle to identify the lines of code responsible for graphical outputs of interest.\n In particular, I want to talk about two core obstacles we identified in the context of CSS inspection.\n  So first, if you\u2019ve used Chrome DevTools you probably know that you can click a property to toggle it on and off, live on the page.\n The problem is that even though Chrome crosses off properties that it knows are inactive, there are  still properties left that can be toggled without changing the page\u2019s appearance.\n This would be fine if it were only one or two, but tragically, there are a lot \u2013 the red highlights are properties that are visually ineffective but appear relevant in Chrome \u2013 and you can see that it\u2019s pushed the relevant properties in green to the bottom of the fold.\n As we observed in needfinding, when relevant code was pushed below the fold, it was hard for novices to find\n But even if you removed these it\u2019s not enough \u2013 we also found in needfinding that novices lacked conceptual knowledge that prevented them from making sense of unfamiliar example code.\n In particular, novices struggled to understand how multiple properties work together to produce visual outcomes.\n one thing that people struggled with is understanding when multiple properties worked together to produce a visual effect\n So what we\u2019re seeing is that there\u2019s a gap between novices\u2019 approach to sense-making and how developer tools are currently designed.\n   So we build on their guidelines to propose new design guidelines for learner-friendly web inspectors.\n  Hide visually-irrelevant code from inspector output to minimize information overload and support novices\u2019 visual approach to sense-making\n Embed contextual guidance into inspector output to explain how CSS properties coordinate to produce visual effects.\n   Use representations and language that bridge learners\u2019 understanding (which in our case is visual intuition)\n           Our approach is inspired by a technique called visual regression testing, which is unrelated to statistical regression.\n     This seems like simple visual comparisons, but it allows us to help a novice understand the example by surfacing the conceptual knowledge about relationships between properties that they didn\u2019t know beforehand.\n      Following standard measures of learning gain, we asked participants to perform a similar task before and after performing the intervention so we could track the change in their understanding.\n  \u201cSomething about  z-index would change as a result of  position not being fixed.  position: fixed; is  doing something beyond pinning in place while you scroll.\u201d\n TODO: What\u2019s more exciting is that they could explain why this was happening", "posttime": "2020-05-03 12:08:24", "tags": "\u53ef\u89c6\u5316,web,visual", "title": "PLY\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684Web\u68c0\u67e5\u5668", "title_en": "Ply: A Visual Web Inspector", "transed": 1, "url": "https://slim.computer/ply-uist-2018/#/title-slide", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u53ef\u89c6\u5316", "web", "visual"]}]
