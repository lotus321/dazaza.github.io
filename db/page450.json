"note_en": "I played with the  web audio API for the first time recently, so I thought I&#39;d write up what I learned. I think that&#39;s my job or something.\n  The simplest demonstrable thing we can do with web audio is &#34;play a sound&#34;. But to do that, we first we need to load &amp; decode something:\n // The context is connected to the device speakers. // You only need one of these per document. const  context  =  new  AudioContext (); // Fetch the file fetch ( &#39;sound.mp4&#39; )  // Read it into memory as an arrayBuffer  . then ( response  =&gt;  response . arrayBuffer ())  // Turn it from mp3/aac/whatever into raw audio data  . then ( arrayBuffer  =&gt;  context . decodeAudioData ( arrayBuffer ))  . then ( audioBuffer  =&gt;  {  // Now we&#39;re ready to play!  });\n Unfortunately we need to work around a few things in Safari. We need to use  webkitAudioContext - Safari doesn&#39;t support the unprefixed version. It doesn&#39;t support  fetch yet (it&#39;s  in development) so we&#39;ll  need to use XHR). And  decodeAudioData doesn&#39;t support promises, so we&#39;ll  need to polyfill that.\n  // Create a source: // This represents a playback head. const  source  =  context . createBufferSource (); // Give it the audio data we loaded: source . buffer  =  audioBuffer ; // Plug it into the output: source . connect ( context . destination ); // And off we go! source . start ();\n   So yeah, it&#39;s way more complicated than just using  &lt;audio src=&#34;\u2026&#34;&gt; to play a sound, but web audio can do so much more. The amount of control web audio gives you is great fun, but also kinda daunting. In this post I&#39;m just going to scratch the surface, and look at how to loop and queue sounds.\n    We tried to make it as ridiculous as possible, and the music was a big part of that. The music was produced by  Plan8, and it only took them a day to compose (we misread the licence on a piece of music we were going to use, so the deadline was  our fault. Anyway, the music they made is way better). They also have JS libraries for scheduling audio, but hey I was in the mood for some procrastination, so I did it myself.\n  The music in the Big Web Quiz has three phases, and we wanted to switch between them during questions. Using the code above, I loaded three buffers,  phase1AudioBuffer,  phase2AudioBuffer, and  stabAudioBuffer, each representing a different phase of Big Web Quiz&#39;s music.\n A naive solution is to play phase 1, then later stop it and play phase 2:\n const  phase1Source  =  context . createBufferSource (); phase1Source . buffer  =  phase1AudioBuffer ; phase1Source . connect ( context . destination ); phase1Source . start (); // Then later\u2026 const  phase2Source  =  context . createBufferSource (); phase2Source . buffer  =  phase2AudioBuffer ; phase2Source . connect ( context . destination ); // Stop phase 1 phase1Source . stop (); // Start phase 2 phase2Source . start ();\n    Even though we have our audio data loaded in memory, there&#39;s still a gap between us calling  start() and the audio actually playing.\n This is fine if you want the sound to play as soon as possible and don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s a few milliseconds out, such as playing a sound in a game when the player collects a coin, but when syncronising two clips things need to be precise.\n To do anything precise with audio, you need to schedule things in advance. Both  start and  stop take an optional number, the time to actually start/stop, and  context.currentTime gives you the current time as far as the audio context is concerned.\n How much advance notice you have to give depends on hardware, but  Chris Wilson reliably informs me that a quarter of a second is super-safe more-than-enough, even for slow hardware.\n   A quarter of a second is a long delay, but in this case syncronisation is more important to us than immediacy.\n Note: In the web audio API, time is in seconds, whereas most other web APIs use milliseconds.\n   Encoding audio down to formats like MP3 or AAC is a lossy process, but you at least get to pick the encoder. When you use  decodeAudioData you&#39;re relying on whatever decoder the browser uses, and this may come as a shock, but sometimes different browsers do things differently.\n   The original clip is gapless at the start/end, but if you&#39;re in Chrome stable, Firefox, or Edge, you&#39;ll see a huge gap. By huge I mean 45 milliseconds, but y&#39;know, that&#39;s a big deal when we&#39;re trying to instantly switch between two clips.\n The gap is almost gone in Chrome Canary. Safari on the other hand gets it spot-on, no gap at all.\n In the first draft of this article I congratulated Safari on a job well done, but actual expert  Paul Adenot from Mozilla dropped a few knowledge bombs on me (in a friendly way of course).\n The gap at the start is specified by the encoder as metadata. From  Apple&#39;s documentation:\n \u2026encoders add at least 1024 samples of silence before the first \u2018true\u2019 audio sample, and often add more. This is called variously \u201cpriming\u201d, \u201cpriming samples\u201d, or \u201cencoder delay\u201d\u2026\n Therefore, a playback system must trim the silent priming samples to preserve correct synchronization. This trimming by the playback system should be done in two places:\n When the playback position is moved to another location. For example, the user skips ahead or back to another part of the media and begins playback from that new location.\n The question is, should the browser remove the &#34;priming samples&#34; as part of  decodeAudioData, or are we (as users of the web audio API) the &#34;playback system&#34;, meaning we have to deal with it.\n I still feel that Safari is doing the right thing here, especially as finding out the number of priming samples from the metadata is really non-trivial. To try and bring some consistency here,  I&#39;ve filed an issue with the spec.\n In the meantime, we can work around the gap by finding out how long it is:\n function  findStartGapDuration ( audioBuffer )  {  // Get the raw audio data for the left &amp; right channels.  const  l  =  audioBuffer . getChannelData ( 0 );  const  r  =  audioBuffer . getChannelData ( 1 );  // Each is an array of numbers between -1 and 1 describing  // the waveform, sample by sample.  // Now to figure out how long both channels remain at 0:  for  ( let  i  =  0 ;  i  &lt;  l . length ;  i ++ )  {  if  ( l [ i ]  ||  r [ i ])  {  // Now we know which sample is non-zero, but we want  // the gap in seconds,  ...\n Once we have the gap, we can use source&#39;s second parameter to start playback at that point, after the silence:\n const  phase1StartGap  =  findStartGapDuration ( phase1AudioBuffer ); const  phase1Source  =  context . createBufferSource (); phase1Source . buffer  =  phase1AudioBuffer ; phase1Source . connect ( context . destination ); // Cater for the gap: phase1Source . start ( context . currentTime  +  safetyBuffer ,  phase1StartGap ); // Then later\u2026 const  phase2StartGap  =  findStartGapDuration ( phase2AudioBuffer ); const  phase2Source  =  context . createBufferSource (); phase2Source . buffer  =  phase2AudioBuffer ; phase2Source . connect  ...\n   Better, but not perfect. Depending on when you press the button, the switch from phase 2 to the end stab can feel mistimed, but we can fix that\u2026\n  Ideally we want the phases to switch right at the end of a musical bar. Phase 1 is 110bpm, and phase 2 is 123bpm, so we can figure out the duration of each bar:\n function  getBarDuration ( bpm ,  beatsPerBar )  {  return  60  /  bpm  *  beatsPerBar ; } const  phase1BarDuration  =  getBarDuration ( 110 ,  4 );  const  phase2BarDuration  =  getBarDuration ( 123 ,  4 );\n We want to switch the phases at the end of the next bar, unless that&#39;s less than our  safetyBuffer, in which case we want to switch at the end of the following bar.\n function  getPhaseSwitchTime ( currentTime ,  phaseStartTime ,  barDuration )  {  // How long the phase has been playing:  const  phasePlaybackPosition  =  currentTime  -  phaseStartTime ;  // How long has it been playing the current bar:  const  positionWithinBar  =  phasePlaybackPosition  %  barDuration ;  // How long until the next bar:  let  untilSwitch  =  barDuration  -  positionWithinBar ;  // If it&#39;s less than our safetyBuffer, add another bar:  if  ( untilSwitch  &lt;  safetyBuffer )  untilSwitch  ...\n Unfortunately the web audio API doesn&#39;t tell us the current playblack position of a source ( it might eventually), so we have to track that ourselves:\n const  phase1StartTime  =  context . currentTime  +  safetyBuffer ;  phase1Source . start ( phase1StartTime ,  phase1StartGap ); // Then later\u2026 const  phase2StartTime  =  getPhaseSwitchTime ( context . currentTime ,  phase1StartTime ,  phase1BarDuration ); phase1Source . stop ( phase2StartTime ); phase2Source . start ( phase2StartTime ,  phase2StartGap );\n   Sometimes switching between clips can cause a click if the samples don&#39;t join at a zero value. If you get this, you can use a  gain node to create a really short, imperceptible, fade-out and fade-in.\n     This is a single source that loops, but the loop-points change dynamically. Compared to what we&#39;ve done already, looping a clip is pretty simple:\n // Cater for buggy AAC decoders as before: const  sonicStartGap  =  findStartGapDuration ( sonicAudioBuffer ); // Create the source: const  sonicSource  =  context . createBufferSource (); sonicSource . buffer  =  sonicAudioBuffer ; sonicSource . connect ( context . destination ); // Loop it! sonicSource . loop  =  true ; // Set loop points: sonicSource . loopStart  =  loopStartTime  +  sonicStartGap ; sonicSource . loopEnd  =  loopEndTime  +  sonicStartGap ; // Play! sonicSource . start ( 0 ,  sonicStartGap );\n     Tools like  Audacity (free) and  Adobe Audition (not so free) are great for chopping and looping audio.\n Once we&#39;ve found the loop points, we need to find the  sample they start &amp; end on. This is the most accurate measurement we&#39;ll get.\n  const  loopPoints  =  [  { start :  328948 ,  end :  656828 },  { start :  985007 ,  end :  1314119 },  { start :  1643272 ,  end :  1972421 },  { start :  1972421 ,  end :  2137288 }, ];\n  const  loopPointTimes  =  loopPoints . map ( loop  =&gt;  ({  start :  loop . start  /  48000  +  sonicStartGap ,  end :  loop . end  /  48000  +  sonicStartGap }));\n 48000 needs to be replaced with the sample rate of the clip as viewed in Audacity. Don&#39;t do what I did &amp; use  buffer.sampleRate, as the decoded sample rate can be different to the sample rate of the file. Audio is decoded to  context.sampleRate, which is 44,100 on my mac, but 48,000 on my phone.\n  At the end of the demo above, the clip loops back to an earlier point. Unfortunately, if you set  loopEnd to a point earlier than the current playback point, it immediately goes back to  loopStart, whereas we want it to play through to the end,  then go back to an earlier loop.\n The least hacky way to do this would be to stop  sonicSource looping, and queue up a new  sonicSource2 to start looping once  sonicSource reaches its natural finish.\n However, to do this, we&#39;d need to know the current playback position of  sonicSource, and as I mentioned earlier, this  feature hasn&#39;t landed yet. We can&#39;t even reliably work around this - the source has been looping all over the place, and we can&#39;t be sure each write to  loopStart and  loopEnd made it to the sound card in time. I&#39;m hacking it for the purposes of the visualisations above, but it isn&#39;t accurate enough for sound.\n To work around this we make two changes to the loop. We loop from the start of the earlier loop, right to the end of the clip. Then, once the clip has played past the end, we change  loopEnd to the end of the earlier loop.\n // Current loop start const  currentLoopStart  =  sonicSource . loopStart ;  // The earlier loop we want to move to. const  targetLoop  =  loopPointTimes [ 1 ]; // The point we want to reach before looping back. // sonicSource.duration is not good enough here, due to // the AAC decoding bug mentioned earlier. const  endSample  =  658624 ; const  endTime  =  endSample  /  48000  +  sonicStartGap ; // Play to the end, then loop back to the start: sonicSource . loopStart  =  targetLoop . start  ...\n endTime - currentLoopStart is the maximum time the clip could play before it loops back to  targetLoop.start, after that it&#39;s safe to move the end point. Done!\n While the web audio API isn&#39;t something you&#39;ll use in every project, it&#39;s suprisingly powerful and fun. If you&#39;re wanting to dig a little deeper, I recommend this  multi-part guide by  Tero Parviainen.\n Speaking of procrastination, I really should be getting back to the service worker spec\u2026",

"note_en": "Round 5 of Gitcoin Grants has just finished, with $250,000 of matching split between tech, media, and the new (non-Ethereum-centric) category of &#34;public health&#34;. In general, it seems like the mechanism and the community are settling down into a regular rhythm. People know what it means to contribute, people know what to expect, and the results emerge in a relatively predictable pattern - even if which specific grants get the most funds is not so easy to predict.\n       So let&#39;s go straight into the analysis. One important property worth looking at is stability of income across rounds: do projects that do well in round N also tend to do well in round N+1? Stability of income is very important if we want to support an ecosystem of &#34;quadratic freelancers&#34;: we want people to feel comfortable relying on their income knowing that it will not completely disappear the next round. On the other hand, it would be harmful if some recipients became completely  ...\n     Week in Ethereum had the highest total amount received in both  the previous round and the current round. EthHub and Bankless are also near the top in both the current round and the previous round. On the other hand, Antiprosynthesis, the (beloved? notorious? famous?) Twitter info-warrior, has decreased from $13,813 to $5,350, while  Chris Blec&#39;s YouTube channel has  increased from $5,851 to $12,803. So some churn, but also some continuity between rounds.\n On the tech side, we see much more churn in the winners, with a less clear relationship between income last round and income this round:\n    Last round, the winner was Tornado Cash, claiming $30,783; this round, they are down to $8,154. This round, the three roughly-even winners are  Samczsun ($4,631 contributions + $15,704 match = $20,335 total),  Arboreum ($16,084 contributions + $9,046 match = $25,128 total) and  1inch.exchange ($58,566 contributions + $7,893 match = $66,459 total), in the latter case the bulk coming from one contribution:\n     In the previous round, those three winners were not even in the top ten, and in some cases not even part of Gitcoin Grants at all.\n These numbers show us two things. First, large parts of the Gitcoin community seem to be in the mindset of treating grants not as a question of &#34;how much do you deserve for your last two months of work?&#34;, but rather as a one-off reward for years of contributions in the past. This was one of the strongest rebuttals that I received to my  criticism of Antiprosynthesis receiving $13,813 in the last round: that the people who contributed to that award did not see it as two months&#39;  ...\n That said, not everyone contributes in this way. For example, Prysm got $7,966 last round and $8,033 this round, and Week in Ethereum is consistently well-rewarded ($16,727 previous, $22,237 current), and EthHub saw less stability but still kept half its income ($13,515 previous, $6,705 current) even amid a 20% drop to the matching pool size as some funds were redirected to public health. So there definitely are some contributors that  aregetting almost a reasonable monthly salary  ...\n  One feature that was tested this round to try to improve stability was recurring contributions: users could choose to split their contribution among multiple rounds. However, the feature was not used often: out of over 8,000 total contributions, only 120 actually made recurring contributions. I can think of three possible explanations for this:\n People just don&#39;t want to give recurring contributions; they genuinely prefer to freshly rethink who they are supporting every round.\n People would be willing to give more recurring contributions, but there is some kind of &#34;market failure&#34; stopping them; that is, it&#39;s collectively optimal for everyone to give more recurring contributions, but it&#39;s not any individual contributor&#39;s interest to be the first to do so.\n In a recent call with the Gitcoin team, hypothesis (3) was mentioned frequently. A specific issue was that people were worried about making recurring contributions because they were concerned whether or not the money that they lock up for a recurring contribution would be safe. Improving the payment system and notification workflow may help with this. Another option is to move away from explicit &#34;streaming&#34; and instead simply have the UI provide an option for repeating  ...\n Hypothesis (1) also should be taken seriously; there&#39;s genuine value in preventing ossification and allowing space for new entrants. But I want to zoom in particularly on hypothesis (2), the coordination failure hypothesis.\n My explanation of hypothesis (2) starts, interestingly enough, with a defense of (1): why ossification is genuinely a risk. Suppose that there are two projects, A and B, and suppose that they are equal quality. But A already has an established base of contributors; B does not (we&#39;ll say for illustration it only has a few existing contributors). Here&#39;s how much matching you are contributing by participating in each project:\n    Clearly, you have more impact by supporting A, and so A gets even more contributors and B gets fewer; the rich get richer. Even if project B was  somewhat better, the greater impact from supporting A could still create a lock-in that reinforces A&#39;s position. The current everyone-starts-from-zero-in-each-round mechanism greatly limits this type of entrenchment, because, well, everyone&#39;s matching gets reset and starts from zero.\n However, a very similar effect also is the cause behind the market failure preventing stable recurring contributions, and the every-round-reset  actually exacerbates it. Look at the same picture above, except instead of thinking of A and B as  two different projects, think of them as  the same project in the current round and in the next round.\n We simplify the model as follows. An individual has two choices: contribute $10 in the current round, or contribute $5 in the current round and $5 in the next round. If the matchings in the two rounds were equal, then the latter option would actually be more favorable: because the matching is proportional to the square root of the donation size, the former might give you eg. a $200 match now, but the latter would give you $141 in the current round + $141 in the next round  ...\n    So there is a substantial region within which the bad equilibrium of everyone concentrating is sticky: if more than about 3/4 of contributors are expected to concentrate, it seems in your interest to also concentrate. A mathematically astute reader may note that there is  always some intermediate strategy that involves splitting but at a ratio different from 50/50, which you can prove performs better than either full concentrating  orthe even split, but here we get back  ...\n How might we fix this? One option is to add a bit of continuity to matching ratios: when computing pairwise matches, match against not just the current round&#39;s contributors but, say, 1/3 of the previous round&#39;s contributors as well:\n    This makes some philosophical sense: the objective of quadratic funding is to subsidize contributions to projects that are detected to be public goods because multiple people have contributed to them, and contributions in the previous round are certainly also evidence of a project&#39;s value, so why not reuse those? So here, moving away from everyone-starts-from-zero toward this partial carryover of matching ratios would mitigate the round concentration effect - but,  ...\n  This round also introduced negative contributions, a feature proposed in my  review of the previous round. But as with recurring contributions, very few people made negative contributions, to the point where their impact on the results was negligible. Also, there was  active  opposition to  negative  contributions:\n      The main source of opposition was basically what I predicted in the previous round. Adding a mechanism that allows people to penalize others, even if deservedly so, can have tricky and easily harmful social consequences. Some people even opposed the negative contribution mechanism to the point where they took care to give positive contributions to everyone who received a negative contribution.\n How do we respond? To me it seems clear that, in the long run,  somemechanism of filtering out bad projects, and ideally compensating for overexcitement into good projects, will have to exist. It doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be integrated as a symmetric part of the QF, but there does need to be a filter of some form. And this mechanism, whatever form it will take, invariably opens up the possibility of the same social dynamics. So there is a challenge that will  ...\n One approach would be to hide more information: instead of just hiding  whomade a negative contribution, outright hide the fact that a negative contribution was made. Many opponents of negative contributions explicitly indicated that they would be okay (or at least more okay) with such a model. And indeed (see the next section), this is a direction we will have to go anyway. But it would come at a cost - effectively hiding negative contributions would mean not  ...\n       It does seem clear that, at current scales, stronger protections against manipulation are goingto be required. The first thing that can be done is adding a stronger identity verification layer than Github accounts; this is something that the Gitcoin team is already working on. There is definitely a complex tradeoff between security and inclusiveness to be worked through, but it is not especially difficult to implement a first version. And if the identity problem  ...\n MACI is the solution that I proposed (and Barry Whitehat and co are implementing) to solve this problem. Essentially, MACI is a cryptographic construction that allows for contributions to projects to happen on-chain in a privacy-preserving, encrypted form, that allows anyone to cryptographically verify that the mechanism is being implemented  correctly, but prevents participants from being able to prove to a third party that they made any particular contribution.  ...\n However, we do need to think through some of the second-order consequences that integrating MACI would introduce. The biggest blessing, and curse, of using MACI is that contributions become hidden. Identities necessarily become hidden, but even the exact timing of contributions would need to be hidden to prevent deanonymization through timing (to prove that  youcontributed, make the total amount jump up between 17:40 and 17:42 today). Instead, for example,  ...\n The challenge with hiding contributions is that we lose the &#34;social proof&#34; motivator for contributing: if contributions are unprovable you can&#39;t as easily publicly brag about a contribution you made. My best proposal for solving this is for the mechanism to publish one extra number: the  totalamount that a particular participant contributed (counting only projects that have received at least 10 contributors to prevent inflating one&#39;s number  ...\n  All in all, Gitcoin Grants is establishing itself as a significant pillar of the Ethereum ecosystem that more and more projects are relying on for some or all of their support. While it has a relatively low amount of funding at present, and so inevitably underfunds almost everything it touches, we hope that over time we&#39;ll continue to see larger sources of funding for the matching pools appear. One option is  MEV auctions, another is that new or existing  ...\n    Additionally, this round saw Gitcoin Grants&#39; first foray into applications beyond Ethereum with the health section. There is growing interest in quadratic funding from local government bodies and other non-blockchain groups, and it would be very valuable to see quadratic funding more broadly deployed in such contexts. That said, there are unique challenges there too. First, there&#39;s issues around onboarding people who do not already have cryptocurrency.  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:06:36", "tags": "\u91d1\u5e01,grants,\u4eba\u4eec,contributions", "title":

business owner, you might be struggling to balance demands for online delivery, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n  These days, you need to serve customers where they are. But this can be challenging when delivery services are expensive and setting them up can be time-consuming.\n  HERE WeGo Deliver helps you start your own delivery routing quickly and efficiently, with no fees till the end of 2020.\n    Let our tool do the work for you. Drag and drop your orders into HERE WeGo Deliver as a CSV file or upload them from e-commerce platforms like Shopify and Weebly to calculate driver routes immediately.\n  Cut out the middleman and run your own deliveries. Our tool helps you plan ahead and make the most of your vehicle and driver capacity.\n  Dispatch delivery routes to your drivers easily. HERE WeGo Deliver calculates the quickest routes based on current traffic conditions to help them avoid delays on the road.\n  Sync your delivery routes with HERE WeGo, our navigation app \u2014 available across all platforms. Help drivers find each delivery stop with turn-by-turn voice navigation and offline access even when mobile signal is lost.\n  We are making HERE WeGo Deliver free through the end of 2020 to help retail businesses quickly adapt to the need to offer deliveries to their customers.\n    HERE WeGo Deliver accepts delivery jobs in CSV format.  An example template is available for download.\n  The file has fields for order ID, customer name, phone number, email, address, start and end times for the delivery window, service time (how long the delivery will take) and \u201cdemand\u201d (an estimate of size, weight, volume, etc.).\n You only need the address to create plans. The other fields are there to help you and your drivers keep track of information about the delivery jobs. You may refer to the template to see examples of how different delivery jobs might look.\n  You can create and modify CSV files in a spreadsheet editor like Microsoft Excel, Numbers, LibreOffice Calc, or Google Sheets.\n  Each tour can be separately exported and shared as a PDF run sheet or as an email you can send directly to your drivers.\n  Phone numbers that are included in the uploaded CSV file will be available and visible to drivers in the PDF version of the run sheet.\n    Yes, HERE WeGo is designed for use with your current workforce. HERE does not provide drivers or driver service recommendations.\n  HERE WeGo, used by HERE WeGo Deliver as a turn-by-turn navigation app, is available as a free download on Android in the Google Play Store and iOS in the App Store. For Huawei owners, it is also available via AppGallery.\n  Get in touch via the \u201cContact us\u201d link on the bottom right of the HERE WeGo Deliver page or send an email to  wegodeliver@here.com\n    We do not take traffic into account but use an approximation for the travel time and distance. However, the HERE WeGo mobile app uses traffic in routing, and provides ETAs based on current traffic conditions.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:06:32", "tags":

"note_en": "Omega-3, a fatty acid commonly found in fish oil, may have long-term neurodevelopmental effects that ultimately reduce antisocial and aggressive behavior problems in children, a new study suggests.\n At the forefront of a field known as &#34;neurocriminology,&#34; Adrian Raine of the University of Pennsylvania has long studied the interplay between biology and environment when it comes to antisocial and criminal behavior. With strong physiological evidence that disruption to the emotion-regulating parts of the brain can manifest in violent outbursts, impulsive decision-making and other behavioral traits associated with crime, much of Raine&#39;s research involves looking at biological  ...\n    A new study by Raine now suggests that omega-3, a fatty acid commonly found in fish oil, may have long-term neurodevelopmental effects that ultimately reduce antisocial and aggressive behavior problems in children.\n He is a Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor with appointments in the School of Arts &amp; Sciences and the Perelman School of Medicine.\n Along with Raine, the study featured Jill Portnoy a graduate student in the Department of Criminology, and Jianghong Liu, an associate professor in the Penn School of Nursing. They collaborated with Tashneem Mahoomed of Mauritius&#39; Joint Child Health Project and Joseph Hibbeln of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n  When Raine was a graduate student, he, his advisor and colleagues conducted a longitudinal study of children in the small island nation of Mauritius. The researchers tracked the development of children who had participated in an enrichment program as 3-year-olds and also the development of children who had not participated. This enrichment program had additional cognitive stimulation, physical exercise and nutritional enrichment. At 11 years, the participants showed a marked improvement  ...\n     Raine and his colleagues were interested in teasing apart the mechanisms behind this improvement. Other studies suggested the nutritional component was worth a closer look.\n &#34;We saw children who had poor nutritional status at age 3 were more antisocial and aggressive at 8, 11 and 17,&#34; Raine said. &#34;That made us look back at the intervention and see what stood out about the nutritional component. Part of the enrichment was that the children receiving an extra two and a half portions of fish a week.&#34;\n Other research at the time was beginning to show that omega-3 is critical to brain development and function.\n &#34;Omega-3 regulates neurotransmitters, enhances the life of a neuron and increases dendritic branching, but our bodies do not produce it. We can only get it from the environment,&#34; Raine said.\n Research on the neuroanatomy of violent criminals suggested this might be a place to intervene. Other brain-imaging researchers have shown that omega-3 supplementation increases the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region Raine found to have higher rates of damage or dysfunction in criminal offenders.\n     Raine&#39;s new study featured a randomized controlled trial where children would receive regular omega-3 supplements in the form of a juice drink. One hundred children, aged 8 to 16, would each receive a drink containing a gram of omega-3 once a day for six months, matched with 100 children who received the same drink without the supplement. The children and parents in both groups took a series of personality assessments and questionnaires at the start.\n After six months, the researchers administered a simple blood test to see if the children in the experimental group had higher levels of omega-3 than those in the controls. They also had both parents and children take the personality assessments. Six months after that, the researchers had parents and children take the assessment again to see if there were any lasting effects from the supplements.\n The assessments had parents rate their children on &#34;externalizing&#34; aggressive and antisocial behavior, such as getting into fights or lying, as well as &#34;internalizing&#34; behavior, such as depression, anxiety and withdrawal. Children were also asked to rate themselves on these traits.\n While the children&#39;s self-reports remained flat for both groups, the average rate of antisocial and aggressive behavior as described by the parents dropped in both groups by the six-month point. Critically, however, those rates returned to the baseline for the control group but remained lowered in the experimental group, at the 12-month point.\n &#34;Compared to the baseline at zero months,&#34; Raine said, &#34;both groups show improvement in both the externalizing and internalizing behavior problems after six months. That&#39;s the placebo effect.\n &#34;But what was particularly interesting was what was happening at 12 months. The control group returned to the baseline while the omega-3 group continued to go down. In the end, we saw a 42 percent reduction in scores on externalizing behavior and 62 percent reduction in internalizing behavior.&#34;\n At both the six- and 12-month check-ins, parents also answered questionnaires about their own behavioral traits. Surprisingly, parents also showed an improvement in their antisocial and aggressive behavior. This could be explained by the parents taking some of their child&#39;s supplement, or simply because of a positive response to their child&#39;s own behavioral improvement.\n The researchers caution that this is still preliminary work in uncovering the role nutrition plays in the link between brain development and antisocial behavior. The changes seen in the one-year period of the experiment may not last, and the results may not be generalizable outside the unique context of Mauritius.\n Beyond these caveats, however, there is reason to further examine omega-3&#39;s role as a potential early intervention for antisocial behavior.\n &#34;As a protective factor for reducing behavior problems in children,&#34; Liu said, &#34;nutrition is a promising option; it is relatively inexpensive and can be easy to manage.&#34;\n Follow-up studies will include longer-term surveillance of children&#39;s behavioral traits and will investigate why their self-reports did not match the parental reports.\n    Materials provided by   University of Pennsylvania.

weird happened on the oil market last week. For a few minutes on April 20, the price of a barrel went  negativefor the first time ever. The unprecedented collapse of prices is linked to the pandemic, which has caused people to stop doing oil-guzzling things like flying and driving. There \u2019s now so much extra petroleum on the market that the world is running out of places to put it. If you \u2019re an oil producer, it seems like the sensible thing to do in this situation would be to \u2026stop producing  ...\n On Friday, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia, the US, and others will begin scaling back their production by nearly 10 million barrels per day. They hope that this will help stabilize prices and take some pressure off of producers and refineries that are scrambling to find a place to store the excess. But the rollback isn \u2019t likely to be enough. Oil producers would have to reduce production by almost three times that amount to match the downturn in demand.  ...\n   The short answer is because temporarily closing or \u201cshutting in\u201d a well costs money\u2014and potentially  lotsof money. It \u2019s not just about the foregone revenue, which is less of a concern when prices are dipping into the negative. It \u2019s about what happens when the well is opened back up. \u201cShutting in a well is not especially difficult, \u201dsays Eric van Oort, a petroleum engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. It \u2019s mostly a matter of shutting off a master valve at the surface, much like turning  ...\n The US has been the largest producer of crude oil in the world for the past two years, and the vast majority is dredged up in Texas and on offshore derricks in the Gulf of Mexico. On land, most of America\u2019s crude is produced from shale reservoirs, which trap the oil in rocks with low permeability. To set it free, companies use a technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that opens cracks in rocks deep in the Earth by blasting them with water or gas.\n  Shut-ins are a normal part of oil production, but they are usually limited to a few wells at a time and mostly undertaken for repairs. Petroleum producers have known for decades that shale wells that have previously been shut in produce less oil when they \u2019re reopened, says John McLennan, an expert in geomechanics at the University of Utah Energy and Geoscience Institute. But the exact cause of the damage is often unclear. McLennan says that one of the most well-supported explanations is water  ...\n  A well typically taps into a mixture of oil and water. Both are pumped to the surface, but the water is treated as waste. When a well is shut in, the ratio of oil to water is recalibrated, since there\u2019s no longer a big pipe sucking on the fissures in the rock. Because the rock in shale wells isn\u2019t very permeable, water may accumulate in the fractures. When the well opens up again, it may end up producing more water than oil, because the accumulated H 2O impedes the movement of oil. Shale wells  ...\n Van Oort says the amount of time a well is closed doesn\u2019t really affect how much damage the shut-in inflicts on the reservoir. Once the well is closed, the damage is done. If producers have to repeatedly shut the well, the damage can compound over time and reduce productivity even more. \u201cIt is always best to leave the well alone once you go to production,\u201d says van Oort.\n  The situation is a bit better for the roughly 1,000 offshore oil derricks in the Gulf of Mexico. These are typically conventional wells where a pipe is drilled into the ground and oil is pumped up\u2014almost like  sucking a milkshakethrough a straw. Offshore oil producers are accustomed to temporarily turning wells off during hurricanes, and shut-ins don \u2019t have as big of a negative effect on their ability to produce oil. The reason for this, says McLennan, is because the offshore reservoirs are more  ...\n But even though offshore reservoirs might not sustain as much damage from shut-ins, McLennan says the wells are a bit more challenging to turn off. Some subsea pipelines may need to be protected if the oil contains waxy paraffins, which can solidify in pipelines at the bottom of the ocean, where temperatures are just a few degrees above freezing. So before an offshore well can be turned off, there \u2019s often a lot of preventative maintenance that needs to be done, like flushing the pipes and filling  ...\n Although the OPEC agreement to reduce production officially begins on Friday, many US producers started shutting their wells weeks ago in response to dismally low prices. These shut-ins have largely been led by the roughly 2,000 small independent and private oil companies in the US, most of which produce less than 20,000 barrels per day. \u201cThe brunt of the pain is being felt by small companies with fewer wells, \u201dsays Frederick Lawerence, vice president of economics and international affairs at  ...\n Smaller independent and private companies don \u2019t have many of the advantages afforded to large independents or global companies like BP or ConocoPhillips. Bigger companies have priority access to pipelines and storage, and also tend to have diversified revenue streams \u2014they don \u2019t just produce the oil, they also refine it, transport it and so on. Smaller companies, by contrast, are \u201ctotally dependent on the wellhead, \u201dLawerence says. Without significant storage capacity, they have no choice but  ...\n Large companies may be able to cushion the blow from the drop in demand, but even they are not immune to shut-ins. According to a  Wall Street Journal  report last week, offshore drillers have already started shutting in wells, and they will close more in the near future to meet the reduced production targets that the US and other countries agreed to in April.\n Lawrence says that widespread shut-ins of both conventional and fracked oil wells is unprecedented. He expects the wave of shut-ins will result in some consolidation among smaller producers or acquisitions by larger companies. Covid-19 won\u2019t kill American oil, he says, but \u201cwhat has transpired will ultimately change the nature of the industry that emerges.\u201d\n   \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Want the best tools to get healthy?

"note_en": "When the garden eels at a Tokyo aquarium remove their heads from the sand, they are usually confronted by pairs of human eyes staring back at them through the glass.\n But  like other animals around the world, the eels at Sumida Aquarium are finding their environment transformed by the effects of the  coronavirus outbreak.\n They also appear to be forgetting what humans look like. Concerned that the garden eels \u2013 so named because their grass-like appearance when, en masse, they poke their heads out of the seabed \u2013 could come to see visitors as a threat, the aquarium is asking people to get in touch in the form of a calming video calls.\n The aquarium, housed in Tokyo Skytree \u2013 Japan\u2019s tallest structure \u2013 has been closed since the start of March and its garden eels have become used to a largely human-free environment.\n But the aquarium said the \u201cunprecedented situation\u201d had had put the eels and other creatures ill at ease.\n  \u201cThey don\u2019t see humans, except keepers, and they have started forgetting about humans,\u201d it said on its Twitter account this week.\n \u201cGarden eels in particular disappear into the sand and hide every time the keepers pass by,\u201d it said, adding that their oversensitive nature was making it difficult to monitor their health.\n \u201cHere is an urgent request,\u201d the aquarium wrote. \u201cCould you show your face to our garden eels from your home?\u201d it said, naming the event a \u201cface-showing festival\u201d.\n While garden eels are sensitive and wary by nature, the 300 of them living in one of the aquarium\u2019s tanks had grown accustomed to human visitors and rarely hid when approached by visitors.\n To help the eels reconnect with their admirers, the aquarium is setting up five tablets facing their tank, with users asked to connect through iPhones or iPads via the FaceTime app.\n Once the video calls start, people are asked to show their faces, wave and talk to the eels. But, given the animals\u2019 natural bashfulness, they are requested not to raise their voices.\n The festival is scheduled for 3-5 May, at the height of the Golden Week holiday, when many people who would normally travel are staying home during the country\u2019s Covid-19 state of emergency.\n The aquarium\u2019s plea has attracted lots of online support, under the Japanese hashtag \u001d#PleaseRememberHumans.\n \u201c\u2018When you gaze at the garden eels, the garden eels gaze at you.\u2019 Understood. I\u2019m happy to take part,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.\n \u201cThey need training to learn humans are not a threat!\u201d another wrote. \u201cInteresting.\u201d\n Many called on the aquarium to offer access to the eels via another app to allow those using PCs and phones with Android operating systems to take part.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:06:23", "tags":

"note_en": "NUBIA is a SoTA evaluation metric for text generation. It stands for NeUral Based Interchangeability Assessor. In addition to returning an interchangeability score, NUBIA also returns scores for semantic relation, contradiction, irrelevancy, logical agreement, and grammaticality.\n     Nubia is composed of three modules. The first is neural feature extraction. The three main neural features that power the metric are semantic similarity, logical inference, and sentence legibility. These are extracted by exposing layers from powerful (pretrained) language models: RoBERTa STS for semantic similarity, RoBERTa MNLI for logical inference, and GPT-2 for sentence legibility.\n The second module is the aggregator. This module is trained to approximate a function mapping input neural features to a quality score that reflects how interchangeable the sentences are. The objective is to come as close as possible to human evaluation.\n The final module is calibration. This is necessary because the aggregator is not bound between 0 and 1, nor does a regressed score comparing a reference sentence with itself always ouput 1. So to calibrate, the output is normalized against the score of the reference sentence compared with itself, and bound between 0 and 1.\n  We have been able to achieve SoTA performance in assessing the quality of machine translation and image captioning. Results below are the Absolute Pearson correlations with segment-level human judgments on WMT17 to-English translations.\n  Results below are the Kendall\u2019s Tau correlations with human judgment on the Flickr 8K dataset.\n  Nubia is especially powerful against BLEU and ROUGE. The following are the score and label graphs of Nubia, ROUGE-L and BLEU for the entire WMT-2017 segment level set.\n    s1, s2 = &#34;He agreed to a proposal of mine.&#34;,&#34;He gave his agreement to my proposal.&#34;\n but the BLEU, ROUGE and BERTScore are low (0.43, 0.28, 0.63) whereas the Nubia score is 0.95\n Rouge_1 is: 0.4285714235714286Rouge_2 is: 0.0BlEU is: 0.2802636449867835BERTScore is: (0.5967282652854919, 0.6308560967445374, 0.6143679618835449)Nubia Score: 0.9504227034094436Semantic relation: 4.672990322113037/5.0Percent chance of contradiction: 0.26220036670565605%Percent chance of irrelevancy or new information: 0.5306123290210962%Percent chance of logical agreement: 99.20719265937805%\n   When  &#34;Impossible!&#34; was changed to  &#34;Totally feasible!&#34;, the contradiction score went from  0.073% to  99.5%, even though sentence  s1 is structured very differently.\n For more examples, check out the  repo and  colab notebook.

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Alan L. Hart (born Alberta Lucille Hart, October 4, 1890\u00a0\u2013 July 1, 1962) was an American physician, radiologist, tuberculosis researcher, writer and novelist. He was in 1917\u201318 one of the first  trans men to undergo  hysterectomy in the United States, and lived the rest of his life as a man. He pioneered the use of  x-ray photography in  tuberculosis detection, and helped implement TB screening programs that saved thousands of lives.  [1]\n    Hart was born October 4, 1890, in Halls Summit,  Coffey County, Kansas, to Albert L. Hart and Edna Hart (n\u00e9e Bamford). When his father died of  typhoid fever in 1892, his mother reverted to her maiden name and moved the family to  Linn County, Oregon, where she cared for her own mother during a period of sickness. When Hart was five years old his mother remarried, to Bill Barton, and the family moved to Edna&#39;s father&#39;s farm. Hart wrote later, in 1911,  ...\n As a suppressed male during his school years, Hart was allowed to write essays under his chosen name &#34;Robert Allen Bamford, Jr.&#34; with little resistance from his classmates or teachers. It was common at the time for writers to use  pseudonyms, including to assume names associated with the opposite gender. Hart published work in local newspapers and in school and college publications under this name, or as &#34;submitted by an anonymous boy&#34;,  ...\n   Hart attended Albany College (now  Lewis &amp; Clark College), then transferred with classmate and romantic partner Eva Cushman to  Stanford University for the 1911\u20131912 school year before going back to Albany.  [5] Hart graduated from Albany College in 1912, and in 1917 obtained a doctor of medicine degree from the  University of Oregon Medical Department in Portland (now  Oregon Health &amp; Science University); during this period, Hart also returned to  ...\n  Upon reaching adulthood Hart sought psychiatric  counselling and radical surgery to live as a man. Hart&#39;s was the first documented transgender male transition in the United States,  [8]  [9] though sex reassignment surgeries had been carried out earlier in Germany,  [10] including on one man, treated by German sexologist  Magnus Hirschfeld,  [11] who had won the right to serve in the German military.  [12] The 1906/07 case of  Karl M. Baerhad set a new precedent  ...\n In 1917, Hart approached Joshua Allen Gilbert, Ph.D., M.D., at the University of Oregon and requested surgery to eliminate  menstruation and the possibility of ever becoming pregnant.  [13] He also presented Gilbert with a  eugenicargument, that a person with &#34;abnormal inversion&#34; should be sterilized. Gilbert was initially reluctant, but accepted that Hart was &#34;extremely intelligent and not mentally ill, but afflicted with a mysterious disorder  ...\n Early FTM surgeries involved the implanting of testicular tissue in place of the removed ovaries.  [14] Crystalline  male hormones had been extracted in usable quantities from male urine by 1903,  [15] but it represented an infection risk. Synthetic hormones were not manufactured until 1920 (by  Bayer),  [16] and when given the opportunity, Hart underwent hormone therapy.  [17]\n Hart&#39;s surgery was completed at the University of Oregon Medical School  [18] over the 1917\u20131918 winter vacation. He then legally changed his name.\n He interned at San Francisco Hospital. A former classmate recognized him there, and he was outed as transgender in the  Spokesman-Review newspaper on Feb. 6, 1918. The article&#39;s opening sentence referred to him by his birth name and with female pronouns, describing him as having graduated from Stanford &#34;as a fluffy coed...[who] affected boyish mannerisms.&#34;  [19]\n In February 1918 he married his first wife Inez Stark and moved with her to  Gardiner, Oregon, to set up his own medical practice.\n In an interview with a local paper, Hart declared that he was &#34;happier since I made this change than I ever have in my life, and I will continue this way as long as I live [...] I have never concealed anything regarding my [change] to men&#39;s clothing [...] I came home to show my friends that I am ashamed of nothing.&#34;  [20]\n  In Oregon, Hart suffered an early blow when a former medical school classmate  outed him as transgender, forcing Hart and his wife to move. Hart found the experience traumatic and again consulted Gilbert, who wrote that Hart had suffered from &#34;the hounding process ... which our modern social organization can carry on to such perfection and refinement.&#34;. [   citation needed] Hart set up a new practice in remote  Huntley, Montana, writing later  ...\n The relocations, financial insecurity, and secrecy placed strain on Hart&#39;s marriage, and Inez left him in September 1923. She ordered him to have no further contact with her, and divorced him in 1925. The same year Hart married his second wife, Edna Ruddick; the union lasted until the end of Hart&#39;s life. In 1925 Hart moved to the  Trudeau School of Tuberculosisin New York, where he also carried out postgraduate work; he spent 1926 \u20131928  ...\n In 1948, after Hart obtained a master&#39;s degree in public health from  Yale, the couple moved to  Connecticut, where Hart had been appointed Director of Hospitalization and Rehabilitation for the Connecticut State Tuberculosis Commission. The couple lived for the rest of their lives in  West Hartford, Connecticut, where Edna became a professor at the  University of Hartford. After the  Second World Warsynthetic testosterone became available in  ...\n During the last six years of his life Hart gave numerous lectures, and dedicated all his free time to fundraising for medical research and to support patients with advanced TB who could not afford treatment. He was a member of the  American Thoracic Society,  American Public Health Association,  American Association for the Advancement of Science, and  American Civil Liberties Union, among many others. Socially, both he and Edna were well liked,  ...\n Hart died of  heart failure on July 1, 1962. The terms of his will directed his body be cremated and his ashes scattered over Puget Sound where he and Edna had spent many happy summers together.\n Hart said once, [   when?] in a speech to graduating medical students, &#34;Each of us must take into account the raw material which heredity dealt us at birth and the opportunities we have had along the way, and then work out for ourselves a sensible evaluation of our personalities and accomplishments&#34;.\n  Hart devoted much of his career to research into and treatment of  tuberculosis. In the early 20th century the disease was the biggest killer in America. Doctors, including Hart, were realizing that myriad illnesses \u2014consumption, phthisis, phthisis pulmonalis, Koch&#39;s disease, scrofula, lupus vulgaris, white plague, King&#39;s evil, Pott&#39;s disease, and Gibbus \u2014were all in fact cases of tuberculosis (TB). TB usually attacked victims&#39;  ...\n X-rays, or Roentgen rays as they were more commonly known until World War Two, had been discovered only in 1895, when Hart was five years old. In the early twentieth century they were used to detect bone fractures and tumors, but Hart became interested in their potential for detecting tuberculosis. Since the disease often presented no symptoms in its early stages, x-ray  screeningwas invaluable for early detection. Even rudimentary early  ...\n In 1937 Hart was hired by the Idaho Tuberculosis Association and later became the state&#39;s Tuberculosis Control Officer. He established up Idaho&#39;s first fixed-location and mobile TB screening clinics and spearheaded the state&#39;s war against tuberculosis. Between 1933 and 1945 Hart traveled extensively through rural Idaho, covering thousands of miles while lecturing, conducting mass TB screenings, training new staff, and treating  ...\n An experienced and accessible writer, Hart wrote widely for medical journals and popular publications, describing TB for technical and general audiences and giving advice on its prevention, detection, and cure. At the time the word &#34;tuberculosis&#34; carried a social stigma akin to venereal disease, so Hart insisted his clinics be referred to as &#34;chest clinics&#34;, himself as a &#34;chest doctor&#34;, and his patients as &#34;chest  ...\n In 1943 Hart, now recognised as preeminent in the field of tubercular Roentgenology, compiled his extensive evidence on TB and other x-ray-detectable cases into a definitive compendium,  These Mysterious Rays: A Nontechnical Discussion of the Uses of X-rays and Radium, Chiefly in Medicine (pub. Harper &amp; Brothers), still a standard text today. The book was translated into several languages, including Spanish.\n In 1948 Hart was appointed Director of Hospitalization and Rehabilitation for the Connecticut State Tuberculosis Commission. As in Idaho, Dr. Hart took charge of a massive statewide x-ray screening program for TB, emphasizing the importance of early detection and treatment. He held this position for the rest of his life, and is credited with helping contain the spread of tuberculosis in Connecticut as he had previously in the Pacific  ...\n  Alongside his medical practice and research, Hart pursued a second career as a novelist. He had in early life published in local, school, and college magazines, and later published four novels, chiefly on medical themes. His four novels incorporate semi-autobiographical themes:  The Undaunted(1936) contains a doctor, Richard Cameron, who describes himself as a &#39;cripple&#39; after his foot is amputated following persistent bone infection.  ...\n  These short stories were collected in  The Life and Career of Alberta Lucille/Dr. Alan L. Hart, with collected early writings, by Brian Booth.

Norton &amp; Company, Inc.)An overnight best-seller, Hart&#39;s first novel drew on his experiences as a small town doctor in Gardiner, Oregon. It portrayed the medical profession as increasingly venal, and was the first expos\u00e9 of the medical world by a working doctor.\n 1936  The Undaunted (Published W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.)This novel showed gay physician &#34;Sandy Farquhar&#34; pursuing a career in radiology &#34;because he thought it wouldn&#39;t matter so much in a laboratory what a man&#39;s personality was,&#34; conflicts and themes which Hart himself had experienced in his early career.\n 1937  In the Lives of Men (Published W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.)Hart&#39;s third novel was favourably reviewed for its insights into contemporary medicine, but the reviewer at a national magazine ( The Saturday Review of Literature) noted &#34;as a doctor, Hart knows surprisingly little about women&#34;.  [23]\n 1942  Doctor Finlay Sees it Through (Published by Harper &amp; Brothers)Hart&#39;s final novel, not to be confused with  A. J. Cronin&#39;s   Dr Finlay&#39;s Casebook, is considered to have influenced subsequent medical fiction.  [24]\n  After Hart&#39;s death his wife acted on his wish to establish a fund for research into  leukaemia, from which his mother had died. The interest on his estate is donated annually to the Alan L. and Edna Ruddick Hart Fund, which makes grants for research into leukaemia and its cure.\n Hart&#39;s  will, written in 1943, stipulated that his personal letters and photographs be destroyed, and this was done on his death in 1962. Hart had acted all his life to control the interpretation of his private and emotional life, and the destruction of his personal records at his death were commensurate with this goal.  [25]Believing that the secret of his personal history was safe he made no attempt to account for  ...\n  Scholarship on Hart&#39;s life has disagreed bitterly on whether he should be characterised as  transgender, or  lesbian, while activists and advocates for various groups have claimed Hart as a representative.\n Jonathan Ned Katz, who in  Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A. (1976) first identified Hart as the pseudonymous &#34;H&#34; in Joseph Gilbert&#39;s 1920s case notes, described Hart as a lesbian and depicted his case as one where contemporary strictures against lesbianism were so strong that a &#39;woman&#39; like Hart had to adopt a male identity to pursue love affairs with women.  [28]Katz contended  ...\n Against Katz&#39;s claims, others like Jillian Todd Weiss have asserted that Hart experienced himself as a man from early childhood, identifying  transphobia and &#34;blatant disregard for transgender identities&#34; in the claim that Hart was &#39;really&#39; a woman.  [31] Hart&#39;s widow refused interviews to Katz, offended by his categorization of her husband (and by extension, herself) as lesbian.  [32]\n Some historians note that Hart never described himself as transsexual, but the term was not published until the 1920s, and not widely used until the 1960s, near Hart&#39;s death.  [33]It is also true that Hart worked hard to keep his pre-transition identity secret, and would hardly have sought to publicly claim a trans identity. Others, then, have contended that Hart was a trans pioneer, who lived after his transition  ...\n Joy Parks describes the battle, especially within  Portland, Oregon  GLBT communities over Hart&#39;s identity as &#34;extremely ugly&#34; and one in which &#34;neither side appeared particularly victorious.&#34;  [34]\n    In 2002 the Aubrey Watzek Library at  Lewis &amp; Clark College ran an exhibition on Hart&#39;s life and early writings, titled  &#34;The Lives of Men&#34;: A Literary Glimpse at the Life of Alberta Lucille Hart/Dr. Alan L. Hart, a title drawing on one of Hart&#39;s novels. The exhibition&#39;s run was extended by nearly a month in light of unexpectedly high interest.\n In 1994, the story of Alan Lucille Hart and Eva Cushman&#39;s attendance at  Stanford University, along with a brief description of their subsequent lives, was included in the historical exhibition &#34;Coming to Terms: Passionate Friendship to Gay Liberation on the Farm&#34; at  Cecil H. Green Libraryat Stanford. The exhibition was curated by independent scholar Gerard Koskovich; it ran from July through October  ...\n Hart and Cushman&#39;s story also was featured in a second historical exhibition at Stanford University: &#34;Creating Queer Space at Stanford: Pages From a Student Scrapbook,&#34; which was on display in April and May 2004 in the second floor lobby of Tresidder Memorial Union on the Stanford campus.

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  The  behavioral immune system is a phrase coined by the psychological scientist  Mark Schaller to refer to a suite of psychological mechanisms that allow individual organisms to detect the potential presence of disease-causing  parasites in their immediate environment, and to engage in behaviors that prevent contact with those objects and individuals.  [1]  [2]  [3]\n These mechanisms include sensory processes through which cues connoting the presence of parasitic infections are perceived (e.g., the smell of a foul odor, the sight of  pox or  pustules), as well as  stimulus\u2013response systems through which these sensory cues trigger a cascade of aversive affective, cognitive, and behavioral reactions (e.g., arousal of  disgust, automatic activation of cognitions that connote the threat of disease, behavioral avoidance).  [2]  ...\n The existence of a behavioral immune system has been documented across many animal species, including humans. It is theorized that the mechanisms that comprise the behavioral immune system evolved as a crude first line of defense against disease-causing pathogens.  [2]\n   Within the  psychological sciences, there is extensive research linking the behavioral immune system to a variety of prejudices \u2014including prejudices against people who aren&#39;t actually diseased but are simply characterized by some sort of visual characteristics that deviate from those of a subjectively prototypical human being. The disease \u2013avoidant processes that characterize the behavioral immune system have been shown to contribute to prejudices  ...\n In addition, the behavioral immune system appears to contribute to  xenophobia and  ethnocentrism.  [8]  [9] One implication is that these prejudices tend to be exaggerated under conditions in which people feel especially vulnerable to the potential transmission of infectious diseases.\n Additional lines of research on the behavioral immune system have shown that people engage in more reticent and conservative forms of behavior under conditions in which they feel more vulnerable to disease transmission. For instance, when the potential threat of disease is made salient, people tend to be less extraverted or sociable.  [10]Evidence suggests that the behavioral immune system also incorporates mechanisms designed to search out and process  ...\n  The behavioral immune system also has consequences at a  cultural level of analysis. Under ecological circumstances in which diseases are more prevalent, people also tend to display more reticent and socially restricted forms of behavior, and human cultures are defined by more conservative norms and value systems.  [12]  [13]\n  Some research suggests that the behavioral immune system has implications for the functioning of the physiological  immune system too. One study found that the mere visual perception of diseased-looking people stimulated white blood cells to respond more aggressively to infection (as indicated by the production of the proinflammatory  cytokine  Interleukin 6 in response to a bacterial stimulus).  [14]\n Research also indicates that immune-relevant interventions which target pathogen transmission can interrupt behavioral responses. For example, receiving a flu vaccination or washing one&#39;s hands can reduce the extent of negative interpersonal and intergroup attitudes elicited by disease cues and concerns.

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  The  Joy programming language in  computer science is a  purely functional programming language that was produced by Manfred von Thun of  La Trobe University in  Melbourne,  Australia. Joy is based on composition of functions rather than  lambda calculus. It has turned out to have many similarities to  Forth, due not to design but to a sort of parallel evolution and convergence. It was also inspired by the  function-level programming style of  John Backus&#39;s  FP  ...\n   Joy is unusual (except for  function-level programming languages and some esoteric ones, such as  unlambda) in its lack of a  lambda operator, and therefore lack of  formal parameters. To illustrate this with a common example, here is how the square function might be defined in an  imperative programming language ( C):\n  The variable x is a formal parameter which is replaced by the actual value to be squared when the function is called. In a  functional language ( Scheme) the same function could be defined:\n  This is different in many ways, but it still uses the formal parameter x in the same way. In Joy the square function is defined:\n  In Joy, everything is a function that takes a  stack as an argument and returns a stack as a result. For instance, the numeral &#39;5&#39; does not represent an integer constant, but instead a short program that pushes the number 5 onto the stack.\n The  dup operator simply duplicates the top element of the stack by pushing a copy of it.\n So the square function makes a copy of the top element, and then multiplies the two top elements of the stack, leaving the square of the original top element at the top of the stack, with no need for a formal parameter. This makes Joy concise, as illustrated by this definition of  quicksort:\n  &#34;binrec&#34; is one of Joy&#39;s many  recursive  combinators, implementing binary recursion. It expects four quoted programs on top of the stack which represent:\n the termination condition (if a list is &#34;small&#34; (1 or 0 elements) it is already sorted),\n  what to do by default (split the list into two halves by comparing each element with the pivot), and finally\n  In Joy, the  meaning function is a  homomorphism from the  syntactic  monoid onto the  semantic  monoid. That is, the syntactic relation of  concatenation of  symbols maps directly onto the semantic relation of  composition of  functions. It is a  homomorphism rather than an  isomorphism, because it is  onto but not  one-to-one; that is, no symbol has more than one meaning, but some sequences of symbols have the same meaning (e.g. &#34;dup +&#34; and &#34;2 *&#34;).\n Joy is a  concatenative programming language: &#34;The concatenation of two programs denotes the composition of the functions denoted by the two programs&#34;.  [2]\n Its library routines mirror those of ISO  C, though the current implementation is not easily extensible with functions written in C.\n    ^   Manfred von Thun (December 12, 2003).  &#34;A Conversation with Manfred von Thun&#34; .   In the early 1980s I came across the famous Backus paper &#34;Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style,&#34; and I was immediately intrigued by the higher level of programming in his FP.\n  von Thun, Manfred;  Thomas, Reuben (October 9, 2001).  &#34;Joy: Forth&#39;s Functional Cousin&#34;  (PDF).
