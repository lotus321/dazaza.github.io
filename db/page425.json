For everyone else who doesn \u2019t have access to this infrastructure, building practical  ...\n We started Determined AI three years ago to bring AI-native software infrastructure to the broader market. Working closely with cutting-edge deep learning teams across a variety of industries, a clear narrative emerged: without better infrastructure, training deep learning models at scale remains extremely difficult, as organizations move from research to production. This feedback led us to build the Determined Training Platform, which now powers teams of Deep Learning Engineers and large GPU clusters  ...\n Our innovative infrastructure platform is now ready for widespread adoption, and we\u2019re excited to share it with the DL community! Today we are announcing that  we have  open sourced our deep learning training platform under the Apache 2.0 license.\n  We designed the  Determined Training Platform to empower Deep Learning Engineers to focus on the task at hand \u2014 training high-quality models. To achieve this goal, our platform tightly integrates all of the features that a DL engineer needs to train models at scale, including:\n  High-performance distributed training that just works.Determined \u2019s distributed training support builds upon Horovod, a popular distributed training framework, but includes a suite of optimizations that results in twice the performance of stock Horovod. Moreover, Determined \u2019s distributed training support is easy to set up (no code changes are needed to move from single-GPU to distributed training), and allows multiple users to seamlessly share the same GPU cluster.

Determined\u2019s search functionality builds on our cutting-edge research over the past decade. 1,2,3,4,5 Our hyperparameter search integrates tightly with our job scheduler and is parallel by default \u2014 so you can get to more accurate models 100x faster than standard search methods and 10x faster than Bayesian Optimization methods.\n DL tools for individuals and teams. Determined helps you excel in experiment management with experiment tracking, log management, metrics visualization, reproducibility, and dependency management. These tools boost productivity for individual DL engineers over the lifespan of a project, and are essential for growing teams to collaborate and scale efficiently.\n Hardware-agnostic and integrated with the Open Source Ecosystem. Determined supports the public cloud and on-prem infrastructure, which means you can avoid getting locked into proprietary solutions. Moreover, Determined works with your DL framework of choice, exports to popular serving frameworks, and more generally integrates with a wide range of data prep and model serving technologies (see figure below).\n   The Determined Training Platform already powers hundreds of GPUs at innovative companies. Here are some insights into how two of our current customers have integrated Determined\u2019s platform to become a core part of their DL efforts:\n \u201cWith AI at the forefront of Recursion\u2019s vision for biopharmaceuticals, we use Determined to manage 100s of on-premise GPUs, as well as dynamically scale to using GPUs on Google Cloud Platform. Using Determined\u2019s native support for distributed training, we were able to reduce the training time for a key computer vision model from 3 days to 3 hours, without changing our model code.\u201d \u2014Ben Mabey, Interim CTO, Recursion\n \u201cBy adopting Determined AI\u2019s software platform, our team of deep learning engineers has been able to rapidly deliver new, advanced, Industrial IoT products to our customers. We\u2019re delivering new AI features 10 times faster than before.\u201d \u2014Ben Chehebar, Chief Product Officer, Compology\n We look forward to building the future of AI-native infrastructure together. We invite you to  check us out on GitHub,  install the product, and  read the documentation.

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has committed $250 million directly to fight the pandemic.\n Indeed, in  an interview with the Financial Times, the Microsoft co-founder pledged that the $40 billion foundation would give its \u201ctotal attention\u201d to a crisis that he fears will cost the world \u201ctens of trillions of dollars.\u201d\n He told the newspaper, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken an organization that was focused on HIV and malaria and polio eradication, and almost entirely shifted it to work on this. This has the foundation\u2019s total attention. Even our non-health related work, like higher education and K-12 (schools), is completely switched around to look at how you facilitate online learning.\u201d\n His fact-based approach and his defense of the World Health Organization have also put him at odds with a president for whom truth is, er, situational. This has  made Gates a target of right-wing attacks and conspiracy theories.\n The world\u2019s second-richest person stepping up in this arena is a contrast to the richest, Jeff Bezos, who is back hands-on at Amazon. The pandemic has brought hefty revenues to Seattle\u2019s largest company because of stay-home shoppers \u2014 but also unprecedented challenges. Bezos said Thursday the \u201ccurrent crisis is demonstrating the adaptability and durability of Amazon\u2019s business as never before, but it\u2019s also the hardest time we\u2019ve ever

Wall Street on Thursday by  posting a first-quarter profit despite the wider economic slowdown brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.\n  Today\u2019s tweet might be extra curious those who remember the details of Musk\u2018s settlement with the SEC over alleged securities fraud.\n Aside from having to step down as company\u00a0chairman, it requires someone\u00a0 double-check any Musk tweet that might affect\u00a0value of Tesla stock.\n When asked about how this process will work in  a 60 minutes interview, Musk said it himself: \u201cThe only tweets that would have to be say \u2018reviewed,\u2019 would be if it had a probability of causing a movement in the stock.\u201d\n After being pressed on how one would know if a tweet had that potential, he quipped: \u201cI guess we
