"note_en": "Let&#39;s imagine a scenario in which you are dealing with JSON in your application and you want to store it in your database. You let out a heavy sigh and think, &#34;I guess I am going to have to add something besides my favorite DB (Postgres) to my  architecture. I wish I could just keep using PostgreSQL.&#34;\n You start thinking that instead of one problem, now you have many. You&#39;re probably going to have to learn a new data query syntax, data creation statement, install new software, and worst of all for you as an app developer, running some new server in production. Now rather than developing your features, you are going to be spending valuable time learning, experimenting, and praying.\n Well my friend, today is the day your wishes come true. In the blog post we will talk a little about how you can use PostgreSQL for all your JSON needs. We will also point you at some free learning  resources so you can  dig in deeper.\n  Since 9.2, released in September 2012, PostgreSQL has had a JSON type. This original JSON type was not much more than just a simple storage field that let you dump JSON into your database table. It is just a simple text field that checks to make sure your JSON is well formed. Other than that it doesn&#39;t do much and I would not recommend using it.\n With PostgreSQL release 9.4 in December 2014, a JSOB type was added. Though I joke that the B stands for better it really stands for Binary. When you put JSON data into a JSONB column, in addition to checking for well formed JSON, you now have the ability to indexing and query and retrieve portions of the document. Generally for all your work you should use JSONB unless you have a compelling reason not to. Here are a couple of nice discussions on the  tradeoffs and  choosing JSON versus  JSONB  ...\n   {\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;person&#34;:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;first_name&#34;: &#34;Steve&#34;,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;last_name&#34;: &#34;Pousty&#34;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0},\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;score&#34; : 100,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;status&#34; : &#34;Awesome&#34;,\u00a0\u00a0 &#34;best_feature&#34; : &#34;humbleness&#34;}\n  Once you put it in a JSOB column named  json_content (and make a  GIN Index for faster queries) you can do all sorts of fun things. Please note that I will be using the JSONB navigation and function syntax found in PostgreSQL version 11. There was a major improvement to JSON document navigation and querying in version 12 which will be the focus of another blog post.\n    The  #&gt; or  #&gt;&gt; is the JSON path navigator with the difference being  #&gt; returns JSON and the  #&gt;&gt; returns the JSON text value.\n  Using that same document navigation syntax, we can then combine that with the containment check. Just like the name sounds, we will check to see if the stored JSON contains the JSON we are looking for. For example, if we wanted to return only those records that had a status of awesome we would write:\n    operator looks for JSON that contains the JSON on the right side of the operator.  The best part of working with JSON in PostgreSQL is that you get to leverage all the normal SQL you already love along with these JSON functions. SQL processing can be used to greatly reduce the amount of code you need in your application. For example, here is the query to get all the distinct status types in the table:\n   So if you are intrigued by what you saw here and want to learn more here are some  great resources (if I do say so myself).\n We have an  online tutorial to get your started with JSON in PostgreSQL. It is free and available 24/7 and\u00a0 I also did \u00a0a live stream walking through the material above.\n Let us know  @crunchydata what you think of the material! I would also love to hear about how YOU are using JSON with PostgreSQL.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:56:04", "tags": "postgresql,\u7528\u4e8e,json", "title":

"note_en": "In recent weeks, on a quiet stretch of Detroit\u2019s west side dotted with vacant homes, a 262,000-square-foot Coca-Cola manufacturing facility has buzzed with activity, even as many businesses in Michigan were ordered by the state to temporarily close to combat the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n Coca-Cola churns out a number of beverages here, including Dasani bottled water, which generated more than $1 billion in U.S. sales in the past year, according to market research firm IRI. It\u2019s a good time to be in the water business: As the coronavirus pandemic spread in the U.S. throughout March, bottled water sales increased 57 percent over the same time period last year.\n But among the products, such as toilet paper and\u00a0 hand sanitizer, that Americans are panic-buying, bottled water is unusual: There is no shortage of safe drinking water, and health officials have tried to assure people that public water supplies are not contaminated by the coronavirus. Hoarding bottled water simply isn\u2019t necessary for most people.\n  What\u2019s more, most bottled water sold in the U.S. comes from the same municipal sources that supply tap water\u2014a fact that might be unknown to most consumers. Coca-Cola makes Dasani at the company\u2019s Detroit plant by purchasing, treating, and bottling municipal water before selling it at a significant upcharge to consumers. Pepsi bottles its Aquafina water brand in Detroit the same way.\n The business model is hugely profitable. The cost to buy that municipal water is exceedingly low\u2014and once bottled, the markup can be around 133 times greater, a Consumer Reports analysis of company water billing and usage records found.\n But what\u2019s good for businesses isn\u2019t necessarily good for consumers, according to CR\u2019s review, which included the examination of hundreds of pages of billing and other records obtained through public records requests, and interviews with environmental law experts, industry consultants, residents of Detroit, and consumer advocates.\n For starters, bottlers and consumers aren\u2019t always treated as equals by water utilities, CR found. In Detroit, whose policy prior to the coronavirus crisis called for shutting off water to residents if they fell $150 behind in their water bills, 2,800 homes were estimated to be without running water at the start of the pandemic. (Read more about  cities that have not restored water to residents during the coronavirus crisis.)\n But bottlers in Detroit have also racked up tens of thousands of dollars of past-due water bills that went unpaid for months, CR found. Not once has their access to water been shut off over the time period we examined. When asked why, the city cited the companies\u2019 strong payment history and an ability to pay their bills.\u00a0The city said in a later statement that it had made errors collecting past-due balances.\n  From a regulatory point of view, companies that want to put vast quantities of public water into bottles for profit face few hurdles and minimal ancillary costs, leading some experts to call for taxes on the bottlers. And because the water supply, including the processing and infrastructure, that bottlers rely on is paid for by local taxpayers, the companies\u2019 business is subsidized by the public, consumer advocates say.\n \u201cThese bottlers are essentially double-dipping\u2014receiving low-cost water subsidized by taxpayers and then turning around and selling it back to the public at a significant markup,\u201d says Brian Ronholm, CR\u2019s director of food policy.\n  Detroit has been questioned about the potential health risk of water shutoffs before. In August 2014, residents who had their taps turned off argued in court to suspend shutoffs because a lack of water could create unsanitary conditions and lead to the transmission of hepatitis A, influenza, and other diseases.\n Detroit\u2019s lawyers argued that those residents could rely on alternative sources\u2014like bottled water. \u201cJust because a person is out of water doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t get water,\u201d a city lawyer said at a court hearing.\n The judge in the case ultimately sided with the city, and the shutoff campaign carried on.\n Now, six years later, Detroit and other cities have taken some steps to address residential water shutoffs during the coronavirus crisis\u2014people need running water not just to cook and bathe but also to practice basic virus-fighting hygiene.\n  A Detroit spokesperson says all customers who called to enroll in a program that would turn their water back on during the pandemic have either been restored or are in the process of a restoration. But the spokesperson concedes that some occupants might not have called, and advocates dispute the city\u2019s reported progress.\n \u201cWe believe the city of Detroit is vastly exaggerating their progress and underreporting the number of people without water,\u201d Shea Howell\u2014a member of the People\u2019s Water Board, an advocacy group based in Detroit\u2014said during a recent teleconference with reporters.\n The coronavirus pandemic has underscored just how problematic water shutoffs can be, as utilities servicing nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population still have not committed to suspending water shutoffs, according to  Food &amp; Water Watch. This has consumer advocates worried.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just unconscionable to make people fear losing their water service at this time,\u201d says Mary Grant, director of the Public Water for All campaign at Food &amp; Water Watch. \u201cWe need every governor to step up to address this crisis immediately.\u201d\n It\u2019s a striking situation. People whose water gets shut off because they can\u2019t afford their bill may have no choice but to buy bottled water that comes from the same source that feeds their tap. They may be obtaining bottled water from companies that have been behind on their water bills but didn\u2019t face a shutoff, and whose business depends on access to publicly funded water systems.\n And it\u2019s not just in Detroit: Coca-Cola and Pepsi get water from other major cities, including Phoenix and Denver, with a history of shutting off water to residents before the coronavirus crisis.\n Coca-Cola didn\u2019t respond to questions from CR about water shutoffs or its late payments, but the company says that it obtains water from a variety of sources, including municipal supplies, and uses a treatment process that \u201ccreates a consistent pure, clean, and crisp taste.\u201d The company remains in operation, the company says, because the federal government identified the food and beverage industry as \u201ccritical\u201d to keeping grocery stores stocked.\n  Beulah Walker, chief coordinator for the nonprofit group Hydrate Detroit, which assists residents without running water, pointed out the irony of the situation for residents who have lost their water service at home and may turn to bottled water\u2014possibly Aquafina or Dasani made with city tap water\u2014as an alternative.\n  Two decades ago, most bottled water in the U.S. came from natural springs, sold by brands such as Evian and Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Poland Spring. But bottlers soon came to see the benefit of tap water as a source, says Erik Olson, senior strategic director of health and food at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC): It\u2019s cheaper. \u201cAnd the more water you use, often, the less you pay per gallon,\u201d he says.\n After Coca-Cola and Pepsi introduced their bottled water brands in the 1990s, the industry began to shift from spring water to \u201cpurified,\u201d which generally means municipal water that is treated further, sometimes through a process called reverse osmosis. In 2000, spring water made up 67 percent of the bottled water market and the rest was purified water. By 2018, those numbers had essentially flipped, industry data show, with purified water now dominating the market.\n The International Bottled Water Association, an industry group, asserts that bottled water provides consumers with a value-added product. \u201cPurified bottled water is not just tap water in a bottle,\u201d says Jill Culora, an IBWA spokesperson. (Coca-Cola and Pepsi aren\u2019t members of the IBWA.)\n \u201cThe chemical and physical quality of this bottled water product is not the same as the water that comes out of the tap,\u201d she says.\n See how much the average American consumes of the nation&#39;s most popular non-alcoholic bottled beverages each year.\n But bottlers have caught some flack for failing to correct consumers\u2019 misimpression that all bottled water came from natural spring sources. In 2007, for example, following criticism, Pepsi agreed to state on Aquafina labels that the water was sourced from a municipal supply. \u201cIf this helps clarify the fact that the water originates from public sources, then it\u2019s a reasonable thing to do,\u201d the company said at the time.\n Aquafina and Dasani continue to rack up dramatic sales for Pepsi and Coca-Cola, respectively. Last year, industry data show, each company cleared $1 billion in U.S. sales of their bottled tap water brands.\n Companies turning tap water into bottled water can thank the Food and Drug Administration and state regulators, which together oversee the nation\u2019s bottled water, for making the regulatory approval process a relative snap.\n For instance, in Michigan Coca-Cola and Pepsi had to provide documentation showing that the Detroit Water &amp; Sewerage Department (DWSD) certified that its tap supply source is safe for consumption. They also had to confirm that their facilities were connected to the Detroit system before paying $25 for a permit to sell a product in the state.\n By contrast, when a company wants to launch a spring water brand, they have to undergo a far more complicated and costly process. That includes finding a groundwater source and building the machinery to pump the water up and the infrastructure to transport it to a processing facility\u2014as well as surmounting regulatory hurdles to get the water tested for safety and approved. (Culora says the IBWA couldn\u2019t comment on production cost differences between spring and municipal water.)\n  And while it \u2019s true that the vast majority of bottlers \u2014if not all \u2014using a public water supply will clean it further, they don \u2019t necessarily have to. If a company bottles tap water but does not treat it, it \u2019s required to explicitly note on the label that its product comes from a municipal or community source and the product cannot be labeled \u201cpurified. \u201d(Water that is treated further is not required to be labeled as being from a municipal source, but some products, including Aquafina,  ...\n It\u2019s unclear how many brands produce water this way; the IBWA says it\u2019s not aware of any bottled water products that use a municipal source and aren\u2019t purified, asserting that the possibility any such brand exists is \u201cextremely unlikely.\u201d\n But the IBWA doesn\u2019t represent all bottlers, and in fact, some cities even toyed with the idea of bottling their tap water in the 1990s.\n In 2014, Detroit\u2019s shutoff policy drew national attention when the city, which emerged that year from bankruptcy, launched a campaign to disconnect service to residents in arrears\u2014forcing some people to turn to other sources, such as capturing rainwater or buying bottled water. Shutoffs have continued since then, but officials concluded in early March that a reprieve was needed to try to help residents during the coronavirus outbreak.\n  Ricky Reynolds is one of the beneficiaries. The 65-year-old Detroit resident moved into his home down the road from Coca-Cola\u2019s bottling plant last summer after obtaining the deed from an acquaintance for $500. It should have been a happy occasion. Reynolds had been homeless, bouncing between family and friends, so it was a relief to get his own place\u2014until he tried to get the water bill put in his name.\n Reynolds, who is retired, learned from the city that his new home had a nearly $20,000 unpaid water bill.\n \u201cIt\u2019s hard to catch up with $20,000 when you have a fixed income,\u201d he says. And the city refused to turn on his water unless he paid 10 percent of the bill, he says, a monumental demand for someone living on Social Security income. Reynolds was never able to pay the bill.\n In the months before the city finally restored his water service during the pandemic, Reynolds says, he had to fill up containers with water from family members, then haul them home. And he bought bottled water whenever he could\u2014including, he says, Dasani, which may have been made around the corner at the Coca-Cola plant. (The city didn\u2019t directly respond to questions about Reynolds\u2019 case.)\n Detroit\u2019s temporarily suspended shutoff policy states that residents or businesses are delinquent and potentially risk having their water shut off if they are 60 days past due with a minimum balance of $150, a spokesperson says. (The city considers a company\u2019s accounting practices, as well, before determining whether to proceed with a service interruption.)\n  Between April and July 2017, billing records show, Coca-Cola had a $77,600 balance that went unpaid for three months. From August to November of that year, it carried a balance of as much as $287,250 before paying it off. From December 2017 to March 2018, the company had a balance that fluctuated between $1,860 to $108,170 before paying it off in full. Meanwhile, from December 2018 to February 2019, Pepsi had a balance between $1,410 and $29,710 until paying it off.\n  \u201cSince both Pepsi and Coca-Cola have a strong payment history and an unmatched ability to pay their bills, DWSD does not pursue service interruptions,\u201d says Bryan Peckinpaugh, a DWSD spokesperson. \u201cThese companies never go longer than three months past due, at which time the balances due, including late fees, are paid. These companies are not a priority target for service interruption due to their payment history and ability to pay.\u201d\n (After CR published this article, the DWSD said that, contrary to Peckinpaugh\u2019s previous statement, the past-due balances cited on the billing data were due to errors on the city&#39;s part, including address mailing issues. Regardless, while the city registered Pepsi and Coca-Cola as delinquent, and continued sending bills and assessing late fees, it never shut off the companies\u2019 water.)\n Coca-Cola and Pepsi didn\u2019t respond to CR\u2019s questions about why they went months without paying their bills.\n  \u201cYou should have a policy and should apply it equitably,\u201d she says. \u201cI think this is discrimination against low-income households in Detroit, that you\u2019re having a shutoff policy and you\u2019re not applying it, the same shutoff policy, to these big corporations because you expect them to pay down the road.\u201d\n Reynolds was also stunned to hear that Detroit let Coca-Cola and Pepsi\u2019s bills slide.\n \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re picking on the little guy.\u201d\n For bottlers, a single municipal source can generate significant revenue, according to records CR obtained.\n Pepsi\u2019s average output of Aquafina at a Pennsylvania manufacturing plant is approximately 9.36 million cases per year, according to a January 2018 inspection report. At an industry wholesale average of $1.33 per gallon, that means Pepsi could gross $19.73 million to $23.36 million annually from Aquafina produced at just that one plant, according to an analysis by CR.\n By contrast, billing records obtained by CR show that Pepsi paid $467,941 for water in 2017 to Harrisburg\u2019s water utility operator for 51.21 million gallons\u2014or about one penny per gallon. Pepsi has at least 12 bottling facilities that make Aquafina in the U.S. Coca-Cola has more than 30 that make Dasani.\n In Detroit, Pepsi\u2019s plant can push out on average between \u201c500,000 and 600,000 cases of product each day\u201d at its plant just outside of Detroit\u2019s Eastern Market district, according to a 2017 inspection report. (That number counts not just Aquafina but also all Pepsi beverages made at the plant, including soda and bottled tea.)\n Coca-Cola has a seemingly good deal in Detroit, too. The company paid the city about $1 million for water and associated fees in 2018, records show, which is less than 0.3 percent of all revenue the DWSD generated in fiscal 2018. That same year, Coca-Cola received 106.13 million gallons of water.\n A spokesperson for Coca-Cola told CR that it financially supports Detroit and other cities in which it operates by paying commercial rates for the water it uses. But, at least in Detroit, the rate the city charges bottlers and city residents is the same.\n \u201cPepsiCo and Coca-Cola are charged the same water, sewerage, and drainage rates as any customer in Detroit,\u201d says Peckinpaugh at the DWSD.\n  Environmentalists and consumer advocates say that, as a result, bottled water companies are effectively being subsidized by taxpayers.\n \u201cThe public paid for the water treatment plant to be built, the public paid for the intake structure, the public paid for decades of laying pipes down, the distribution system, the maintenance of that\u2014all those costs are sunk costs,\u201d says the NRDC\u2019s Olson. He adds that the companies also don\u2019t have to contribute to ongoing maintenance costs, essentially giving them a \u201cfree ride.\u201d\n The IBWA disputes that characterization. Culora, the spokesperson, says that bottled water companies pay utilities for the water they use and that, in doing so, they help \u201cthe city generate additional revenue without needing to increase the rates that consumers pay for their tap water.\u201d\n But Jim Olson, an environmental and water rights lawyer who works with For Love of Water, a nonprofit based in Michigan, agrees with Erik Olson (who\u2019s unrelated) that the system as it is gives bottlers a financial break. His group drafted a model law that would, among other things, charge bottling companies a royalty or fee on the sale of water, with the proceeds going to a state fund.\n \u201cWhat we have is an ongoing, very lucrative subsidy for the bottled water industry by ratepayers,\u201d Jim Olson says.\n Others are offering different ways to raise funds from bottlers that can be put toward the cost of maintaining water system infrastructure or providing financial aid to residents behind on their water bill. One idea is for bottlers to pay a tax on their product, or for municipalities to assess one at the point of sale.\n Nick Schroeck, an environmental law expert and associate dean of experiential education at the University of Detroit Mercy, writing in 2018 for The Conversation, an academic news site, focused on  a long-running environmental controversyin northern Michigan involving Nestl\u00e9, which pays a $200 annual permitting fee to suck up millions of gallons of spring water in the state. Public outrage had been \u201csimmering \u201dover how little Nestl\u00e9 pays for access to a public resource vs. how much  ...\n At the time, Michigan lawmakers were considering a tax of 5 cents per gallon on water harvested from groundwater by bottlers, who would pay the tax, with the intention of generating revenue for a dedicated fund for water infrastructure costs. But the bill died in the legislature.\n Schroeck tells CR he believes there\u2019s still potential in this idea. He suggests a tax for bottlers could be used to help low-income residents struggling to pay their water bills. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s a legitimate public health safety purpose for it, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem,\u201d he says.\n  The IBWA\u2019s Culora says her group opposes any effort to tax bottled water. She points to a recent report by the California State Water Resources Control Board that examined the possibility of using a bottled water tax at the point of sale to fund a financial aid program for low-income residents. The tax  could raise $153.6 millionfor such a fund, according to a draft of the report, though, it says, the tax \u201ccould have a regressive impact on low-income households that purchase bottled  ...\n But the board adds in the report that most bottled water expenditures are discretionary, and there\u2019s a \u201cpossible basis\u201d for taxing it to fund such a program because it contributes to \u201cpublic trash and other environmental impacts.\u201d (A final version of the report is not complete. Coca-Cola didn\u2019t respond directly to questions by CR about a tax.)\n Since 2016, nearly 16,000 households in Detroit have enrolled in a local financial aid program, according to the city \u2019s water department. But Nick Leonard, executive director of the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit based in Detroit, says that additional measures are needed to help residents unable to pay. They would ultimately benefit utilities, he adds, by generating more revenue for the utility because more residents would be able to keep up with their bills.  ...\n Consumer Reports agrees there\u2019s viability in taxing bottled water to fund a financial aid program. \u201cA tax on bottlers could be viewed by states and municipalities as a way to help offset that arrangement and allow them to apply needed funds toward assisting low-income residents with their water bills and/or improving their water system infrastructure,\u201d says Ronholm, CR\u2019s director of food policy.\n If you\u2019re concerned about the quality of your tap water and are on a public system, you should be able to get a report from your local water authority about the level of contaminants that may be present, if you\u2019re serviced by a community water system. The Environmental Protection Agency and World Health Organization say that the novel coronavirus has not been detected in municipal supplies, and risk of it happening is low.\n \u201cMost water in the U.S. is safe, and if you\u2019re hoarding bottled water, you\u2019re taking it away from people who might not have safe water at home, people who\u2019ve been shut off,\u201d says Grant at Food &amp; Water Watch.\n Water filters are an option for those who want to exercise added caution, as well. In the past, CR has reviewed filters for their ability to remove certain potentially dangerous contaminants.\n Consumer advocates and activists say that while the move to suspend shutoffs is encouraging, a long-term solution is necessary. That was a theme echoed by public health experts and advocates at a teleconference earlier this month on the move to ban shutoffs in Detroit during the pandemic, including Monica Lewis-Patrick, president of We the People of Detroit, a human rights and water advocacy group.\n \u201cEven after the coronavirus pandemic has passed, we must work together to develop an affordable water structure that will allow those who\u2019ve been restored to maintain their water and access to proper sanitation,\u201d Lewis-Patrick says.\n Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0This article was updated to include a

"note_en": "For years, researchers have been attempting to build AI systems that can converse as well and naturally as humans. So far however, these efforts have only been successful in narrow, specialized and pre-programmed tasks.\n Three months ago Google released Meena, a neural-network-powered chatbot. Meena significantly outperformed other chatbots on Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA), an evaluation metric based on key elements of humanlike, multi-turn conversation.\n  \u201cThis is the first chatbot to blend a diverse set of conversational skills \u2014 including empathy, knowledge, and personality \u2014 together in one system,\u201d Facebook researchers boasted in a blog post.\n The researchers pitted Blender against Meena, determining \u201cin human evaluations of engagingness our best model outperforms Meena in a pairwise comparison 75 percent to 25 percent, and in terms of humanness by 65 percent to 35 percent.\u201d\n In an associated paper, the researchers summarize their approach for building such open-domain chatbots \u2014 including scale, blending skills, and generation strategies. \u201cWe achieved this milestone through a new chatbot recipe that includes improved decoding techniques, novel blending of skills, and a model with 9.4 billion parameters, which is 3.6x more than the largest existing system.\u201d\n The first step in Blender\u2019s creation was large-scale training. The team pretrained large Transformer neural networks on large amounts of conversational data and used previously available public domain conversations that involved 1.5 billion training examples of extracted conversations.\n They also introduced a novel Blended Skill Talk (BST) for training and evaluating desirable skills for Blender. Based on their previous research, the premise was that an ideal chatbot needs to be knowledgeable, have a personality, and be able to show empathy. Blending these skills however can be difficult because systems must be able to switch between different tasks when appropriate. The BST dataset provides a way to build systems that automatically and appropriately blend and exhibit these  ...\n Generation strategies such as beam search, next token sampling, and n-gram blocking are typically used after model training to ensure conversational agents don\u2019t repeat themselves or drop random words out of context. The researchers analyzed these generation strategies, determining for example that the length of an agent\u2019s utterances is particularly important in achieving better results with human evaluators.\n The researchers also noted that contrary to some recent research suggesting beam search is inferior to sampling, the choice of search hyperparameters can improve results by controlling trade-offs. \u201cIn particular, constraining the minimum beam length gives a crucial control of the dull versus spicy spectrum of responses.\u201d\n Despite the impressive performance achievements, the researchers stress much work remains in solving open-domain conversation. They are currently exploring ways to improve the models\u2019 conversational quality in longer conversations with new architectures and different loss functions.\n To encourage and assist in global conversational AI research, the team decided to release the complete model, code, and evaluation set-up to enable other AI researchers to reproduce, explore, and build on the work.\n The paper  Recipes for Building an Open-domain Chatbot is on  arXiv, and the code can be found  here.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:55:53", "tags": "facebook,\u673a\u5668\u4eba,blender,\u5bf9\u8bdd,researchers", "title": "Facebook\u79f0\u5176\u201c\u6405\u62cc\u673a\u201d\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u662f\u6709\u53f2\u4ee5\u6765\u6700\u4eba\u6027\u5316\u7684", "title_en": "Facebook Says Its \u2018Blender\u2019 Chatbot Is the Most Humanlike Ever", "transed": 0, "url": "https://medium.com/syncedreview/facebook-says-its-blender-chatbot-is-the-most-humanlike-ever-6b939d7de8df", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["facebook", "\u673a\u5668\u4eba", "blender", "\u5bf9\u8bdd"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "636ed93a2db31cbf282a4e3c2f853efa.jpg", "infoid": 1000169, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u603b\u7edf\u7279\u6717\u666e\u63d0\u51fa\u76842021\u5e74\u9884\u7b97\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8be5\u56fd\u706b\u661f\u63a2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5384\u8fd0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u8f86\u706b\u661f\u6f2b\u6e38\u8f66\u3002\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4f4d\u4e00\u518d\u6566\u4fc3\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u5c40(NASA)\u5411\u706b\u661f\u6d3e\u9063\u8f7d\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u603b\u7edf\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684\u4e3e\u52a8-\u751a\u81f3\u5411\u822a\u5929\u5c40\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u6765\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u636e\u201c\u79d1\u5b66\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u201d\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u62df\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u524a\u51cf\u5c06\u524a\u5f31\u51e0\u4e2a\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5173\u95ed\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u7684\u597d\u5947\u53f7\u6708\u7403\u8f66\uff0c\u8be5\u6708\u7403\u8f66\u81ea2012\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u706b\u661f\u3002\n\u8bb8\u591a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9884\u7b97\u8868\u793a\u5931\u671b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cNASA\u884c\u661f\u79d1\u5b66\u90e8\u4e3b\u4efbLori Glaze\u6301\u52a1\u5b9e\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\n\u201c\u53bb\u5e74\u9700\u8981\u505a\u51fa\u8bb8\u591a\u8270\u96be\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1a\u6295\u8d44\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u505a\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5728\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u67d0\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u201dGlaze\u544a\u8bc9SCIAM\u3002\u201c\u6240\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u90fd\u4f1a\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\u706b\u661f\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u201c\u3002\n\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u5bb6\u5219\u6301\u66f4\u4e3a\u6124\u4e16\u5ac9\u4fd7\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u3002\u4e54\u6cbb\u534e\u76db\u987f\u5927\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u5386\u53f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u517c\u653f\u7b56\u7814\u7a76\u5458\u7ea6\u7ff0\u00b7\u6d1b\u683c\u65af\u987f\u544a\u8bc9SECAM\uff0c\u524a\u51cf\u9884\u7b97\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u60e9\u7f5aNASA\u5728\u5176\u6bc5\u529b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u51fa\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u5c06\u8bd5\u56fe\u57282021\u5e74\u5728\u706b\u661f\u4e0a\u7740\u9646\u4e00\u8f86\u65b0\u7684\u6708\u7403\u8f66\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u571f\u58e4\u6837\u672c\u9001\u56de\u5730\u7403\u3002\nLogsdon\u544a\u8bc9SIPAM\uff1a\u201c\u5982\u679c\u8fd9\u79cd\u60e9\u7f5a\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u63a8\u8fdb\u706b\u661f\u6837\u672c\u8fd4\u56de\u52aa\u529b\u7684\u589e\u957f\u52bf\u5934\uff0c\u90a3\u5c06\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u77ed\u89c6\u7684\u3002\u201d\u201c\u5fc5\u987b\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9NASA\u79d1\u5b66\u52aa\u529b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5371\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7406\u7531\u3002\u201d", "note_en": "U.S. President Trump\u2019s proposed 2021 budget could spell doom for the country\u2019s Mars exploration missions, including its last Mars rover.\n It\u2019s an unusual move for a President who has  repeatedly urged NASA to send a crewed mission to Mars \u2014 and even offered the space agency  unlimited funding to do so.\n But the proposed budget cuts would debilitate several ongoing missions,   Scientific American  reports, and would even mean shutting down the iconic rover Curiosity, which has been exploring Mars since 2012.\n    Many scientists responded to the budget with dismay.

the Vision Fund, as the virus compounds woes at one of the firm\u2019s biggest bets.\n  The hit extends the group\u2019s expected net loss to 900 billion yen as investments made via the $100 billion fund sour, with the latest writedown illustrating how the group is racing to keep pace with the deteriorating value of its portfolio.\n \u201cEvery writedown takes Wework\u2019s carrying value closer to reality. Clearly the value is zero,\u201d said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Holdings.\n SoftBank is embroiled in a legal dispute with directors at WeWork after backing out of a $3 billion tender offer agreed when it bailed out the office-sharing firm following a flopped IPO attempt last year.\n The tech conglomerate has poured more than $13.5 billion into WeWork, one of a string of troubled bets by CEO Masayoshi Son that have laid waste to SoftBank\u2019s full-year earnings.\n The group maintained its forecast of a record annual operating loss of 1.35 trillion yen announced earlier this month.\n The darkening future for WeWork with customers in lockdown comes as deep-seated problems from SoftBank\u2019s cash-fuelled push for rapid expansion are being compounded by the coronavirus outbeak.\n SoftBank shares pared gains to close up 0.5% compared to a 2.1% rise in the benchmark index .N255. The group has launched a record 2.5 trillion yen buyback to support its share price. CEO Son uses his SoftBank shares as collateral for loans.\n The highly leveraged conglomerate has been forced into selling major assets to raise funds, but could receive a big boost from the Bank of Japan\u2019s plan to expand corporate bond buying, which would support its predilection for borrowing.\n SoftBank was sitting on around $160 billion of interest-bearing debt at the end of December and has seen yields on its bonds rise as high as 4.5% this month.\n Portfolio companies are continuing to retreat from a SoftBank-cash fuelled push for breakneck growth, with Indian hotel chain Oyo

"note_en": "April 2020  For 200 years, coal has powered the modern world. It was the prime fuel for the industrial revolution and along with hydropower, coal-burning technology  gave the world its first electric power plants. It has been essential in making steel, one of the main materials with which our modern world is literally built. It\u2019s hard to imagine the development of industrial civilization without coal.\n But it\u2019s dirty. Burning coal  releases nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and even mercury and lead into the air. It also produces giant piles of toxic ash, which can pollute waterways. And perhaps most significant of all, at the point of combustion coal is  one of the most carbon-intensive sources of electricity generation. When you factor in  coal mine methane releases, the life-cycle emissions of coal make it likely the worst fossil fuel for the climate.\n Because of this, a central goal of climate campaigners has been to reduce coal use and shutter coal-fired power plants, and most serious climate plans involve entirely phasing out coal in electricity generation as soon as feasible.\n But emissions are not the only problem with coal. The fuel is simply no longer the leader in low-cost power that it once was. In nations with shale gas deposits such as the United States, natural gas-fired generation is cheaper. And across the world, the continuously falling cost of solar and wind have made them less expensive forms of electricity than coal.\n With coal plants increasingly unable to compete in wholesale power markets, the number of hours that they run has fallen, meaning less revenue for plant owners. This has led to waves of coal plant closures over the last two decades in the United States and Europe. And with a global decline in demand for electricity due to economic restrictions imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, coal has been under even more pressure; a report released by the International Energy Agency  ...\n And yet despite this dismal economic picture, coal plants are still being built in large numbers, and the size of the global coal fleet continues to grow. According to an analysis by Carbon Tracker, 500 gigawatts of new coal-fired power plants\u2014roughly half the capacity of the entire US electric fleet\u2014are either under construction or planned across the world.\n    The crisis in the profitability of coal-fired power plants is not new. And it doesn\u2019t come from coal itself, or the technology used to turn the heat from burning coal into electricity. Instead, the challenge for coal is that other technologies have improved and become less expensive.\n Combined cycle gas technology, which uses a second turbine to capture the waste heat from the first turbine, has shown particular improvement. GE boasts  62 percent efficiency with its combined cycle gas plants using its H-Class turbines, while the efficiency of even the most advanced ultra-supercritical coal technology is  still below 50 percent.\n But the biggest advantage that gas has had is the development of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies. These have allowed gas producers to access previously unavailable gas deposits in shale leading to  a superabundant supply. This has meant sustained low prices in nations with shale gas deposits but has also freed up surplus gas for global liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets.\n This effect has been particularly profound in the United States. Coal had been the largest source of electricity generation for more than a century when gas eclipsed coal in 2015. Gas generated 38 percent of all  US electricity in 2019, compared to only 24 percent from coal.\n But the greatest long-term threat to coal comes from solar and wind, which have seen dramatic cost declines over the past two decades. For the second half of 2009, BloombergNEF\u2019s (BNEF) estimate for the global average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from onshore wind was US$111 per megawatt-hour (MWh), with offshore wind even higher at $190/MWh. For the first half of 2020 BNEF put these figures at $44 and $78/MWh, meaning that costs fell by more than half.\n The cost decline for solar photovoltaics (PV) was even more dramatic. Here costs fell from $347\u2013$362/MWh in the second half of 2009 (for fixed-tilt and tracking systems) to $39\u2013$50/MWh in the first half of 2020, which translates to costs being less than one-seventh what they were in 2009.\n Consultancy Lazard has  released similar figures, showing similar dramatic cost declines for solar and wind over the last decade. But while the costs of solar, wind, and gas have fallen, coal has stayed relatively steady.\n And in competitive wholesale power markets, solar and wind eat coal\u2019s lunch. With no fuel costs and only the long-term costs of building the plant and minimal operations and maintenance, there is no reason not to sell power from wind and solar plants, even when the price falls to zero. This is not the case for coal or gas-fired power plants, which must pay for fuel, and this has been particularly damning for coal during the current downturn in demand.\n    In March, London-based Carbon Tracker issued a new report,   How to Waste over Half a Trillion Dollars, which showed that it is cheaper to build solar and wind than new coal plants in every major geography. Even more significantly, it found that in some cases it was cheaper to build new wind or solar than to even keep running existing coal-fired power plants. And by 2030, the think tank found that this would be the case everywhere.\n These are radical findings, even for Carbon Tracker, which found that coal was much less competitive than was indicated by the  research it had published only sixteen months prior. Lazard has issued similar findings; its latest LCOE estimates put the global, unsubsidized cost of coal-fired power plants at US$66\u2013$152/MWh, roughly double that of combined-cycle gas plants, more than double the cost of wind, and nearly triple the cost of utility-scale solar.\n And this is not theory. Global coal demand peaked in 2013 and has been falling since. The subsequent fall in prices has hit the highest-cost producers the hardest, with devastating impacts on the US and Polish coal sectors. In the United States, the blow has been particularly hard, with both a massive reduction in domestic demand and low prices for export. As a result, the US coal industry has seen wave after wave of bankruptcies.\n As the COVID-19 pandemic reduces both industrial and electric demand, coal is under even more pressure. Because buying the coal as fuel makes up much of the cost of coal-fired power, coal plants are some of the first to turn off when power demand falls. The US Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Agency is predicting a 20 percent fall in electricity generation from coal this year, while coal prices plunge even further.\n    And despite all of these economic cases against coal, more coal-fired capacity is put online every year than is retired, with the result that there is a greater capacity in coal-fired power plants this year than at any time in history. But this fact conceals profound regional differences.\n Coal plants are increasingly going offline in Europe and not being replaced at the same rate. In the United States, no coal plants have been built for several years. Additionally, several nations have set phase-out dates for coal. Coal-fired power has disappeared or nearly disappeared in some nations and regions, including Austria and Sweden; in both nations  the last coal-fired power plant shut off in April.\n In Asia, it is a different story. India, Turkey, multiple nations in Southeast Asia, and especially China are building dozens of gigawatts of new coal plants, and this has more than made up for the retirements in Europe and North America.\n    It is not an accident that most coal plants are being built in the developing world. In more affluent nations, electricity demand is flat or declining. But in the developing world there is a need for more electricity to power growing economies: more people and more wealth. \u201cWhen you are a country that is looking for steep economic growth and you already have an infrastructure that is built around fossil fuels, it might seem easier to do it that way, \u201dexplains  ...\n And in nations without domestic gas reserves, imported LNG is unlikely to be able to compete with coal\u2014even if those nations have the infrastructure to import LNG. Furthermore, in many nations there are incentives for coal-fired power plants, which distort the raw economics.\n Indonesia has the third-largest fleet of coal-fired power plants currently under construction, which Global Energy Monitor puts at just under 12 GW. Lauri Myllyvirta, the lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CRECA) notes that it is also one of the nations that most heavily subsidizes electricity generation from coal. Not only are coal producers required to sell a portion of the coal they mine at a discount to domestic power plants,  ...\n However, Indonesia is not unique, and Myllyvirta notes that similar dynamics play out in Turkey, India, China and other developing nations that mine coal. \u201cIf you look at the countries that still have coal-fired power pipelines, it is by and large countries with a domestic coal mining industry,\u201d explains Myllyvirta. \u201cIt is about creating demand for that domestic industry.\u201d\n    As far as the energy transition goes, China represents a paradox. The nation has grown the amount of renewable energy that it puts online every year much faster than its Western counterparts,  growing wind and solar generation 12-fold over the last decade.\n However, the nation\u2019s ever-growing appetite for more electricity to power its expanding economy means that China\u2019s raw consumption of coal has been on a growth path over the last decade. This is happening even as renewable energy takes up a larger portion of its power mix, and as the share of coal in primary energy consumption has fallen from 74 percent in 2013 to 58 percent in 2019.\n According to the analysis by Carbon Tracker, China has the largest capacity of coal-fired generation under construction of any nation on earth, at nearly 100 gigawatts. The think tank identified another 106 GW of plants that are being planned after that, which translates to roughly 40 percent of the total underway globally.\n And yet Carbon Tracker\u2019s analysis shows that on a long-term basis of power delivered, new wind and solar are cheaper sources of power than new coal. BNEF agrees, and its latest LCOE estimates show solar as the cheapest form of new electricity in China at US$38/MWh; although this figure conceals significant regional differences in cost.\n So why is China building all of these coal plants? There are several factors. First, unlike petroleum or gas, coal is domestically produced. That means that coal is not only seen as a means to energy security and less dependence on imports, but as the world\u2019s largest coal producer there are millions of Chinese workers employed in the coal sector, from mining to running power plants.\n \u201cCoal has been seen as the only self-sufficient industry here in China,\u201d explains Xiang Li, the manager of RMI China\u2019s power initiative. \u201cEverything here in the power sector was constructed with coal as the cornerstone.\u201d\n Policy decisions have a role as well. While China has passed a number of policies to prioritize renewable energy, some also have benefitted coal. In 2014, authority for permitting was transferred from the central government to the provincial level, and over the next two years local governments permitted dozens of gigawatts of coal-fired power plants.\n In 2016, China\u2019s central government began  issuing a series of restrictions on coal-fired power plants. However, many of the coal plants which were permitted or proposed during the 2014\u20132016 period are being built today.\n These new projects are coming into a power market where there is significant overcapacity, with utilization rates for the nation\u2019s coal fleet  falling to only 50 percent. However, the provincial governments approving these plants have even stronger economic reasons to do so than they do to build solar factories. \u201cEvery province has an incentive to improve its GDP,\u201d notes RMI\u2019s Li. \u201cThey are fully aware of the overcapacity situation.\u201d\n The raw numbers here also conceal a geographic shift. Li notes that in recent years the more affluent, urbanized provinces have been tightening air control rules, leading to the shutdown of coal-fired power plants near large cities. Meanwhile, the central government is prioritizing coal-fired power plants in the more rural provinces of Western China, near where the coal is mined.\n China is engaged in not only expanding its domestic coal fleet, but also funding overseas projects. Even as many Western banks have stopped financing coal-fired power plants, Chinese banks are currently  financing nearly 40 GW of coal projects, many of which are in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Africa. This is led by state-run banks, with the Export-Import Bank of China, the China Development Bank, and the Bank of China as the three largest  ...\n Japanese banks are also  funding nearly 20 GW of coal-fired power plants. In both cases the motivation for doing so may be in part to support domestic industries; CRECA\u2019s Myllyvirta notes that China exports both coal and machinery while Japanese companies often make the power plants themselves.\n    Every investment in a power plant is a bet on future power prices. However, Carbon Tracker says that in many cases, the institutions investing in coal-fired power are looking at short-term profitability. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of not thinking long term,\u201d states Carbon Tracker\u2019s Sundaresan. \u201c10 years can seem a long time away, if you are looking at an investment that might bring in returns in the short term.\u201d\n There is also some debate about the economics. While Carbon Tracker, BNEF and Lazard put the cost of new wind and solar below that of coal-fired power in most or all of the world, the IEA\u2019s World Energy Outlook put the LCOE of coal-fired power at only $50 per megawatt-hour in China in 2018, below the cost of either solar or wind (each at $60/MWh).\n IEA\u2019s assumptions for its LCOE are different than those used by BNEF, Carbon Tracker or Lazard, and these appear to be consistently more favorable to coal. As one example, IEA estimates a 70 percent capacity factor for new Chinese coal plants, which is far above the current fleet-wide utilization rate.\n Additionally, IEA\u2019s cost estimates for new wind and solar plants are much higher than those produced by BNEF or Lazard. However, given the global clout of IEA these LCOE figures may be leading institutions and other investors to see a future for coal-fired power.\n It may be one that does not materialize. While there is more capacity in power plants to burn coal for electricity than there ever was, we aren \u2019t burning as much coal in those plants. Even with demand rising in the developing world, global coal use peaked in 2013 and has been essentially flat since then. And with these two trends, the number of hours that coal-fired power plants are used has fallen not only in China, but also globally.  ...\n    Carbon Tracker has warned that despite mechanisms to protect the investments of state-owned banks, China is still at risk of stranded assets. \u201cChina is prioritizing growth targets, energy security and coal-related jobs over project viability, \u201dnotes Carbon Tracker \u2019s Sundaresan. She warns that lowering risk ratings for coal-powered capacity could be dangerous. \u201cMore capacity will be constructed, creating potential overcapacity and  ...\n Carbon Tracker is warning of an \u201cextreme\u201d risk of stranded coal assets not only in China, but also in India, the European Union, and the United States. In each of these regions, the think tank estimates that at least 45 percent of the coal-fired capacity costs more to operate than installing new renewable energy today, and that all of it will cost more by 2030.\n    It is important to note that new coal-fired power plants are already having economic trouble in some markets. In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India  identified a number of coal-fired power plants as \u201cnon-performing assets.\u201d Furthermore, as of May 2019, 19 GW of Indian coal-fired power plants that were being built  have been halted for two or more years, with the Global Energy Monitor identifying financial issues as a factor in most  ...\n And while India has seen a particularly steep fall in its pipeline of new projects, the cancellation of coal-fired power plants is a global issue. Despite net capacity additions of coal-fired power plants rising globally in 2019 for the first time in five years, the preconstruction pipeline shrank, as did construction starts. Overall, the capacity of coal-fired power plants under construction fell 16 percent from 2018 to 2019.  ...\n It is important to note that the slowing trend in new coal projects does not put us anywhere near the goals of the Paris Agreement, which would require an 80 percent decline in coal-fired generation by 2030. But some nations are taking a more active role. South Korea is the third-largest financier of overseas coal projects, and the incoming ruling party has  vowed to stop funding coal plants as part of its Green New Deal.\n Yet even as some plants are canceled, others are still moving forward. For those who continue to fund new coal-fired power plants, there is a tremendous amount of capital at risk, which Carbon Tracker puts at $638 billion. This could have major repercussions not only for individual investors, but for banks in China, Japan and other nations.\n We are walking into a disaster of epic proportions, both for climate and for the economies that are tied to coal. There is still time to turn this around, and it will require funders and governments to take a serious look at the risks that they are taking.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:55:41", "tags":

Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators, including FAS Dean Claudine Gay.  By  Ryan N. Gajarawala\n     Harvard\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Sciences placed Mathematics and Biology professor Martin A. Nowak on paid administrative leave Friday after a review into Harvard\u2019s ties to Jeffrey E. Epstein found extensive and previously unreported contact between the professor and the convicted sex offender, FAS Dean Claudine Gay wrote in an email to affiliates Friday afternoon.\n A University report found Epstein attempted to use Harvard and the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, which Nowak directs, as a tool to rehabilitate his image following his 2008 conviction for solicitation of minors for prostitution. Epstein likely made more than 40 visits to PED \u2019s offices at One Brattle Square between 2010 and 2018, according to the report, which also states that Nowak approved the posting of flattering and false descriptions of Epstein \u2019s philanthropy and support of Harvard  ...\n University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced in a separate message Friday that the Office of General Counsel and outside law firm Foley Hoag have completed their review into Epstein\u2019s connections to Harvard.\n The review found that no donations were made by Epstein following a decision by former University President Drew G. Faust to refuse donations from Epstein after his conviction.\n Gay wrote in her email that the FAS \u201cfully supports\u201d the recommendations of the General Counsel\u2019s report. The report raises several questions about violations of FAS policies, which Gay wrote in her email will be investigated.\n \u201cThe actions taken by the head of PED, Professor Martin Nowak, as described in the report warrant review to determine whether FAS policies and standards of professional conduct were violated and if additional steps must be taken,\u201d Gay wrote. \u201cTo that end, Professor Nowak has been placed on paid administrative leave.\u201d\n \u201cWe do not take this step lightly, but the seriousness of the matter leads us to believe it is not appropriate for Professor Nowak to continue in his role, other than what he will be asked to do to complete the semester, while the FAS determines its response to the findings of the report,\u201d Gay added.\n  The Crimson reported in 2006 that Epstein donated $6.5 million to the program in 2003, which Friday\u2019s report concluded was by far the largest single donation Epstein made to Harvard. The report found no additional donations to PED after Epstein\u2019s conviction and Faust\u2019s subsequent decision to bar donations from him.\n  In 2005, professor Stephen M. Kosslyn, now emeritus, named Epstein a visiting fellow in the Psychology department, Bacow wrote in an email  announcing the review last September. According to Friday\u2019s report, Epstein \u2014 who did not hold an undergraduate degree \u2014 was not qualified for the research he applied to conduct, nor did he conduct much of that research during his two-year appointment.\n An administrator in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences had recommended that GSAS not admit Epstein as a Visiting Fellow, but his application was approved anyway, per the report.\n  PED also provided Epstein with an office and keycode access to its building, which he maintained even after he vacated his visiting fellowship. The report found no evidence that Epstein interacted with Harvard students during his approximately 40 visits, though he did attend one of Nowak\u2019s undergraduate math classes.\n Even though Epstein did not donate to PED or Harvard after 2007, he played an \u201cindirect but significant role\u201d in facilitating a grant from the John Templeton Foundation to PED in 2015.\n Epstein died in prison last August, facing federal charges that he trafficked and sexually assaulted underage girls. The Miami Herald reported in November 2018 that Epstein operated a sex ring out of his Palm Beach, Fla. home and identified around 80 women who say Epstein molested or sexually abused them before 2006.\n \u2014Staff writer James S.

"note_en": "A head of procurement for the  NHS has set up a business to profit from the private sale of huge quantities of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, an undercover investigation by the Guardian can reveal.\n David Singleton, 42, a senior NHS official in London who has been working at the capital\u2019s Covid-19 Nightingale hospital, launched the business two weeks ago to trade in visors, masks and gowns.\n Asked about the findings of the investigation, Singleton said he disclosed his business to superiors in the NHS, in accordance with the rules, and was told there was \u201cunlikely to be a conflict\u201d.\n However, the NHS launched an immediate investigation. \u201cWe take any potential conflicts of interest extremely seriously and as soon we became aware of these allegations an internal investigation was started,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n A website for Singleton\u2019s company, Sure Stock, which marketed PPE to private sector and NHS clients, made no reference to Singleton or his role in the health service. But in a phone call with an undercover reporter posing as a potential client, Singleton confirmed he was running the business. He said he was trading as a \u201csales agent\u201d between suppliers and buyers of PPE.\n  According to Singleton\u2019s LinkedIn profile, which he deleted shortly after the Guardian told him about its investigation, he is a head of procurement for the NHS in London. He works within a large commissioning support unit (CSU) that covers the capital\u2019s north and east and surrounding areas. It is understood the investigation is being conducted by his employer, the NHS north and east London CSU.\n During the conversation with the undercover reporter, Singleton said he was \u201ccurrently an NHS employee\u201d but said his role did not involve buying \u201cany products\u201d. \u201cI deliver services,\u201d he said. \u201cSo none of the suppliers that I\u2019m working with do I have any interactions with during my day job.\u201d\n Asked later whether he was exploiting his NHS expertise and contacts, Singleton said in a statement that he was not \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in responding to  the PPE shortage in the NHS \u201cas my role does not involve purchasing or procuring of these products\u201d.\n However, information collated by the Guardian, including internal NHS email evidence, suggests Singleton may have been involved in procuring PPE supplies. Asked to respond to a request for comment about the email evidence, Singleton replied \u201cno comment\u201d and hung up the phone. The NHS declined to comment on the email evidence.\n  Singleton created his PPE company on 15 April, as the shortage of protective equipment for NHS and other health and care workers working on the frontline of the coronavirus outbreak was reaching crisis point.\n His company, Sure Stock Limited, originally registered to Singleton\u2019s home in Essex, launched a website that same week, marketing PPE products for \u201cmedical, dental, adult social care, the food industry and personal use\u201d.\n The website offered large amounts of PPE and hygiene products for sale, including protective face shields, or \u201csmart visors\u201d, which were priced at \u00a319,500 for minimum orders of 10,000 units.\n  Posing as an agent for a meat processing factory, a Guardian reporter approached Sure Stock claiming his client urgently needed large quantities of PPE to protect about 800 workers and return the facility to full production.\n Sure Stock\u2019s salesperson, a friend and associate of Singleton, confirmed the company had been created by Singleton and said he could help source batches of 20,000 visors, masks, gowns and gloves \u2013 as well as 1,000 litres of hand sanitiser \u2013 as part of an initial order. The sale would have totalled more than \u00a3100,000.\n The salesperson told the undercover reporter: \u201cEssentially a friend of mine is head of procurement for NHS London. He has really struggled to get stuff to people in the right timeframe. So essentially what we decided to do was set up a little company and become sales agents for people in the UK who have got stock. And then essentially we would help in linking up the supply chains that are massively disastrous at the moment.\u201d\n The undercover reporter then asked to talk to Singleton directly. During a 40-minute telephone conversation, Singleton told the undercover reporter: \u201cWhat we do is we work with the supplier and then our margin, our commission, our referral, comes from them before the prices go out. So we just work as a sales agent.\u201d\n He also disclosed he was an NHS employee. \u201cWe want to nurture relationships like yours. Because people like you can open doors for some of my suppliers into areas that they don\u2019t currently reach into,\u201d he told the undercover reporter. \u201cSo it\u2019s growing a network of trusted suppliers and buyers because you can\u2019t be a supplier unless you\u2019ve got a buyer. You can\u2019t be a buyer unless you\u2019ve got a supplier. You need to have these things. You need to connect up.\u201d\n  Towards the end of the call, Singleton emphasised how competitive his visor prices were and encouraged the undercover reporter to \u201cpiggyback\u201d a large order \u201ccurrently \u2026 going through with the Far East [and a UK importer]\u201d. He added: \u201cWhat I\u2019d close off by saying is when you are in a position where you know you want to place an order, rest assured that you are going to be dealing with a UK company.\u201d\n Singleton told the undercover reporter that during the Covid-19 outbreak he had been \u201credeployed\u201d to the Nightingale hospital at the Excel Centre and the Royal London hospital and was \u201chelping them set up their pop-up ITU [intensive treatment unit] wards and their stock rooms\u201d.\n In his statement to the Guardian following the undercover investigation, Singleton said he had not set up ITUs or stock rooms and had not been involved in any procurement at the the hospital.\n He said he had notified his employer about Sure Stock, as is required, and had been informed by a superior that \u201cthere is unlikely to be a conflict\u201d, as it was perceived there would be no crossover in terms of customers. Singleton said declaring the directorship was the main step towards compliance and this had been completed.\n However, the Guardian understands that while Singleton recently declared his new business via an internal online NHS reporting system, the disclosure was under review and had not yet been approved.\n In his conversation with the undercover reporter, Singleton\u2019s salesperson appeared to give conflicting accounts of whether or not the firm planned to market to the NHS. At one point he said: \u201cWe\u2019re not really wanting to approach anyone in the NHS, because there is a bit of conflict of interest, so we are sort of staying out of that.\u201d\n But during another part of the conversation, about the scarcity of gowns on the market, the salesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of NHS trusts frantically phoning around trying to get hold of these and they can\u2019t.\u201d He added: \u201cNow what we are doing with those, we are offering the NHS 30 days to pay.\u201d\n  In his emailed statement, Singleton said Sure Stock \u201chas not and will not sell PPE and related equipment to the NHS, or any NHS organisation\u201d. He added: \u201cAny such allegation is false\u201d.\n However, a photograph on Sure Stock\u2019s website advertising face shields showed a visor with the NHS logo printed on the front, and the company offered deals for NHS clients. \u201cFor our NHS heroes your price is fixed!\u201d the website stated.\n In his statement, Singleton said the face shields have not been sold to the NHS because they did not meet the complex medical devices regulations which govern the manufacture and supply of such products.\n Sure Stock\u2019s website was mothballed shortly after Singleton was contacted by the Guardian for comment. It now just states: \u201c Coming soon\u201d.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:55:33", "tags": "\u91c7\u8d2d,procurement,nhs", "title":

"note_en": "Recently I got bored of wrinting frontend at work every day. I\u2019ve decided to try some lower level stuff.I\u2019ve heard a lot of people talking about this new great architecture called RISC-V and I\u2019ve always liked low level stuff, so I\u2019ve decided to play around with it.\n As the name suggests RISC-V is a risc architecture, It only has a few instructions and is designed to be extensible. You can do everything with the base implementation but since it\u2019s so limited, most implementation use extensions to add additional functionality(like integer multiplication). The list of extensions can be found  here. This makes the ISA really simple to implement and to implement software for it.\n In this post I will explain what is needed to get from assembly to c and print a  hello world message.\n  When a RISC-V cpu starts all its harts(hardware threads) start executing code from the address  0x80000000. In theory we could just write to the UART address to get things on the screen but since I don\u2019t like writing lots of assembly lets first jump to C and then display our message. To jump to C we need to setup the stack and park all the harts but one. The whole assembly code that setups stacks for each hart and parks not needed harts looks like this:\n .equ STACK_SIZE, 1024.global _start_start: # setup stacks per hart csrr t0, mhartid # read current hart id slli t0, t0, 10 # shift left the hart id by 1024 la sp, stacks + STACK_SIZE # set the initial stack pointer # to the end of the stack space add sp, sp, t0 # move the current hart stack pointer # to its place in the stack space # park harts with id != 0 csrr a0, mhartid # read current hart id bnez a0, park # if we&#39;re not on the hart 0 # we park the hart j enter # jump to cpark: wfi j  ...\n In the liker script we tell the linker to put the  _start symbol at  0x80000000, the  enter symbol is our entry point in C.\n  Awesome! we\u2019re in C, because we\u2019re going to use qemu to run the code the easiest way to get IO is to use UART, It\u2019s quite a big standart and I could write a whole post about it but for now we only need to know that according to qemu  source it\u2019s memory mapped at address  0x10000000 and writing to it will make things appear on the screen.\n UART has some registers for controlling it for now we only care about the line status register(or LSR) located at offset  0x05 from the base uart address(the full list of register can be found  here).The LSR can tell us whether we can write data the the UART buffer, the possible values of this register are  here\n  static  int  putchar ( uint8_t  ch )  {  static  uint8_t  THR  =  0x00 ;  static  uint8_t  LSR  =  0x05 ;  static  uint8_t  LSR_RI  =  0x40 ;  while  (( uart [ LSR ]  &amp;  LSR_RI )  ==  0 );  return  uart [ THR ]  =  ch ; }\n The uart variable is globally defined as  volatile so that the compiler doesn\u2019t try to optimize it out.\n  Because this code only writes a single character we need to create a helper function to write whole lines.\n  Now we can call  puts and hopefully we should see stuff appear on the screen:\n   typedef  unsigned  char  uint8_t ; static  volatile  uint8_t  * uart  =  ( void  * ) 0x10000000 ; static  int  putchar ( char  ch )  {  static  uint8_t  THR  =  0x00 ;  static  uint8_t  LSR  =  0x05 ;  static  uint8_t  LSR_RI  =  0x40 ;  while  (( uart [ LSR ]  &amp;  LSR_RI )  ==  0 );  return  uart [ THR ]  =  ch ; } void  puts ( char  * s )  {  while  ( * s )  putchar ( * s ++ );  putchar ( &#39;\\n&#39; ); } void  enter ()  {  puts ( &#34;Hello RISC-V&#34; ); }\n We can compile it using gcc  riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32 -T default.lds -o out -nostdlib -fno-builtin start.s main.cThe  start.s is our assembly source and the  main.c is our c code\n This should produce a file called  out which can be run using qemu:  qemu-system-riscv32 -nographic -smp 4 -machine virt -bios none -kernel out\n  This might not be much but It\u2019s a good start, for writing a whole kernel. In the future I\u2019d love to cover things like: interrupts memory management, unprivilaged ISA.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:55:25", "tags": "risc,adventures,uart", "title":

"note_en": "Sure, don&#39;t hoard toilet paper \u2013 but if policymakers fear fear itself, they&#39;ll downplay real dangers to avoid &#34;mass panic&#34;. Fear&#39;s not the problem, it&#39;s how we  channel our fear. Fear gives us energy to deal with dangers now, and prepare for dangers later.\n  Honestly, we (Marcel, epidemiologist + Nicky, art/code) are worried. We bet you are, too! That&#39;s why we&#39;ve channelled our fear into making these  playable simulations, so that  you can channel your fear into understanding:\n    This guide (published May 1st, 2020. click this footnote!\u2192  1) is meant to give you hope  and fear. To beat COVID-19  in a way that also protects our mental &amp; financial health, we need optimism to create plans, and pessimism to create backup plans. As Gladys Bronwyn Stern once said,  \u201cThe optimist invents the airplane and the pessimist the parachute.\u201d\n          So, let&#39;s make a very,  very simple &#34;epidemic flight simulator&#34;! In this simulation,   Infectious people can turn   Susceptible people into more   Infectious people:\n    It&#39;s estimated that,  at the start of a COVID-19 outbreak, the virus jumps from an   to an   every 4 days,  on average.  2 (remember, there&#39;s a lot of variation)\n  If we simulate &#34;double every 4 days&#34;  and nothing else, on a population starting with just 0.001%  , what happens?\n  Click &#34;Start&#34; to play the simulation! You can re-play it later with different settings: (technical caveats:   3)\n    This is the  exponential growth curve. Starts small, then explodes. &#34;Oh it&#39;s just a flu&#34; to &#34;Oh right, flus don&#39;t create  mass graves in rich cities&#34;.\n    But, this simulation is wrong. Exponential growth, thankfully, can&#39;t go on forever. One thing that stops a virus from spreading is if others  already have the virus:\n    The more  s there are, the faster  s become  s,  but the fewer  s there are, the  slower  s become  s.\n        But, this simulation is  still wrong. We&#39;re missing the fact that   Infectious people eventually stop being infectious, either by 1) recovering, 2) &#34;recovering&#34; with lung damage, or 3) dying.\n  For simplicity&#39;s sake, let&#39;s pretend that all   Infectious people become   Recovered. (Just remember that in reality, some are dead.)  s can&#39;t be infected again, and let&#39;s pretend \u2013  for now! \u2013 that they stay immune for life.\n  With COVID-19, it&#39;s estimated you&#39;re   Infectious for 10 days,  on average.  4 That means some folks will recover before 10 days, some after.  Here&#39;s what that looks like, with a simulation  starting with 100%  :\n            Red curve is  current cases  ,   Gray curve is  total cases (current + recovered  ),\tstarts at just 0.001%  :\n    And  that&#39;s where that famous curve comes from! It&#39;s not a bell curve, it&#39;s not even a &#34;log-normal&#34; curve. It has no name. But you&#39;ve seen it a zillion times, and beseeched to flatten.\n  This is the the  SIR Model,  5 \t(  Susceptible   Infectious   Recovered) \tthe  second-most important idea in Epidemiology 101:\n    NOTE: The simulations that inform policy are way,  way more sophisticated than this! But the SIR Model can still explain the same general findings, even if missing the nuances.\n  Actually, let&#39;s add one more nuance: before an   becomes an  , they first become   Exposed. This is when they have the virus but can&#39;t pass it on yet \u2013 infect ed but not yet infect ious.\n    (This variant is called the  SEIR Model  6, where the &#34;E&#34; stands for   &#34;Exposed&#34;. Note this  isn&#39;t the everyday meaning of &#34;exposed&#34;, when you may or may not have the virus. In this technical definition, &#34;Exposed&#34; means you definitely have it. Science terminology is bad.)\n  For COVID-19, it&#39;s estimated that you&#39;re   infected-but-not-yet-infectious for 3 days,  on average.  7 What happens if we add that to the simulation?\n  Red  + Pink curve is  current cases (infectious   + exposed  ),   Gray curve is  total cases (current + recovered  ):\n    Not much changes! How long you stay   Exposed changes the ratio of  -to- , and  when current cases peak... but the  height of that peak, and total cases in the end, stays the same.\n      Short for &#34;Reproduction number&#34;. It&#39;s the  average number of people an   infects  before they recover (or die).\n    R changes over the course of an outbreak, as we get more immunity &amp; interventions.\n  R 0 (pronounced R-nought) is what R is  at the start of an outbreak, before immunity or interventions. R 0 more closely reflects the power of the virus itself, but it still changes from place to place. For example, R 0 is higher in dense cities than sparse rural areas.\n  (Most news articles \u2013 and even some research papers! \u2013 confuse R and R 0. Again, science terminology is bad)\n  The R 0 for &#34;the&#34; seasonal flu is around 1.28  8. This means, at the  start of a flu outbreak, each   infects 1.28 others  on average. (If it sounds weird that this isn&#39;t a whole number, remember that the &#34;average&#34; mom has 2.4 children. This doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s half-children running about.)\n  The R 0 for COVID-19 is estimated to be around 2.2,  9 though one  not-yet-finalized study estimates it was 5.7(!) in Wuhan.  10\n  In our simulations \u2013  at the start &amp; on average \u2013 an   infects someone every 4 days, over 10 days. &#34;4 days&#34; goes into &#34;10 days&#34; two-and-a-half times. This means \u2013  at the start &amp; on average \u2013 each   infects 2.5 others. Therefore, R 0 = 2.5. (caveats:  11)\n  Play with this R 0 calculator, to see how R 0 depends on recovery time &amp; new-infection time:\n    But remember, the fewer  s there are, the  slower  s become  s. The  current reproduction number (R) depends not just on the  basic reproduction number (R 0), but  also on how many people are no longer   Susceptible. (For example, by recovering &amp; getting natural immunity.)\n    When enough people have immunity, R &lt; 1, and the virus is contained! This is called  herd immunity. For flus, herd immunity is achieved  with a vaccine. Trying to achieve &#34;natural herd immunity&#34; by letting folks get infected is a  terrible idea. (But not for the reason you may think! We&#39;ll explain later.)\n  Now, let&#39;s play the SEIR Model again, but showing R 0, R over time, and the herd immunity threshold:\n    NOTE: Total cases  does not stop at herd immunity, but overshoots it! And it crosses the threshold  exactly when current cases peak. (This happens no matter how you change the settings \u2013 try it for yourself!)\n  This is because when there are more non- s than the herd immunity threshold, you get R &lt; 1. And when R &lt; 1, new cases stop growing: a peak.\n  If there&#39;s only one lesson you take away from this guide, here it is \u2013 it&#39;s an extremely complex diagram so please take time to fully absorb it:\n    This means: we do NOT need to catch all transmissions, or even nearly all transmissions, to stop COVID-19!\n  It&#39;s a paradox. COVID-19 is extremely contagious, yet to contain it, we &#34;only&#34; need to stop more than 60% of infections. 60%?! If that was a school grade, that&#39;s a D-. But if R 0 = 2.5, cutting that by 61% gives us R = 0.975, which is R &lt; 1, virus is contained! (exact formula:  12)\n    (If you think R 0 or the other numbers in our simulations are too low/high, that&#39;s good you&#39;re challenging our assumptions! There&#39;ll be a &#34;Sandbox Mode&#34; at the end of this guide, where you can plug in your  own numbers, and simulate what happens.)\n  Every COVID-19 intervention you&#39;ve heard of \u2013 handwashing, social/physical distancing, lockdowns, self-isolation, contact tracing &amp; quarantining, face masks, even &#34;herd immunity&#34; \u2013 they&#39;re  all doing the same thing:\n    So now, let&#39;s use our &#34;epidemic flight simulator&#34; to figure this out: How can we get R &lt; 1 in a way  that also protects our mental health  and financial health?\n          Around 1 in 20 people infected with COVID-19 need to go to an ICU (Intensive Care Unit).  13 In a rich country like the USA, there&#39;s 1 ICU bed per 3400 people.  14 Therefore, the USA can handle 20 out of 3400 people being  simultaneously infected \u2013 or, 0.6% of the population.\n  Even if we  more than tripled that capacity to 2%, here&#39;s what would&#39;ve happened  if we did absolutely nothing:\n      That&#39;s what  the March 16 Imperial College report found: do nothing, and we run out of ICUs, with more than 80% of the population getting infected. \t(remember: total cases  overshoots herd immunity)\n  Even if only 0.5% of infected die \u2013 a generous assumption when there&#39;s no more ICUs \u2013 in a large country like the US, with 300 million people, 0.5% of 80% of 300 million = still 1.2 million dead...  IF we did nothing.\n  (Lots of news &amp; social media reported &#34;80% will be infected&#34;  without &#34;IF WE DO NOTHING&#34;. Fear was channelled into clicks, not understanding.  Sigh.)\n    The &#34;Flatten The Curve&#34; plan was touted by every public health organization, while the United Kingdom&#39;s original &#34;herd immunity&#34; plan was universally booed. They were  the same plan. The UK just communicated theirs poorly.  15\n    First, let&#39;s look at the two main ways to &#34;flatten the curve&#34;: handwashing &amp; physical distancing.\n  Increased handwashing cuts flus &amp; colds in high-income countries by ~25%  16, while the city-wide lockdown in London cut close contacts by ~70%  17. So, let&#39;s assume handwashing can reduce R by  up to 25%, and distancing can reduce R by  up to 70%:\n  Play with this calculator to see how % of non- , handwashing, and distancing reduce R: (this calculator visualizes their  relative effects, which is why increasing one  looks like it decreases the effect of the others.  18)\n    Now, let&#39;s simulate what happens to a COVID-19 epidemic if, starting March 2020, we had increased handwashing but only  mild physical distancing \u2013 so that R is lower, but still above 1:\n      This  reduces total cases!  Even if you don&#39;t get R &lt; 1, reducing R still saves lives, by reducing the &#39;overshoot&#39; above herd immunity. Lots of folks think &#34;Flatten The Curve&#34; spreads out cases without reducing the total. This is impossible in  anyEpidemiology 101 model. But because the news reported &#34;80%+ will be infected&#34;  ...\n  Due to the extra interventions, current cases peak  before herd immunity is reached. In fact, in this simulation, total cases only overshoots  a tiny bit above herd immunity \u2013 the UK&#39;s plan! At that point, R &lt; 1, you can let go of all other interventions, and COVID-19 stays contained! Well, except for one problem...\n  You still run out of ICUs. For several months. (and remember, we  already tripled ICUs for these simulations)\n  That was the other finding of the March 16 Imperial College report, which convinced the UK to abandon its original plan. Any attempt at  mitigation (reduce R, but R &gt; 1) will fail. The only way out is  suppression (reduce R so that R &lt; 1).\n        Let&#39;s see what happens if we  crush the curve with a 5-month lockdown, reduce   to nearly nothing, then finally \u2013  finally \u2013 return to normal life:\n      This is the &#34;second wave&#34; everyone&#39;s talking about. As soon as we remove the lockdown, we get R &gt; 1 again. So, a single leftover   (or imported  ) can cause a spike in cases that&#39;s almost as bad as if we&#39;d done Scenario 0: Absolutely Nothing.\n        This solution was first suggested by the March 16 Imperial College report, and later again by a Harvard paper.  19\n  Here&#39;s a simulation: (After playing the &#34;recorded scenario&#34;, you can try simulating your  own lockdown schedule, by changing the sliders  while the simulation is running! Remember you can pause &amp; continue the sim, and change the simulation speed)\n    This  would keep cases below ICU capacity! And it&#39;s  much better than an 18-month lockdown until a vaccine is available. We just need to... shut down for a few months, open up for a few months, and repeat until a vaccine is available. (And if there&#39;s no vaccine, repeat until herd immunity is reached... in 2022.)\n  Look, it&#39;s nice to draw a line saying &#34;ICU capacity&#34;, but there&#39;s lots of important things we  can&#39;t simulate here. Like:\n  Mental Health: Loneliness is one of the biggest risk factors for depression, anxiety, and suicide. And it&#39;s as associated with an early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.  20\n  Financial Health:&#34;What about the economy&#34; sounds like you care more about dollars than lives, but &#34;the economy&#34; isn&#39;t just stocks: it&#39;s people&#39;s ability to provide food &amp; shelter for their loved ones, to invest in their kids&#39; futures, and enjoy arts, foods, videogames \u2013the stuff that makes life  ...\n  Not saying we  shouldn&#39;t lock down again! We&#39;ll look at &#34;circuit breaker&#34; lockdowns later. Still, it&#39;s not ideal.\n  But wait... haven&#39;t Taiwan and South Korea  already contained COVID-19? For 4 whole months,  without long-term lockdowns?\n      &#34;Sure, we *could&#39;ve* done what Taiwan &amp; South Korea did at the start, but it&#39;s too late now. We missed the start.&#34;\n  But that&#39;s exactly it! \u201cA lockdown isn&#39;t a cure, it&#39;s just a restart\u201d...  and a fresh start is what we need.\n  To understand how Taiwan &amp; South Korea contained COVID-19, we need to understand the exact timeline of a typical COVID-19 infection  21:\n    If cases only self-isolate when they know they&#39;re sick (that is, they feel symptoms), the virus can still spread:\n      But, if we find  and quarantine a symptomatic case&#39;s recent close contacts... we stop the spread, by staying one step ahead!\n    This is called  contact tracing. It&#39;s an old idea, was used at an unprecedented scale to contain Ebola  23, and now it&#39;s core part of how Taiwan &amp; South Korea are containing COVID-19!\n  (It also lets us use our limited tests more efficiently, to find pre-symptomatic  s without needing to test almost everyone.)\n  Traditionally, contacts are found with in-person interviews, but those  alone are too slow for COVID-19&#39;s ~48 hour window. That&#39;s why contact tracers need help, and be supported by \u2013  NOT replaced by \u2013 contact tracing apps.\n  (This idea didn&#39;t come from &#34;techies&#34;: using an app to fight COVID-19 was first proposed by  a team of Oxford epidemiologists.)\n  Wait, apps that trace who you&#39;ve been in contact with?... Does that mean giving up privacy, giving in to Big Brother?\n  Heck no!   DP-3T, a team of epidemiologists &amp; cryptographers (including one of us, Marcel Salath\u00e9) is  already making a contact tracing app \u2013 with code available to the public \u2013 that reveals  no info about your identity, location, who your contacts are, or even  how many contacts you&#39;ve had.\n        Along with similar teams like TCN Protocol  24 and MIT PACT  25, they&#39;ve inspired Apple &amp; Google to bake privacy-first contact tracing directly into Android/iOS.  26 (Don&#39;t trust Google/Apple? Good! The beauty of this system is it doesn&#39;t  needtrust!) Soon, your local public health  ...\n  But what about folks without smartphones? Or infections through doorknobs? Or &#34;true&#34; asymptomatic cases? Contact tracing apps can&#39;t catch all transmissions...  and that&#39;s okay! We don&#39;t need to catch  all transmissions, just 60%+ to get R &lt; 1.\n    Isolating  symptomatic cases would reduce R by up to 40%, and quarantining their  pre/a-symptomatic contacts would reduce R by up to 50%  28:\n    Thus, even without 100% contact quarantining, we can get R &lt; 1  without a lockdown! Much better for our mental &amp; financial health. (As for the cost to folks who have to self-isolate/quarantine,  governments should support them\u2013pay for the tests, job protection, subsidized paid  ...\n  We then keep R &lt; 1 until we have a vaccine, which turns susceptible  s into immune  s. Herd immunity, the  right way:\n    (Note: this calculator pretends the vaccines are 100% effective. Just remember that in reality, you&#39;d have to compensate by vaccinating  more than &#34;herd immunity&#34;, to  actually get herd immunity)\n              But what if things  still go wrong? Things have gone horribly wrong already. That&#39;s fear, and that&#39;s good! Fear gives us energy to create  backup plans.\n      What if R 0 is way higher than we thought, and the above interventions, even with mild distancing,  still aren&#39;t enough to get R &lt; 1?\n  Remember, even if we can&#39;t get R &lt; 1, reducing R still reduces the &#34;overshoot&#34; in total cases, thus saving lives. But still, R &lt; 1 is the ideal, so here&#39;s a few other ways to reduce R:\n      You&#39;re right. Masks don&#39;t stop you from getting sick  29... they stop you from getting  others sick.\n    To put a number on it: surgical masks  on the sick person reduce cold &amp; flu viruses in aerosols by 70%.  30 Reducing transmissions by 70% would be as large an impact as a lockdown!\n  However, we don&#39;t know for sure the impact of masks on COVID-19  specifically. In science, one should only publish a finding if you&#39;re 95% sure of it. (...should.  31) Masks, as of May 1st 2020, are less than &#34;95% sure&#34;.\n  However, pandemics are like poker.  Make bets only when you&#39;re 95% sure, and you&#39;ll lose everything at stake. As a recent article on masks in the British Medical Journal notes,  32 we  have to make cost/benefit analyses under uncertainty. Like so:\n  Cost: If homemade cloth masks (which are ~2/3 as effective as surgical masks  33), super cheap. If surgical masks, more expensive but still pretty cheap.\n  Benefit: Even if it&#39;s a 50 \u201350 chance of surgical masks reducing transmission by 0% or 70%, the average &#34;expected value&#34; is still 35%, same as a half-lockdown! So let&#39;s guess-timate that surgical masks reduce R by up to 35%, discounted  ...\n      Masks  alone won&#39;t get R &lt; 1. But if handwashing &amp; &#34;Test, Trace, Isolate&#34; only gets us to R = 1.10, having just 1/3 of people wear masks would tip that over to R &lt; 1, virus contained!\n    Okay, this isn&#39;t an &#34;intervention&#34; we can control, but it will help! Some news outlets report that summer won&#39;t do anything to COVID-19. They&#39;re half right: summer won&#39;t get R &lt; 1, but it  will reduce R.\n  For COVID-19, every extra 1\u00b0 Celsius (2.2\u00b0 Fahrenheit) makes R drop by 1.2%.  35 The summer-winter difference in New York City is 15\u00b0C (60\u00b0F), so summer will make R drop by 18%.\n    Summer alone won&#39;t make R &lt; 1, but if we have limited resources, we can scale back some interventions in the summer \u2013 so we can scale them  higher in the winter.\n    And if all that  still isn&#39;t enough to get R &lt; 1... we can do another lockdown.\n  But we wouldn&#39;t have to be 2-months-closed / 1-month-open over &amp; over! Because R is reduced, we&#39;d only need one or two more &#34;circuit breaker&#34; lockdowns before a vaccine is available. (Singapore had to do this recently,  ...\n    A moderate amount of hygiene &amp; &#34;Test, Trace, Isolate&#34;, with a mild amount of &#34;Masks For All&#34;, then...\n    Not to mention all the  other interventions we could do, to further push R down:\n        Even under a pessimistic scenario, it  is possible to beat COVID-19, while protecting our mental and financial health.Use the lockdown as a &#34;reset button&#34;, keep R &lt; 1 with case isolation + privacy-protecting contract  ...\n  Sure, you may have dried-out hands. But you&#39;ll get to invite a date out to a comics bookstore! You&#39;ll get to go out with friends to watch the latest Hollywood cash-grab. You&#39;ll get to people-watch at a library,  ...\n    So now, let&#39;s plan for some  worse worst-case scenarios. Water landing, get your life jacket, and please follow the lights to the emergency exits:\n    You get COVID-19, and recover. Or you get the COVID-19 vaccine. Either way, you&#39;re now immune...\n    COVID-19 is most closely related to SARS, which gave its survivors 2 years of immunity.  36\n    There&#39;s reports of folks recovering from COVID-19, then testing positive again, but it&#39;s unclear if these are false positives.  38\n  One  not-yet-peer-reviewed study on monkeys showed immunity to the COVID-19 coronavirus for at least 28 days.  39\n  But for COVID-19  in humans, as of May 1st 2020, &#34;how long&#34; is the big unknown.\n  For these simulations, let&#39;s say it&#39;s 1 year.\t Here&#39;s a simulation starting with 100%  , exponentially decaying into susceptible, no-immunity  s after 1 year, on  average, with variation:\n          Now, let&#39;s simulate a COVID-19 outbreak, over 10 years, with no interventions...  if immunity only lasts a year:\n    In previous simulations, we only had  one ICU-overwhelming spike. Now, we have several,  and   cases come to a rest  permanently at ICU capacity. (Which, remember, we  tripled for these simulations)\n          Counterintuitively, summer makes the spikes worse  and regular! This is because summer reduces new  s, but that in turn reduces new immune  s. Which means immunity plummets in the summer,  creating  ...\n  Thankfully, the solution to this is pretty straightforward \u2013 just vaccinate people every fall/winter, like we do with flu shots:\n  (After playing the recording, try simulating your own vaccination campaigns! Remember you can pause/continue the sim at any time)\n        To be clear: this is unlikely.Most epidemiologists expect a vaccine in 1 to 2 years. Sure, there&#39;s never been a vaccine for any of the other coronaviruses before, but that&#39;s  ...\n  Still, infectious disease researchers have expressed worries: What if we can&#39;t make enough?  40 What if we rush it, and it&#39;s not safe?  41\n  Even in the nightmare &#34;no-vaccine&#34; scenario, we still have 3 ways out. From most to least terrible:\n  1) Do intermittent or loose R &lt; 1 interventions, to reach &#34;natural herd immunity&#34;. (Warning: this will result in many deaths &amp; damaged lungs.  Andwon&#39;t work if  ...\n  2) Do the R &lt; 1 interventions forever. Contact tracing &amp; wearing masks just becomes a new norm in the post-COVID-19 world, like how STI tests &amp; wearing condoms became  ...\n  3) Do the R &lt; 1 interventions until we develop treatments that make COVID-19 way, way less likely to need critical care. (Which we should be doing  anyway!) Reducing ICU  ...\n  Here&#39;s a simulation of  no lasting immunity,  no vaccine, and not even any interventions \u2013 just slowly increasing capacity to survive the long-term spikes:\n        Maybe you&#39;d like to challenge our assumptions, and try different R 0&#39;s or numbers. Or try simulating your  own combination of intervention plans!\n  Here&#39;s an (optional) Sandbox Mode, with  everything available.

It&#39;s let us answer questions about the past few months, next few months, and next few years.\n        Teams of epidemiologists and policymakers ( left,  right, and  multi-partisan) have come to a consensus on how to beat COVID-19, while protecting our lives  and  ...\n        For everyone: Respect the lockdown so we can get out of Phase I asap.

"note_en": "Increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2) not only adds to change in earth\u2019s climate, but also poses a significant threat to our cognitive competences, according to a new study at University of Colorado, Boulder.\n Prior to the Industrial Revolution, global  average concentration of CO 2 was about 280 ppm, but the most recent measurement at NOAA\u2019s Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii in 2019 shows the atmospheric CO 2  levels have plateaued at 414 ppm. Also the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, if not mitigated, could put the outdoor CO 2\u00a0levels at 930 ppm with 100 ppm higher in the urban areas by 2100.\n  Breathing in an area where concentrations of CO 2  are high could cause the CO 2 levels in our blood to rise. This reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches the brain, which in turn  increases sleepiness, anxiety, and undermines cognitive function. If you have ever been to lecture hall or conference room jammed with people, you get the feeling.\n CO 2 concentrations are generally higher in indoors than outdoors. The reason being both the CO 2 that is otherwise in equilibrium with the outdoors, and the CO 2 that apartment inhabitants generate as they exhale. Also the level of outdoor CO 2 in metropolis is much higher compared to cleaner locations like the countryside or rural areas.\n \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how high CO 2\u00a0levels get in enclosed spaces,\u201d  explained Kris Karnauskas, associate professor and lead author of the study. \u201cIt affects everybody \u2014 from little kids packed into classrooms to scientists, business people and decision makers to regular folks in their houses and apartments.\u201d\n  \u201cBuilding ventilation typically modulates CO 2\u00a0levels in buildings, but there are situations when there are too many people and not enough fresh air to dilute the CO 2\u201d  said co-author Shelly Mille. \u201cCO 2\u00a0can also build up in poorly ventilated spaces over longer periods of time, such as overnight while sleeping in bedrooms.\u201d\n For the study, Karnauskas and his team formulated a holistic approach that assesses predicted future outdoor concentrations of carbon dioxide and the impact of localized urban emissions, a model which studies the relationship between indoor and outdoor CO 2\u00a0concentration and how it impacts human cognitive faculties. They found that if the outdoor concentrations of the gas reach 990 ppm, it would push the indoor concentration at 1400, the effect of which can be detrimental.\n Evidence of people exhibiting substantial deficits in cognitive function after a sustained exposure to this level of CO2 has been demonstrated in some studies. Although the studies yield some conflicting results, most researchers seem to agree that elevated CO 2concentrations can cause disruption in high level cognitive domains like decision-making and planning. In fact, at 1400, our ability to make decision plummet by 25 percent and strategic thinking by 50 percent, the researchers found.  ...\n The effect that elevated CO 2 has on the cognitive function is much like what triggers  ocean acidification. Both are a \u201cdirect\u201d effect of the gas\u2019 concentration, and it\u2019s the elevated CO 2 that induces harm not the warming it causes.\n Cutting emissions is the most effective means to stop CO 2 from reaching harmful concentrations, but this would require globally adopted mitigation strategies like the ones put forth by the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the researchers say.\n \u201cThis is a complex problem, and our study is at the beginning. It\u2019s not just a matter of predicting global (outdoor) CO 2 levels,\u201d Karnauskas explained. \u201cIt\u2019s going from the global background emissions, to concentrations in the urban environment, to the indoor concentrations, and finally the resulting human impact. We need even broader, interdisciplinary teams of researchers to explore this: investigating each step in our own silos will not be enough.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:55:13", "tags":

This means if a person has an Insurance Policy for his health condition, he can face his health problems with the secure mind. People can set their minds stress free and look focus on other daily activities when they having Health  ...\n Insurance is not only for human lives and health. It is relatable for physical assets also. If a person has an automobile, there is a risk of road accidents and also damages for the vehicle. So he can get a Car Insurance Policy for the automobile and get a free mind. Because if he faces an accident or damage for the vehicle or third party, he can cover it with Insurance Coverage.\n  Insurance Company is the organization that collects everyone\u2019s funds as monthly premiums. And give the funds who need it at the times. Insurance Companies are not non-profitable organizations. But they are doing good social work. People know the risks of their lives. But they do not consider it to save their money. With Insurance Companies, people can save their money for their risks and get funds with interests when it comes to real risk.\n    Life Insurance is the Primary and most important Insurance Policy. Every person who is in up to 18 years old can start this policy. Here the main purpose is covering life. This is not for the person who has the policy this is for their family members. If a person dies due to any reason their family becomes helpless. If the person is the main income source of the family, this will be a more critical situation. The family has to manage funeral expenses and the rest expenses such as day to day  ...\n  Car Insurance is special for automobiles. As the law, every car owner has to have a Car Insurance policy. Some countries require this at least as Third Party Insurance. The third-party is anyone who hurts or damaged property by the respective automobile.  With this coverage, the car owner can manage the accident by covering the cost. Here different car owners have to pay different premiums due to o reasons which are considered by their Insurance Company. This premium is the basic answer for  ...\n  Health Insurance is also an Insurance Policy that covers people \u2019s life. But here mainly focus on the health condition and health problems of humans. Having Health Insurance coverage is a primary need in some countries. But middle-level countries still don \u2019t consider this as a law. Having a Health Insurance is like having a bank saving. People can cover their hospital bills by this policy. And most importantly, people can have their daily revenue when they got sicked. And also if a person  ...\n  Health Insurance Company is an Insurance Company that is taking the risk of the health-conscious of people. They are specialized in the Health category since other Insurance Companies covering all the risk opportunities of lives including assets too.\n Here people can take care of their health problems such as critical illnesses and hospital coverage with the Company. If they got sick or hospitalized, then the Health Insurance Company will take care of the doctor charges, hospital bills, and also the daily revenue of the person. All for these, customers have to pay a constant premium for the Insurance Company. Most of the time the premium is very affordable and little amount when comparing them getting coverage as health insurance benefits.  ...\n  The primary income-generating method for an  Insurance Company is the premium income and they have to cover all the expenses of operations of the organization. As an example, if an Insurance Company earned 5$ million as the collection of premiums. Then if they paid 4$ million as the claims, the rest of 1$ million is the revenue for the company.\n   The income generated from the premiums is not enough to maintain a company. They are investing to boost their financial strength in low-risk financial investment methods like the stock market, e-currencies. With this method, Insurance Companies can easily generate a higher income.\n  All the customers who are starting an insurance policy don\u2019t continue for the agreed period. If they got failed when paying the premiums, then the policy will automatically lapse due to the agreement. Then the paid premiums are cannot be taken by the customer. And the premiums can be taken for the company and they can reinvest them to make more money.\n  In some times, customers stop their insurance policies after a certain time. As the Insurance Agreement, there is a significant time in which customers can cancel the insurance policy and take the money back. Here, customers don \u2019t allow to take all the premiums and they only can get the interests for the period and other balance will keep by the Insurance Company. And again as the previous, they invest the money in low risk investing methods and create more money within the existing  ...\n As every profit-oriented organization, \u00a0Insurance Companies cannot survive in the industry without making money instead of premiums. Because premiums are not enough to continue the company healthily. Insurance Companies are the solution for peoples struggling moments when they got sick with critical conditions because they cannot pay the hospital bills at the same time they have sick. So Insurance Companies are doing a good job for human beings.

This column examines the persistence of corruption among a sample of privately held firms from 12 Central and Eastern European countries. Creating a proxy for corporate corruption based on a firm \u2019s internal inefficiency, it is suggested that corruption can enhance a firm \u2019s overall profitability. A channel analysis reveals that inflating staff costs is the most common approach by which firms divert funds to  ...\n      Corporate corruption exerts a number of adverse influences on a nation\u2019s economy (Mauro 1995).\u00a0The presence of corruption encourages the growth of unofficial economies and affects the ability of a nation to efficiently allocate resources or sustain economic growth (Tanzi 1983, Slemrod 2007). Corruption also impedes the development of market-supporting institutions such as independent legal or regulatory systems (de Soto 1989, Shleifer and Vishny 1993).\n In spite of these adverse effects, corruption persists. It remains a global phenomenon despite increased corporate transparency, expanded international capital flows, and enhanced institutional monitoring. We contend that corruption persists because of the economic and financial advantages it provides to firms. We also contend that corporate corruption continues to exist because it provides benefits to a firm. The access to regulators, bureaucratic waivers, and accelerated/more favourable  ...\n  To examine the persistence of corruption within a firm, we must measure it at firm-level. Our approach uses the concept of firm inefficiency, derived from a production function. Since a production function describe optimal output relative to inputs, any deviation from these levels can be seen as inefficient. After netting out common industry- and economy-wide factors, a residual inefficiency remains (Ferris at al. 2020).\n We then introduce the concept of an \u2018honest firm \u2019. An honest firm is one that is headquartered in a country with a low level of corruption. Foreign firms headquartered in countries with low levels of corruption should have a lower propensity to engage in illegal activities, even when operating abroad. This is because such firms tend to adhere to their home cultural and legal practices, regardless of their immediate operating environment (Stopford and Strange 1991, Fisman and Miguel 2007).  ...\n It is important to note that we use the term corporate corruption to include a broad range of illegal activities undertaken by firms. These consist of bribery, extortion, kickbacks, sweetheart contracts, tunneling, tax evasion, accounting fraud, and a variety of other activities that are prosecutable. These activities are reflected in a firm \u2019s internal inefficiency because they increase labour and operating costs. These expenses are often unassociated with any economic purpose and can  ...\n  The study examines 12 countries from Central and Eastern Europe from 2001 to 2015. We draw our data from the Amadeus database, which is maintained by Bureau van Dijk (BvD) and contains comprehensive financial and ownership information for private European firms. Our sample consists of 188,994 firm-year observations, spanning 15 years. To determine the extent to which corruption persists across our sample economies, we report the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), constructed by Transparency  ...\n Figure 1 Geographical distribution of country corruption by mean of the reversed CPI (100-CPI, i.e. a higher value means greater corruption)\n    In our analysis of corporate profitability, we find that corruption has a positive influence. This result holds whether we examine a firm\u2019s return to total invested capital (ROA), or to the return on equity (ROE). These results are consistent with the Corporate Advantage Hypothesis. That is, corruption persists because of its ability to improve overall corporate profitability.\n It might be the case that the various changes in financial reporting, and the expanded oversight of the financial system following the crisis of 2007, have made corruption less possible (or capable of generating profitability improvements) for the firm. We find that the 2007 Global Crisis did not have a meaningful effect on the relation between corruption and corporate profitability. This relation remains persistent and appears invariant to regulatory or disclosure changes mandated  ...\n To gain further insight into how corruption affects corporate profitability, we decompose the ROA and ROE measures into a firm\u2019s turnover, margin, and multiplier components. We conclude that corruption enhances investor returns as suggested by the Corporate Advantage Hypothesis. It appears to accomplish this by improving margins and turnover. These improvements occur through increased sales, or perhaps by reduced expenses. Corruption allows a firm to achieve both.\n Given that corruption is persistent (and is associated with increased profitability), we now examine precisely how this occurs. That is, we investigate exactly what channels firms use to divert capital to fund their corrupt practices. We identify four such possible channels. These candidate channels are partially selected on the basis of Moeller \u2019s (2009) observation that poor screening procedures for new employees, frequent related party transactions, close relations to suppliers,  ...\n In Figure 3 we summarise the findings for our channel analysis. We report the number of sample countries in which channel expenditures are positively associated with corporate corruption. We observe that staff costs are positively associated with corruption in eight of our sample countries. This is often due to the use of phantom employees to fraudulently transfer wealth from firms. Overstatement of material costs is yet another way that managers can steal money from their corporate  ...\n Figure 3 The number of sample countries in which channel expenditures are positively associated with corporate corruption\n   We find that corruption influences the returns enjoyed by a firm \u2019s investors. To understand how corruption improves profitability, we decompose our return measures into their margin, turnover, and multiplier components. Corruption works its effect on profitability through the improvement of both margins and turnover. We also find that corruption persists even after the extensive regulatory reforms following the Global Crisis of 2007. The additional disclosure requirements, and  ...\n These findings have important implications for policy development and future research. Our examination of the channels through which corruption occurs identifies a target for regulators, lawmakers, and other parties who have an interest in eliminating corruption from the greater political economy. Our analysis of corporate sales, margin, and profitability could be useful for the design and implementation of public policy aimed at economic growth and efficiency.

and generates the free category on it using  idris-ct. It then uses the initial state and path provided in the execution (call them  x and  [x1, ... , xn], respectively) to evaluate the composition  idx;x1;...;xn. It returns success or error depending if this defines a valid morphism in the free category or not.\n     This will install the binary in elba&#39;s binary folder. Typically  ~/.elba/bin if this folder is in your path you can simply call  fsm-oracle to test it out.\n You can find elba and instructions on how to install it on the  official repository.\n  Just put your input (as specified below) in a file, for example  input.JSON, and run:\n  If the execution is valid, Idris will return a json output of the following form:\n       Input has to be fed as JSON, and is converted to Idris terms and types through the use of  Typedefs. The Idris types for FSM executions are defined in the file  Tgraph.idr.\n The internal input format is a term of type  FSMExec, and is of the form (FSMSpec, FSMState, FSMPath). It consists of three things: A specification of the FSM on which executions are run ( FSMSpec), an initial state ( FSMState), and a list of actions to evaluate ( FSMPath).\n  The type of  FSMSpec is  (Nat,List (Nat Nat)): The FSM is specified as a pair, where the first component denotes the number of states (vertexes) of the FSM, while the second is a list of pairs of vertexes (edgelist) denoting the possible actions.\n For instance,  (5,[(2,1),(4,2),(0, 3)]) specifies a FSM having  5 vertexes, enumerated  0,1,2,3,4, and three possible actions: One going from  2 to  1, one going from  4 to  2 and one going from  0 to  3.\n The edgelist has to be in range as specified by the number of vertexes. As such, specifications such as  (5,[(7,1),(4,2),(0, 3)])or  (5,[(5,5)]) are considered invalid and will produce an error.\n  The type of  FSMState is  Nat. This specifies an initial vertex from which the computation has to start.\n The initial state has to be in range as specified by the number of vertexes in  FSMSpec. So, for instance,  4 is a valid state for the FSM  (5,[(2,1),(4,2),(0, 3)]), while  5 is not, and will produce an error.\n   Each number in the list has to be in range as specified by the length of the edgelist in  FSMSpec. As such,  [1,0] is a valid path for the FSM  (5,[(2,1),(4,2),(0, 3)]) (indicating to first use the action going from  4 to  2 and then the one going from  2 to  1), while  [3] is not.\n         Terms of type  FSMSpec as described above have to be fed as inputs, encoded in JSON format. The way JSON encoding is implemented can be found in the file  JSONFormat.idr.\n   To encode tuples, and the usual square bracket notation for lists. Pairs defining edges are encoded as:\n   Applying these definitions recursively, any term of type  FSMExec can be encoded. For example, the following is the JSON encoding of the input execution  ((5, [(1,1),(3,4),(2,1)]) , 2, [2,0,0]):\n {   &#34;_0 &#34; : {   &#34;_0 &#34; :  5,   &#34;_1 &#34; : [ {   &#34;input &#34; :  1,   &#34;output &#34; :  1 }, {   &#34;input &#34; :  3,   &#34;output &#34; :  4 }, {   &#34;input &#34; :  2,   &#34;output &#34; :  1 }] },   &#34;_1 &#34; :  2,   &#34;_2 &#34; : [ 2,  0,  0]}\n  Unless explicitly stated otherwise all files in this repository are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:54:57", "tags": "oracle,mac,fsm", "title": "FSM-ORACLE-\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u9884\u8a00", "title_en": "FSM-Oracle \u2013 A formally verified Finite State Machine oracle", "transed": 0, "url": "https://github.com/statebox/fsm-oracle", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["oracle", "mac", "fsm"]}]
