"note_en": "As volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occasionally remind us, the earth beneath our feet is constantly on the move.\n Continental plates only move around 1-4 inches per year, so we don\u2019t notice the tectonic forces that are continually reshaping the surface of our planet. But on a long enough timeline, those inches add up to big changes in the way landmasses on Earth are configured.\n Today\u2019s map, by  Massimo Pietrobon, is a look back to when all land on the planet was arranged into a supercontinent called Pangea. Pietrobon\u2019s map is unique in that it overlays the approximate borders of present day countries to help us understand how Pangea broke apart to form the world that we know today.\n   Pangea began developing over 300 million years ago, eventually making up one-third of the earth\u2019s surface. The remainder of the planet was an enormous ocean known as Panthalassa.\n As time goes by, scientists are beginning to piece together more information on the climate and patterns of life on the supercontinent. Similar to parts of Central Asia today, the center of the landmass is thought to have been arid and inhospitable, with temperatures reaching 113\u00baF (45\u00baC). The extreme temperatures revealed by  climate simulationsare supported by the fact that very few fossils are found in the modern day regions that once existed in the middle of Pangea. The strong contrast between  ...\n By this unique point in history, plants and animals had spread across the landmass, and animals (such as dinosaurs) were able to wander freely across the entire expanse of Pangea.\n  Around 200 million years ago, magma began to swell up through a weakness in the earth\u2019s crust, creating the volcanic rift zone that would eventually cleave the supercontinent into pieces. Over time, this rift zone would become the Atlantic Ocean. The most visible evidence of this split is in the similar shape of the coastlines of modern-day Brazil and West Africa.\n Present-day North America broke away from Europe and Africa, and as the map highlights, Atlantic Canada was once connected to Spain and Morocco.\n The concept of plate tectonics is behind some of modern Earth\u2019s most striking features. The Himalayas, for example, were formed after the Indian subcontinent broke off the eastern side of Africa and crashed directly into Asia. Many of the  world\u2019s tallest mountains were formed by this process of plate convergence \u2013 a process that, as far as we know, is unique to Earth.\n  Since the average continent is only moving about 1 foot (0.3m) every decade, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll ever be alive to see an epic geographical revision to the world map.\n However, for whatever life exists on Earth roughly 300 million years in the future, they may have front row seats in seeing the emergence of a new supercontinent: Pangea Proxima.\n  As the above  video from the Paleomap Project shows, Pangea Proxima is just one possible supercontinent configuration that occurs in which Australia slams into Indonesia, and North and South America crash into Africa and Antarctica, respectively.\n Interestingly, Pangea Proxima could have a massive inland sea, mainly made up of what is the Indian Ocean today. Meanwhile, the other oceans would combine into one superocean that would take up the majority of the Earth\u2019s surface.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 00:25:14", "tags":

worth north of $4 billion dollars, included positions in United, American, Southwest and Delta Airlines.\n &#34;The world has changed for the airlines. And I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way,&#34; he said.\n Buffett said he admires the airlines, but that sometimes there are events like the coronavirus &#34;on the lower levels of probabilities&#34; that necessitate a quick change.\n He added: &#34;When we sell something, very often it&#39;s going to be our entire stake: We don&#39;t trim positions.&#34;\n Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and billionaire value investor  Warren Buffett said that the conglomerate has sold the entirety of its equity position in the U.S. airline industry. The prior stake, worth north of $4 billion dollars in December, included  positions in United,  American,  Southwest and  Delta Airlines.\n  &#34;The world has changed for the airlines. And I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way,&#34; he said during Berkshire&#39;s annual shareholder meeting Saturday, which was virtual this year. &#34;I don&#39;t know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits because of the extended period.&#34;\n But &#34;I think there are certain industries, and unfortunately, I think that the airline industry, among others, that are really hurt by a forced shutdown by events that are far beyond our control,&#34; he added.\n Demand for air travel has plunged since March as the virus and precautions like shelter-in-place orders keep potential passengers home.\u00a0Asked by CNBC&#39;s  Becky Quick to clarify if Berkshire had sold  all of its airline holdings, Buffett answered &#34;yes.&#34;\n He explained: &#34;When we sell something, very often it&#39;s going to be our entire stake: We don&#39;t trim positions. That&#39;s just not the way we approach it any more than if we buy 100% of a business. We&#39;re going to sell it down to 90% or 80%.&#34;\n &#34;If we like a business, we&#39;re going to buy as much of it as we can and keep it as long as we can,&#34; he added. &#34;And when we change our mind we don&#39;t take half measures.&#34;\n  Buffett reiterated that he admires the airlines and their management teams, but that sometimes there are events  like the coronavirus calamity &#34;on the lower levels of probabilities that happen&#34; that necessitate a quick change to an investment.\n As of December, Berkshire owned 42.5 million (10% stake) American shares, 58.9 million (9.2% stake) Delta shares, 51.3 million (10.1% stake) Southwest shares and 21.9 million (7.6% stake) United shares. The stocks are down 62.9%, 58.7%, 45.8% and 69.7%, respectively, in 2020.\n  His comments Saturday afternoon from Omaha came after  Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter earnings that showed Buffett and his lieutenants built up the conglomerate&#39;s cash stockpile and only nibbled at equities during the violent stock market rout in March.\n In 2016, Berkshire revealed a surprise bet on the sector that Buffett had before shunned. But years of consolidation through post-bankruptcy mega-mergers and a decline in fuel prices have helped airlines rake in record profits.\n Airlines posted their 10th straight year of profits in 2019 and were preparing for even more growth in travel demand early this year, just when coronavirus started to spread.\u00a0The four airlines Berkshire sold out of are scrambling to save cash, slashing routes, parking hundreds of planes and urging employees to take unpaid and partial leave.\n The so-called &#34;Oracle of Omaha&#34; had alluded to the airline sale earlier in Saturday&#39;s meeting, when he said he&#39;d made\u00a0an &#34;understandable mistake&#34; when valuing the airline stocks as a near-global halt in travel due to the coronavirus sent their prices sharply lower.\n &#34;When we bought [airlines], we were getting an attractive amount for our money when investing across the airlines,&#34; he said. &#34;It turned out I was wrong about that business because of something that was not in any way the fault of four excellent CEOs. Believe me. No joy of being a CEO of an airline.&#34;\n &#34;I don&#39;t know that three, four years from now people will fly as many passenger miles as they did last year,&#34; he said. &#34;You&#39;ve got too many planes.&#34;\n Airline executives have called the pandemic the industry&#39;s worst-ever crisis and expect the impact to take several years to recover from. Last month, American, United, Southwest and Delta reported their first losses in years. U.S. travel demand is down 95% on the year.\n Prior to 2016, Buffett had eschewed airline investments and had been so opposed to putting money into the industry in the past that he told shareholders in a 2007 note that &#34;if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.&#34;\n U.S. airlines last month started receiving portions of $25 billion in federal grants and loans that require them not to lay off or cut pay rates of workers through Sept. 30. Major airline executives this week warned they will have to shrink to manage through the crisis.\n Subscribe   to CNBC PRO  for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from

"note_en": "Itch.io hosts web games / apps by embedding them within an iframe. While this doesn&#39;t affect Strike&#39;s functionality for the most part, I&#39;m not sure if all browsers / devices support file loading and saving from within the iframe. The standalone version is provided in case there are some features that the iframe can&#39;t support.\n      16-&#39;color&#39; palette via dither patterns. Each pattern is treated as a separate color for fill tool\n     save images as a 16-color greyscale (which will import back into Strike with all patterns intact), or as 1-bit black and white image\n  Strike is supported on mobile devices and tablets; I personally use it with an iPad Pro.\n    Strike is not meant to be a full-featured paint app, so has quite a few limitations.\n  Undo / redo may slow down for large strokes or complex drawings. If they behave strangely, please file a bug report.\n There is a limited autosave feature; by default, starting up Strike will load up the previously drawn image. Creating a new canvas will erase the autosave. You can disable autosaves via the settings (gear) menu. Strike only autosaves one image at a time, so please regularly export your work.\n    Strike has been tested on up-to-date Firefox, Chrome, Microsoft Edge (the Chromium-based one), and Safari (both desktop and iOS). Do note that with Safari, the app may behave weirdly on versions pre-13.0 (as I\u00a0was not able to test on anything earlier).\n    The program is written in JS without any build tools. Source code can be found at\u00a0 https://github.com/dmliao/strike.\n   Just for your info, there is a small bug with the brush\u00a0when you increase its size and then decrease again.\n Nice work! One tiny, tiny suggestion: for the very first use of the tool, it might be worth defaulting the brush size to something larger than 1, because a 1-pixel-sized brush doesn&#39;t really show off the patterns much. A small thing, but might make it fractionally easier to grasp.\n Really nice controls! It would be cool to have an opacity option too (e.g. all black on all white at 50% opacity would result in the middle dot pattern)\n love love love this! any plans for key mapping some of the controls? esp. the brush size and stuff? really nice!", "posttime": "2020-05-04 00:03:04", "tags": "\u7ed8\u753b,web,strike", "title":

"note_en": "In December 2017,  two  videos emerged that showed Navy pilots encountering mysterious spherical objects that appeared, at first glance, to move through the air in ways that baffled experts. A third, released in March 2018, depicted a similar encounter.\n Everyone who watched \u2014 including the pilots who filmed them \u2014 had the same question: What, exactly, are these things?\n Last week, a Navy official publicly called these mysterious objects \u201cUnidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP),\u201d giving name to the inscrutable little dots and reigniting scrutiny around the unidentified flying objects (a term the Navy does not want to use even though the objects that are flying cannot be identified.)\n   \u201cThe Navy designates the objects contained in these videos as unidentified aerial phenomena,\u201d Joseph Gradisher, spokesman for the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare,  told the Black Vault blog, a  massive civilian repository of government documents mostly obtained by Freedom of Information Act requests.\n  Gradisher further explained that \u201cThe \u2018Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\u2019 terminology is used because it provides the basic descriptor for the sightings/observations of unauthorized/unidentified aircraft/objects that have been observed entering/operating in the airspace of various military-controlled training ranges.\u201d\n Black Vault\u2019s founder, John Greenewald Jr., told The Washington Post that he believed the remarks were significant because, for the first time, the Navy acknowledged the existence of the objects in the videos on the record and admitted that the department cannot identify them. Greenewald also reported that the videos were not originally intended for public release.\n  Because of this revelation, Gradisher\u2019s comments to Black Vault have ricocheted across the Internet this week, getting picked up everywhere from Popular Mechanics (\u201c The Navy Says Those UFO Videos Are Real\u201d) to the front page of the Drudge Report (\u201c UPDATE: Navy says It\u2019s Tracking UFOs \u2026\u201d).\n  \u201cThe most powerful military doesn\u2019t know what these objects are,\u201d Greenewald said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean aliens, or that they don\u2019t have some plausible logical explanation. But \u2026 admitting that they see things in the sky and they can\u2019t identify them, that to me is the most amazing part of this.\u201d\n  In a subsequent interview with The Post, Gradisher downplayed the significance of the moniker, saying that \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d was not a new term and that the Navy preferred it to the more popular \u201cUFO\u201d because the latter comes with cultural stigma that might discourage pilots from reporting such incidents for fear of being labeled, well, kooky.\n  This year,  the Navy overhauled its guidelines for reporting these UAPs to encourage pilots to flag disturbances, which have been occurring regularly since 2014. Gradisher said one possible explanation could be the rise of unmanned aerial systems (or UAS, if you can handle another abbreviation) such as quadrocopters, a kind of drone easily available to the public.\n  \u201cAll of this is about incursions into our training ranges by what we\u2019re calling UAPs,\u201d he said. \u201cThese incursions cause a hazard to the safety of our aviators and the security of our operators, and that\u2019s what the Navy\u2019s investigating, these range incursions.\u201d\n \u201cThese three videos that are out there \u2026 reflect three reports of incursions into our training ranges\u201d that occurred in 2004 and 2015, he said.\n   The three videos, titled \u201c FLIR1,\u201d \u201c Gimbal\u201d and \u201c GoFast,\u201d were initially released by the  New York Times and an organization called To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science, which \u201cengages with global citizens to investigate the outer edges of science and unconventional thinking\u201d and was  founded by a former member of Blink 182.\n That the eerie footage had emerged along with revelations about  a secret and since-shelved Pentagon division known as the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program did not exactly staunch speculation that a less-earthly culprit was to blame for these \u201cincursions.\u201d On YouTube, the footage has been watched millions of times.\n  Black Vault\u2019s founder, Greenewald, would not speculate whether Gradisher\u2019s comments were further proof of extraterrestrial life, saying he prefers to stick to what the documents he\u2019s obtained via FOIA requests tell him. But the subject of UAPs, or UFOs, or whatever we\u2019re calling them, continues to fascinate him.\n  The truth is still out there, and for Greenewald, there was only one way to find it: \u201cWe just have to keep asking those questions.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-03 23:17:55", "tags": "\u6d77\u519b,admits,navy", "title":

"note_en": "I\u2019ve sat back and witnessed the development of Windows 10 and appreciated the speed of new feature releases, but it seems there\u2019s a price to pay for this new \u201cWindows as a service\u201d world. Microsoft has gradually been infesting Windows 10 with annoying ads. The first emerged on the lock screen as \u201ctips,\u201d and then there was the  bundling of  Candy Crush with the OS, and now Microsoft has started blasting notifications into the task bar and File Explorer.\n Windows 10 users have been complaining vocally in recent weeks about  OneDrive notifications in the File Explorer, encouraging them to pay $6.99 for an Office 365 subscription. The task bar notifications that prompt people to switch to Edge when they use Chrome, or install Microsoft\u2019s Personal Shopping Assistant for Chrome, have been appearing for months. Microsoft even decided to use notifications to  warn Chrome usersabout battery drain. These types of notifications not only spoil the experience  ...\n These Edge notifications are all over the place now. Never seen this one before  pic.twitter.com/4gsoxEYgHk\n\u2014 Tom Warren (@tomwarren)  October 31, 2016\n  Now Microsoft is planning to preload another app in Windows 10: Sling TV. While only US Windows 10 users  will get Sling TV preloaded without the necessary subscription, it will sit alongside  Candy Crushand Solitaire as other examples of what will soon be described as bloatware. Thankfully, it \u2019s easy to uninstall these unnecessary apps, but that doesn \u2019t mean Microsoft won \u2019t add more to the mix in the future. Microsoft used to blame its OEM partners for bundling lots of useless apps on Windows  ...\n   Some might argue that Microsoft is well within its rights as most people got Windows 10 free of charge. That\u2019s a valid argument for some, but most Windows users will have paid for a license for the OS through the purchase of a laptop or desktop PC. Placing notifications in the File Explorer and task bar \u2014 parts of the operating system that no other developers are allowed to touch \u2014 just feels really unnecessary and an abuse of power.\n Microsoft added a notification center to Windows 10 for a reason. If it feels the need to blast its loyal users with irritating prompts then these should be channeled into that notification center, not wedged into the File Explorer or on top of the task bar. You shouldn&#39;t have to dig deep into a  settings panel to disable these; they shouldn&#39;t be there in your File Explorer in the first place.

(That\u2019s 7 hours, if you\u2019re counting.)\n   She recalls the tiniest details ( remember the\u00a0time\u00a0you wanted to start an events company?) about my life.\n And even when things are awry at her start-up, she\u2019s\u00a0 lucid in her stress.\n I once Ingrid how she defined success. And without a hint of hesitation she said:\n     If\u00a0time\u00a0is the currency of achievement, why are some able to cash in their allocation for more chips than others?\n And in a world of rapid fire Slack messages, daily episodes of\u00a0 The Daily\u00a0and Zoom calls up the wazoo \u2013 who on earth has the right to \u00a0not feel rushed?\n Wait But Why\u2019s\u00a0Tim Urban offers a clue. As one of my blogging idols, Urban has the deft ability to crank out 10,000 word posts (like\u00a0 this one\u00a0on career change) that double as\u00a0free\u00a0life coaching sessions.\n   Digging into the mentions, it becomes quite clear why he\u00a0 just doesn\u2019t use Google Drive.\n  In the book\u00a0 No BS\u00a0Time\u00a0Management,\u00a0Dan Kennedy has an entire chapter dedicated to the evil forces that\u00a0 make us feel rushed all the dang\u00a0time.\u00a0Look no further than the name of chapter two itself:\n How to Drive a Stake Through the Hearts of the\u00a0Time\u00a0Vampires Out to Suck You Dry\n    There\u2019s one thing you\u2019ll never see in a casino.\u00a0 A clock.\u00a0And that\u2019s good business \u2013 if you\u2019re the dealer.\n   You actually do this already \u2013 the Peloton Leaderboard, a Headspace streak or the star chart that rewards your 6 year old\u2019s good behavior.\n   It\u2019s the\u00a0 Timular\u00a0Time\u00a0Tracker\u00a0and it lets you easily account for your\u00a0time\u00a0so that your days don\u2019t disappear like the clock-less casino.\n  When I first hired my business coach, he asked me for an audit of my\u00a0time.\n      In the $10 category there was the constant re-scheduling Zoom calls, formatting Keynotes, responding to YouTube comments, and gathering my 1099s.\n    But whether you\u2019re a business owner, executive or manager \u2013 there absolutely are daily actions that could have $10,000 outcomes in the future.\n   When you break the code of extremely successful people like Ingrid, you realize that they have an\u00a0 unwavering commitment\u00a0to $10,000/hr work.\n And it\u2019s not necessarily profit-driven \u2013 they\u2019re simply\u00a0 deliberate in playing the long game.\n   \u201cI arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.\u201d\n This succinctly captures the our daily tension as well-intentioned day spiral out of our control\u2026 minutes after our alarms go off.\n   Be perfectly present with your child or do a task that fattens their 529 plan?\n Should you give the hamster wheel another good twirl or pursue more purposeful work that energizes you?\n In the NYT article\u00a0 productivity isn\u2019t about\u00a0time\u00a0management, it\u2019s about attention management\u00a0Wharton Professor (and longtime RadReader) Adam Grant sheds some light into Ingrid\u2019s unique mindset:\n I\u2019ve found that productive people don\u2019t agonize about which desire to pursue. They go after both simultaneously, gravitating toward projects that are personally interesting and socially meaningful.\n Which brings me to a peculiar recent discovery of mine. This discovery touches three of my favorite activities: surfing, writing and meditation.\n      You may know it as Flow. Or the Zone. Rowers refer to it as\u00a0 swing:\n The swing carries us; We do not force it. We pump our legs to drive our arc higher, but gravity does most of the work. We are not so much swinging as being swung. The boat swings you. The shell wants to move fast: Speed sings in its lines and nature. Our job is simply to work with the shell, to stop holding it back with our thrashing struggles to go faster. Trying too hard sabotages boat speed.\n Ingrid\u2019s days are\u00a0 rich with swing.\u00a0She\u2019s found her\u00a0 Wu Wei\u00a0\u2013 and I\u2019m on the hunt for mine.\n Let\u2019s design a life system to find that Wu Wei \u2013 sign up for  Supercharge Your Productivity with Notion.

Siddhartha was the founding member of IIFL Wealth. Siddhartha has also worked with HSBC, Citibank &amp; UTI bank in wealth\u00a0management &amp; merchant banking roles. He writes about finance &amp; life and has authored a book \u2013 8 Minute Decision.\n    Covid-19 will change the way the world works; just like the Great Depression, dot-com bubble, and the 2008 financial crash did in the past. The question on everyone\u2019s mind is, \u2018Will things go back to normal?\u2019\n  I\u2019ve been pondering, like many have, what fundamental changes will take place in how people, businesses, and economies function. The next 12 months will be difficult. Many businesses will struggle, some may even die. But as with economic adversities of the past, new industries will emerge bringing with it renewed hope of recovery. Eventually, things will go back to normal. Just that we\u2019ll have to change the definition of normal.  Welcome to the  New Normal.\n    This  infographic on the history of pandemics is insightful and hence I won\u2019t touch upon it.\n  While Covid-19 may not have the scale of pandemics of the past (as of date), the economic damage has and will continue to affect more people than the disease itself.\n    Studying past trends of similar infections can help in drawing inferences as to what might help us going forward. What would it take to see this pandemic through?\n    There\u2019s a high likelihood we\u2019re 12 months away from a semblance of normalcy. The biggest worry is a mutating virus that brings wave upon wave of attacks, each deadlier than the other. During the course of time that Covid-19 lasts, businesses and the global economy will continue to be significantly impacted.\n    It might be a mouthful but here \u2019s a look at what \u2019s to come in the immediate future. Liquidity is expected to remain tight as the cost of borrowing in real terms will jump upwards. This is despite central banks \u2019efforts to reduce interest rates. Banks and financial institutions will be under immense pressure as the fear of NPAs, insolvency and bankruptcies increase multifold. The government will focus on meeting hyper demand for essential goods while non-essential businesses  ...\n    I don\u2019t want to sound like a pessimist \u2013 the road forward looks rough. While there are sectors and businesses that will benefit, the prognosis is rather grim. In my best guess, here are some of the sectors that will be adversely affected and others that will see an uptick.\n    Apparel &amp; Textile will get hit adversely due to disruption in labour supply, raw material unavailability, working capital constraints and restricted demand due to limited movement of people and purchasing ability.\n  Auto sector (which includes automobiles and auto parts) will continue to face challenges on account of lack of demand, global recession and falling income levels.\n  Aviation &amp; Tourism is one sector which has the highest probability of going under without direct government intervention. In the next 12 months, it\u2019s highly unlikely people will travel for leisure apart from very essential travel.\n  Shipping and Non-Food Retail \u2013 Non food retail chains and global shipping businesses will find this 12 month period very challenging.\n  Building &amp; Construction businesses are generally leveraged and hence will face the dual challenges of high-interest payments and lack of sales.\n      Broadly, anything which involves personal interaction will face problems in the next 12 months \u2013 real estate or big-ticket items/luxury products.\n    Digital &amp; Internet Economy: Online based products &amp; services companies will find new takers\r There will be a sudden spike in the demand for Content, with digital content being in demand more than ever.\n  FMCG &amp; Retail will benefit immensely. With continued fear, food-based retail chains, and companies catering to low-ticket consumption demand will emerge as winners.\n  Speciality Chemicals: Firms dealing in Chemicals will see a jump due to increased demand for disinfectants, drugs and medicines.\n    The smallcases in the chart are  Specialty Chemicals,  Pharma Tracker and  FMCG Tracker.  A  smallcase is a basket of stocks/ETFs based on ideas, themes and strategies. They are professionally managed and offer investors more transparency and control over their investments.\n    Predictions. Anyone can do it, everyone does. It doesn\u2019t cost anything and does no harm. Not in my line of work.\n  As an investment professional, I\u2019m responsible for the management of over $250+ million in client money. My job is to make bold predictions and then take calculated risks with the objective of growing my clients\u2019 capital. Like everyone else with an opinion, here are some of my thoughts on the  New Normal for Business.\n  But before that, a disclaimer. I\u2019m not a crystal-ball gazer and have no powers beyond my understanding of macro trends and financial markets. Take this with a pinch of salt. Here goes.\n    \u2018Sh*t hits the fan so that fertilizer can rain\u2019. I don\u2019t think Jackie Viramontez, an obscure relationship \u2018expert\u2019 &amp; author, was thinking about global upheaval when she wrote those words. But relationships do have something in common with the current situation \u2013 heartbreak.\n  Many lives will be lost and millions more affected. Countries will introspect, businesses will realign. But as Jackie\u2019s 21st-century take on turning lemons into lemonade goes, there may be a silver lining. We may have to wait for the rain clouds to depart.\n    Having seen off the worst of the coronavirus wrath, China is limping back to normal. They will continue to remain a dominant exporter of raw material as well as finished goods, but businesses will ensure dependency on China\u00a0is reduced. With all the talk of this being China\u2019s moment, will they be able to capitalize?\n    Technology for many businesses, until today, was considered to be a support function with it being used as a means to get to an end. This is set to change as technology will now become the frontline requirement in most organizations. Its importance will be comparable to that of revenue-generating functions \u2013 sales and business development.\n  Trends will accelerate. Automation will gain momentum as the spend on sophisticated IT infrastructure outpaces human resources. Job creation will be limited with more offers being rolled out on a contractual basis than on a full-time basis. This sort of gig economy will emerge in the emerging markets as well as the more developed markets. Work from home will be the new normal. Firms in some sectors will realise that employees working from  ...\n    Non-environment friendly businesses will be looked down upon in terms of business valuations and focus on ESG (environmental, social, governance) will be a new way forward. Cities have already started thinking about  sustainable development models. New, more compact and agile value chains will emerge, as non-essential intermediaries are given a back seat. This will also drive employee/labour productivity and efficiency.\n    Businesses will rethink their strategy of focusing on sales without profitability/profitability growth. Organizations claiming hefty valuations just on the basis of sales growth will no longer\u00a0find buyers \u2013 focus on profit and profit growth will be the new normal.\n    That is, as long as the price of oil doesn\u2019t drop to $0 again. (FYI, only the expiring futures contract dropped to zero)\n  Data will become even more valuable, and with it, data misuse through AI will also become rampant. We\u2019re already seeing governments and private entities roll out contact tracing tools which have poor implementation and pose severe threats to data security and privacy. As these entities have realized, data can play a huge role in limiting the impact of viral phenomena \u2013 diseases, protests, misinformation\u2026.the list goes on.\n  Data and IT security will become even more important for businesses. Traditional businesses, including heavy industries, will find it difficult to survive without access to information that would help with optimization and extracting efficiency.\n    Asset heavy businesses like the ones related to oil, commodities, infrastructure will move to an asset-light model where financing of their activity would happen through public trusts, REITS, INVITs like structures. Equity financing would take over debt financing as businesses become reluctant to take on leverage.\n    Finally, big financial conglomerates with large balance sheet\u00a0exposure will become history. We\u2019ll see the emergence of specialized segmental lenders who will strive to make better lending decisions through AI &amp; social intelligence. Traditional lenders will exit the game.\n    Countries like China &amp; India stand to benefit from low crude-oil prices and a younger population which can kick in low-ticket consumption demand. While the world is currently dominated by right-wing politicians who propagate the concept of \u2018Make Local, Consume Local \u2019, the world will find comfort, once again, in the arms of capitalism. Free markets and abolishment of trade restrictions can be expected in the post-Covid  ...\n  Money will ultimately win. Most businesses that manage to survive the Covid-era financially, will have the ability to emerge victorious. As they say, \u201cYou need to live, to be in the game \u201d. Internet-based B2C businesses \u2013lending, financial services, need-based solutions will stand to gain. Once the world sees through this pandemic, there will be a jump in rental demand, entertainment, travel and tourism. The cement,  ...\n  The paper industry is one that has the highest chances of getting wiped out as the world looks to adopt environmentally friendly ways to live. As stated earlier, digital will be the new normal.\n    With respect to India, the discussion can be bifurcated into 2 parts \u2013 India\u2019s economy, and its stock markets.\n  The recovery of the underlying economy will be slow, and it will take around 2 years for normalcy to come back across sectors. While the overall economy might take a hit because of the government lockdown, some sectors are set to see immense growth in the post-Covid era \u2013 FMCG, B2C specialised lenders, gold-dependent companies, food retail and pharmaceutical companies to name a few.\n  Stock markets have a mind of their own, formed by the collective emotions + intelligence of millions. They are often skewed and aren \u2019t the best indicators of the underlying economy. Stock markets will have a strong recovery, not due to the fundamentals strength, but due to global liquidity which is available for almost free (as interest rates tend to near zero). Availability of debt capital will be scarce  ...\n    Like its counterparts across the globe, the Indian government has announced a slew of measures to prevent total collapse. However, it isn\u2019t enough. This works to alleviate some of the pain, not counter it. My 2 cents (or one barrel of oil) on what the government ought to do:\n  Loosen its purse and spend money on infrastructure development \u2013\u00a0 \u2018Rebuild India, Rejuvenate India\u2019\n  Public sector financial institutions need to be further capitalized and nudged by the RBI to lend out low-ticket loans below INR 1 Crore in the form of working capital to ensure that liquidity comes back into the system\n  Banking sector needs to be nudged to pass on rate cuts induced by RBI to the borrowers\n  Personal tax cuts &amp; tax holidays for 6 \u2013 12 months can be adopted to revive consumption, which will help spur economic growth\n    Before we end, let\u2019s look at some of the behavioural/societal impacts that Covid-19 might have.\n  During the course of the pandemic, people will be using digital medium for content and entertainment. Events that require massive gathering of people \u2013 sports, music festivals, theatre, etc. will take a hit for the next 12 months.\n  As the world overcomes this pandemic, discretionary demand will pick up as people become imprudent. Retail leverage in the world will hit new highs. The use of addictive material \u2013 tobacco, narcotics, alcoholic beverages will jump multifold.\n  The next 5 years are going to be the golden period for media and entertainment. 3D/4D chatrooms and conference rooms will emerge rapidly. The largest chunk of media spending will shift from television to digital. Print media will cease to exist.\n  Businesses will experience an increase in productivity due to reduced staff. Remote work will see an uptick. The burden on local transportation infra will ease. Fewer roads, less traffic &amp; pollution.\n    This may be the time to reset. Never before has the world come to a standstill where one can pick apart the many moving pieces \u2013 like Tom Cruise in Minority Report. We have the opportunity to rethink everything. If we do things right, we may be able to fix challenges that face humankind \u2013 environmental damage, inequality etc.\n  More importantly, we must ensure something like this never happens again. History says that humankind has never learnt from history. Let\u2019s hope that it\u2019s a thing of the past.\n  Disclaimer: This is a guest article.

"note_en": "Yes, you read that title right. While working on a new way to create finite state machines (fsm), I inadvertently designed a state machine you can execute at compile-time. With branching and everything. Today, allow me to pull you down my rabbit hole. It\u2019s always nicer with company down here.\n   I have this friend, you see, and he works in the c++ audio industry. DSP things and all that good stuff. Every time I show him a new piece of code I find interesting, he goes on and on about his \u201caudio callback\u201d and \u201chard real time\u201d and \u201cskipping a frame\u201d and and and. It is never-ending, I tell you. While discussing some of his current issues with a project he\u2019s working on, I recommended a fsm. It would fix all his problems and probably eradicate many state management bugs he has.\n State machines are great. I love them and you should too. When you  must have state, they are the way to go. However, remember that \u201caudio callback\u201d my dear friend keeps rambling about. Well, inside one of those, you cannot use  std::function. Apparently, you can\u2019t even use C function pointers. You really want your compiler to be able to inline everything it sees fit.\n And so, I set out to make an inlinable state machine. One without  std::function or function pointers. I want one anyways. [spoiler alert] That fsm isn\u2019t done yet, I\u2019ve been a little bit detracted from my goal.\n As my new fsm design evolved, all the while gazing absently at my sanity escaping, I realised what I had done. A  constexpr executable state machine, with many of the bells and whistles you\u2019d expect. Forgive me Bjarne for I have sinned.\n  Since I\u2019ll be going pretty deep in terms of c++ stuff later on, how about I start with a simple demonstration. This is a very theoretical example, used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system.\n The API, on Windows at least, isn\u2019t half bad if I do say so myself. I was going to write a poem for Microsoft\u2019s compiler, but my poetry skills threw an exception. Instead, here is a heartfelt letter to Visual Studio\u2019s compiler. Written at compile-time, of course.\n   Lets look at the code used to generate this wonderful and delightful masterpiece of literature. I will assume you\u2019ve worked with fsms before, since explaining that concept here will turn this already too long post into a way too short novel. I will also use the Visual Studio version of the code, as it is more readable and doesn\u2019t need any macro (clang and gcc need 1 macro, more on that later).\n  // Used to demonstrate branching.  #if defined(NDEBUG) \t static  constexpr  bool debug_build  = false; #else \t static  constexpr  bool debug_build  = true; #endif \t // Used to turn on/off messages. \t static  constexpr  bool assert_val  = true;\t enum  class   transition {\t\tdo_intro,\t\tdo_debug,\t\tdo_release,\t\tdo_paragraph,\t\tdo_outro,\t\tcount,  // count is required by fsm \t};\t enum  class   state {\t\tintro,\t\tdebug,\t\trelease,\t\tparagraph,\t\toutro,\t\tcount,  // count is required by fsm \t};\n Nothing special going on here. We have a few compile-time variables to branch on, and we define our letter writing state machine. We will start in  intro, then either transition to  debug or  release, then  paragraph and finally  outro.\n  fsm_builder &lt;transition, state &gt; builder;\t // intro \t auto intro_transitions\t\t\t = builder.make_transition &lt;transition ::do_debug, state ::debug &gt;()\t\t\t\t\t .make_transition &lt;transition ::do_release, state ::release &gt;();\t auto intro_events\t\t\t = builder.make_event &lt;fsm_event ::on_enter &gt;([]( auto &amp; machine) {\t\t\t\t\t\t  static_assert(assert_val,  &#34;Dear&#34;);\t\t\t\t\t\t  if  constexpr (debug_build) {\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  return machine. template trigger &lt;transition ::do_debug &gt;();\t\t\t\t\t\t }  else{  return  ...\n OK! Things are getting interesting. First we create an  fsm_builder. It needs to know about our  transition and our  state enum classes. I\u2019ve discussed this non-type template technique in the past  here. I really like it. It is very robust and all the user needs to do is make sure his enums finish with  count, which is a best-practice anyhow.\n With that builder, we create our transitions and events. The api is written in this \u201cchaining\u201d style to simplify usage. The  make_transition accept a  transition enum value and a  state enum value. This is the association between which transition go to which state. Calling a transition that isn\u2019t handled by a state will  static_assert.\n The events are self-explanatory. The fsm supports the standard  on_enter,  on_update,  on_exit and  on_enter_from. And the rare, yet infinitely powerful,  on_exit_to. You must provide the machine with lambdas, as function pointers are runtime. The first argument of each of your event lambdas is a reference to the state machine itself. This is quite useful with runtime machines, and as you\u2019ll see, with  constexprmachines as well. After that, you can add whichever argument you wish, since  ...\n  Then, depending on whether or not we are compiling in debug, we will trigger the  do_debug transition or the  do_release transition.\n The  on_update event will never be called, but if it were, it would return 0.\n Finally, just to show an example, we use the  on_exit_to event. If we exit to  debug, we print \u201cslow Visual Studio Compiler,\u201d. If not, we print \u201crelatively fast Visual Studio Compiler\u201d.\n Notice that the triggers  must return their value. The next state is encoded in the return value and the machine needs this. Also, clang and gcc complain about  .template, so I add  .template.\n Finally, we create the state using the builder\u2019s  make_state. We pass our  state::intro enum value in the template, and provide the transitions and events as input arguments.  In that order.\n The other states creation is more of the same. We first make our transitions, then our events and create states using those. Here they are.\n // debug \t auto debug_transitions  = builder.make_transition &lt;transition ::do_paragraph,\t\t\tstate ::paragraph &gt;();\t auto debug_events\t\t\t = builder.make_event &lt;fsm_event ::on_enter &gt;([]( auto &amp; m) {\t\t\t\t\t\t  static_assert(assert_val,  &#34;In debug mode,&#34;);\t\t\t\t\t\t  return m. template trigger &lt;transition ::do_paragraph &gt;();\t\t\t\t\t })\t\t\t\t\t .make_event &lt;fsm_event ::on_update &gt;(\t\t\t\t\t\t\t []( auto &amp;) {  return  1; });\t auto debug_state\t\t\t = builder.make_state &lt;state ::debug &gt;(debug_transitions,  ...\n  We define  on_enter events and  on_update events. The triggers occur on enter. Finally, the outro doesn\u2019t trigger anything or go anywhere, which will stop the \u201cexecution\u201d of the fsm. The builder has helpers  empty_t() and  empty_s() since you  must provide the adequate arguments when calling  make_state.\n This is quite verbose, but hopefully not too cryptic. Now, lets run this machine. Hold on to yer helmets!\n   We create the state machine using  make_machine and our previously created states. Then, we execute  init() which will call  on_enter of our starting state (the first state you pass to  make_machine). That will in turn execute its trigger, which will in turn proceed to the next state, which will execute its trigger, etc. Until we reach outro.\n   Not only does this compile, but since we are now in our  outro state, it correctly returns the answer to life : 42. Of course, since we executed the machine at compile-time, we can capture the resulting value as  constexpr, and I guess do some very fancy things with it!\n  This is great and all, but not very useful. In my unit tests, I have  an example of a state machine that conditionally fills up a  tuple at compile-time, according to its transitions. You can imagine building a plethora of objects at compile-time, dependent on some compile options provided by the user or the environment.\n You can also pass on the state machine as a template argument, so you can use it to conditionally initialize structs\u2019  static constexpr variables. For example.\n template  &lt; class   Machine &gt; struct my_obj {\t static  constexpr  auto my_conditional_variable  = Machine ::update();}; // Then, fill a tuple with types who&#39;ve been constructed conditionally. // Call triggers on the state machine to change value returned by .update().\n Fsms are good at managing state. Compile-time branching is state. So, if your software has a mess of  ifdefsand compile-time checks, this fsm should help you manage that. You can imagine a scenario where we are compiling cross-platform; windows, mac and linux. We have code that is generated dependent on the platform, in addition to a debug and release build type. Maybe we have some code that also checks c++ feature macros, etc. This becomes quite unmanageable in the long  ...\n You could define a state machine with 3 base states, windows, mac and linux. Then, define transitions to the code that needs to be generated. Lets say, an instantiate_renderer state. You can now override the behavior using  on_enter_from and  on_exit_to. Since the fsm doesn\u2019t have conditional transitions (aka transition guards), you could use different states for debug and release, so on and so forth.\n With a simple  init() call, you can generate all your compile-time branch dependent code, and make sure the behavior is well thought out, predictable, clear to understand and  static_asserts if you forgot to implement a required transition or state.\n  I\u2019ve already mentioned a few, but I feel the need to discuss the limitations of the design.\n One big trade-off is compile-times, clearly. The APIs are also very verbose and not as visually pleasing as with runtime state machines. Though I\u2019d say it is very reasonable considering what we are doing. Error messages, well\u2026 You know what you are getting into.\n Since I\u2019m unsure how useful this fsm is in reality, I\u2019m weary to add any more features to the machine. I do not want to over-complexify the code for something that seems very niche at this point.\n Another limitation is, whenever you call  trigger inside your fsm, you  must return the value. If you call  trigger during an update, you will need to capture the result as it is your new \u201cstate\u201d. For example :\n auto my_machine  = builder.make_machine(...).init();\t auto my_new_machine  = my_machine.update();  // If updates call triggers, you must capture the result.\n This makes the fsm much less useful overall, though I\u2019ve found quite a few ways around this while writing examples and unit tests.\n If you want to return a user value from your update events, while also calling  trigger, you could return a  tuple of both the trigger return value and a  std::optional user value. Since the return types are also yours to customize, you can really design a state machine that fits your needs.\n The MSVC compiler is very relaxed compared to clang and gcc. It allows for  static constexpr variables inside  static constexpr functions. This isn\u2019t \u201clegal\u201d C++, though I\u2019ve read there is a proposal for such a thing. Until we get this feature, on clang and gcc, you will need to use a macro  fea_event to pass on your events. The first argument is your event name, and the second is your event lambda. You later provide the event name to the  make_eventfunction. Like  ...\n fea_event(intro_onenter, []( auto &amp; machine) {\t\t static_assert(assert_val,  &#34;Dear&#34;);\t\t if  constexpr (debug_build) {\t\t\t return machine. template trigger &lt;transition ::do_debug &gt;();\t\t}  else {\t\t\t return machine. template trigger &lt;transition ::do_release &gt;();\t\t}\t});\tfea_event(intro_onupdate, []( auto &amp;) {  return  0; });\tfea_event(intro_onexitto_debug, []( auto &amp;) {\t\t static_assert(assert_val,  &#34;slow Visual Studio Compiler,&#34;); }); fea_event(intro_onexitto_release,  ...\n   Before I go into the details, it is mandatory you understand the concepts presented in  this great read. If you do not understand Michael Park\u2019s post, you will not understand what I am about to show. If you do however, then it\u2019s smooth sailing from here till the end of this never ending wall of text.\n Alright lets do this. I won\u2019t go every single line of code here, as you can find the full source on-line (links at the end). I just want to explain the major concepts.\n The state machine uses a very simple container I dubbed  tuple_map. Think of it as a compile-time  std::map, where you can query objects using types instead of runtime values. The tuple map is simply 2 tuples. One with keys, known to us and with which we\u2019ll do our searches, and one with values unknown to us (the lambdas). Here is a rough sketch of what it looks like, just to get an idea.\n struct tuple_map {\t // Search by template. \t template  &lt; class   Key &gt;\t static  constexpr  const  auto &amp; find() {\t\t constexpr size_t idx  = tuple_idx_v &lt;Key, keys_tup_t &gt;;\t\t return std ::get &lt;idx &gt;(_values);\t}\t // Does the map contain the key? \t template  &lt; class   Key &gt;\t static  constexpr  bool contains() {\t\t constexpr  bool ret  = tuple_contains_v &lt;Key, keys_tup_t &gt;;\t\t return ret;\t} private :\t // Used to find the index of the value inside the other tuple. std  ...\n tuple_idx_v and  tuple_contains_v are just a simple type trait you can find on stackoverflow. They would be nice additions to the standard.\n Next up, lets dive into our \u201cbuilders\u201d. The state machine encodes all its information into templates. That is why I use chaining apis. The builder will return a builder type, which can in turn return a new builder type with the appropriate information encoded in the templates. Here is a \u201cpseudo-c++\u201d example just to illustrate the idea.\n // Start here.  struct builder {\t auto make_transition() {\t\t // Start with a parent of type void. \t\t return transition_builder &lt; int,  void &gt;{};\t}}; // Then, return a builder which can recursively return builders // with data encoded in the template type.  template  &lt; class   Whatever,  class   Parent &gt; struct transition_builder {\t template  &lt; class   NewType &gt;\t auto make_transition() {\t\t // Recursively append the Parent information to the template. \t\t usingparent_t  ...\n Now, what if we were to encode in those templates, the information we need to build keys for our  tuple_map mentioned earlier? We could build up a  struct which contains all the transitions and their destination states. All we would need is some function to make sense of all this. Lets do just that.\n First, we define a key which contains the enum types and their non-type templates. We need this as the  tuple_map really doesn\u2019t play friendly with non-type templates. This is what we\u2019ll use later on to find transitions.\n template  &lt; class   TransitionEnum, TransitionEnum FromTransition &gt; struct fsm_transition_key {}; // Usage example : // TransitionEnum is the user enum class of transitions. // FromTransition is a non-type template of that enum, for example transition::do_outro. StateEnum my_target_state  = my_tuple_map.find &lt;fsm_transition_key &lt;TransitionEnum, FromTransition &gt;&gt;();\n Now back to the  transition_builder, we add an  unpack() api which will unroll all of our gathered transitions (encoded in our template types) and return a  tuple of that. This time, not pseudo-code.\n // We need, the type of the transition enum, the type of the state enum, // the transition enum value, the state enum value and the parent types.  template  &lt; class   TransitionEnum,  class   StateEnum, TransitionEnum FromT,\t\tStateEnum ToS,  class   Parent &gt; struct transition_builder {\t // Creates a new transition, with key NewFromT transition and value NewToS state. \t template  &lt;TransitionEnum NewFromT, StateEnum NewToS &gt;\t static  constexpr  automake_transition()  ...\n I tried to explain as best I can in the comments. Ultimately, we recurse through our types and build a  tuple&lt;tuple&lt;key, value&gt;&gt; for later. That will later be split into a  tuple&lt;keys...&gt; and a  tuple&lt;values...&gt; used to build our  tuple_map.\n  There is one last thing to go over, and that is really the key to making this whole thing compile-time. Everything needs to be  static constexpr. The \u201cmember variables\u201d, the functions, absolutely everything. That is why, as a user, you don\u2019t really need to use  constexpr when you create your transitions or your states. The objects don\u2019t really exist. Everything is encoded in templates, through  static constexpr.\n For example, lets take our  fsm_transition_builder and initialize a real  tuple_map with it. First, we need to convert the  tuple&lt;tuple&lt;key, values&gt;&gt; into 2 separate tuples.\n template  &lt; class   Builder &gt; constexpr  auto make_tuple_map() {\t // At compile-time, take the tuple of tuple coming from the \t // builder, iterate through it, grab the first elements of \t // nested tuples (the key) and put that in a new tuple, grab \t // the second elements and put that in another tuple. \t // Basically, go from tuple&lt;tuple&lt;key, value&gt;...&gt; to \t // tuple&lt;tuple&lt;key...&gt;, tuple&lt;values...&gt;&gt; \t // which is our map basically.  ...\n  OK here\u2019s what to keep an eye out for. First off, we don\u2019t even need to accept a variable as input. Since our  fsm_transition_builder only has  static constexpr functions, we only need to know its type. That is the magic described in mpark\u2019s blog post and how you write truly compile-time only code.\n std::apply didn\u2019t work here as it resulted in a non-constexpr expression. Instead, I use the descriptively named  tuple_expander5000, which takes a non-type  size_t and calls your lambda with some generated  std::integral_constant&lt;size_t, I&gt;.... This way, we can use the underlying index value to access a compile-time index  decltype(Idxes)::value. With that value, we  std::get each nested tuple, and we either  std::get&lt;0&gt; or  std::get&lt;1&gt;  ...\n  Notice this expansion is encoded in a struct, inside a  static constexpr auto unpack() function as well. I use local structs throughout the system, since they can encode the incoming templates in their  unpack() functions. We also need to do this for the  tuple_map, as it needs to have  static constexpr \u201cmember\u201d variables. Like so.\n // The real tuple_map.  template  &lt; class   KeysBuilder,  class   ValuesBuilder &gt; struct tuple_map {\t /* ... */ private :\t // Used to find the index of the value inside the other tuple. \t static  constexpr  auto _keys  = KeysBuilder ::unpack();  // &lt;--- look here \t // Your values. \t static  constexpr  auto _values  = ValuesBuilder ::unpack();  // &lt;--- and here \t using keys_tup_t  = std ::decay_t &lt; decltype(_keys) &gt;;\t using values_tup_t  = std ::decay_t &lt; decltype  ...\n  To initialize  static constexpr member variables, we cannot use a constructor. Not even a  constexpr constructor (those would be much more useful if the compiler could figure out  this has been initialized as  constexpr).\n To initialize our compile-time objects, we must pack data into template types. Later, we need to unpack that data calling a  static constexpr function, which only requires we know the type. Magic!\n  One final gripe and the necessary macro. Visual Studio happily compiles and executes the following.\n struct event_builder {\t template  &lt; class   Func &gt;\t static  constexpr  auto make_event(Func func)\t\t // Store a static constexpr version of the passed in user lambda, \t\t // until we need to unpack it later to copy it into a tuple_map. \t\t static  constexpr  auto f  = func;  // &lt;--- problematic line \t\t struct func_wrapper {\t\t\t // Return the user function. \t\t\t static  constexpr  auto unpack() {\t\t\t\t return f;\t\t\t}\t\t};\t\t using parent_t  =  /* not important right  ...\n However,  static constexpr variables inside  static constexpr functions aren\u2019t theoretically supported in c++. Even though I read about a  constexpr function relaxation proposals, I couldn\u2019t find the status of it. It has likely not been prioritized since use cases are few and far between. Anyhow, because of this language limitation we must provide a user macro which will wrap a user lambda into a  static constexpr function.\n // Do some pasting to make the struct name unique. // Create a struct which &#34;pastes&#34; the user lambda f in a static constexpr function. // Creates an instance of this struct, named name.  #define FEA_TOKENPASTE(x, y) x##y #define FEA_TOKENPASTE2(x, y) FEA_TOKENPASTE(x, y) #define fea_event(name, f) \\ \tstruct FEA_TOKENPASTE2( \\ \t\t\tFEA_TOKENPASTE2(fea_event_builder_, name), __LINE__) { \\ \t\tusing is_event_builder = int; \\ static constexpr  ...\n     In conclusion, we \u2019ve seen that where there \u2019s a will and a c++17 compiler, you can pretty much accomplish whatever the hell you want. I think I \u2019ve been through all the key points required to create a compile-time executable state machine in c++. If you understand all these template meta programming concepts well, sky is the limit! The full code is actually quite compact and readable, which goes to show how much the language has  ...\n Below is the github repo with my state machine collection, including this one. There are a few more examples in the unit tests. I only very recently made these public and they are far from final. I still need to go through and cleanup a lot of stuff (especially the state chart). Also, I haven\u2019t finished the  real runtime state machine that uses the  tuple_map design. It is in the works.\n    Thanks to  Michael Park for his innovative  static constexpr technique. Thanks to Philippe Sawicki for some amazing brain-storms on compile-time validated fsms.

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Rust is an  iron oxide, a usually red  oxide formed by the reaction of  iron and  oxygen in the presence of  water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by  spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances.  [1] Rust consists of hydrated  iron(III) oxides Fe 2O 3\u00b7 nH 2O and  iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH) 3).\n Given sufficient time, any iron mass,in the presence of water and oxygen, could eventually convert entirely to rust. Surface rust is commonly flaky and  friable, and it provides no protection to the underlying iron, unlike the formation of  patina on copper surfaces. Rusting is the common term for  corrosion of iron and its alloys, such as  steel. Many other  metals undergo similar corrosion, but the resulting oxides are not commonly called rust.  [2]\n Other forms of rust exist, like the result of reactions between iron and  chloride in an environment deprived of oxygen.  Rebar used in underwater  concrete  pillars, which generates  green rust, is an example. Although rusting is generally a negative aspect of iron, a particular form of rusting, known as &#34;stable rust,&#34; causes the object to have a thin coating of rust over the top, and if kept in low relative humidity, makes the &#34;stable&#34; layer  ...\n     Rust is a general name for a complex of oxides and hydroxides of iron,  [4] which occurs when iron or some alloys that contains iron are exposed to oxygen and moisture for a long period of time. Over time, the oxygen combines with the metal forming new compounds collectively called rust. Although rust may generally be termed as &#34;oxidation&#34;, that term is much more general and describes a vast number of processes involving the loss of  electronsor  ...\n The main catalyst for the rusting process is water. Iron or steel structures might appear to be solid, but water molecules can penetrate the microscopic  pitsand cracks in any exposed metal. The hydrogen atoms present in water molecules can combine with other elements to form acids, which will eventually cause more metal to be exposed. If chloride ions are present, as is the case with saltwater, the corrosion is likely to occur more quickly. Meanwhile,  ...\n  When iron is in contact with water and oxygen it rusts.  [5] If  salt is present, for example in  seawater or  salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, as a result of  electrochemical reactions. Iron metal is relatively unaffected by pure water or by dry oxygen. As with other metals, like aluminium, a tightly adhering oxide coating, a  passivation layer, protects the bulk iron from further oxidation. The conversion of the passivating  ferrous oxide  ...\n Other degrading solutions are  sulfur dioxide in water and  carbon dioxide in water. Under these corrosive conditions,  iron hydroxidespecies are formed. Unlike ferrous oxides, the hydroxides do not adhere to the bulk metal. As they form and flake off from the surface, fresh iron is exposed, and the corrosion process continues until either all of the iron is consumed or all of the oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, or sulfur dioxide in the system are removed  ...\n When iron rusts, the oxides take up more volume than the original metal; this expansion can generate enormous forces, damaging structures made with iron. See   economic effect for more details.\n  The rusting of iron is an electrochemical process that begins with the transfer of  electrons from iron to oxygen.  [7] The iron is the reducing agent (gives up electrons) while the oxygen is the oxidising agent (gains electrons). The rate of corrosion is affected by water and accelerated by  electrolytes, as illustrated by the effects of  road salt on the corrosion of automobiles. The key reaction is the reduction of oxygen:\n  Because it forms  hydroxide  ions, this process is strongly affected by the presence of acid. Indeed, the corrosion of most metals by oxygen is accelerated at low  pH. Providing the electrons for the above reaction is the oxidation of iron that may be described as follows:\n  The following  redox reaction also occurs in the presence of water and is crucial to the formation of rust:\n  In addition, the following multistep  acid\u2013base reactions affect the course of rust formation:\n    From the above equations, it is also seen that the corrosion products are dictated by the availability of water and oxygen. With limited dissolved oxygen, iron(II)-containing materials are favoured, including  FeO and black  lodestone or  magnetite (Fe 3O 4). High oxygen concentrations favour  ferric materials with the nominal formulae Fe(OH) 3\u2212 xO \u200b   x\u2044 2. The nature of rust changes with time, reflecting the slow rates of the reactions of solids.  [5]  ...\n Furthermore, these complex processes are affected by the presence of other ions, such as  Ca 2+, which serve as electrolytes which accelerate rust formation, or combine with the  hydroxides and  oxides of iron to precipitate a variety of Ca, Fe, O, OH species.\n The onset of rusting can also be detected in the laboratory with the use of  ferroxyl indicator solution. The solution detects both Fe 2+ ions and hydroxyl ions. Formation of Fe 2+ ions and hydroxyl ions are indicated by blue and pink patches respectively.\n   Because of the widespread use and importance of iron and steel products, the prevention or slowing of rust is the basis of major economic activities in a number of specialized technologies. A brief overview of methods is presented here; for detailed coverage, see the cross-referenced articles.\n Rust is  permeable to air and water, therefore the interior metallic iron beneath a rust layer continues to corrode. Rust prevention thus requires coatings that preclude rust formation.\n   Stainless steel forms a  passivation layer of  chromium(III) oxide.  [8]  [9] Similar passivation behavior occurs with  magnesium,  titanium,  zinc,  zinc oxides,  aluminium,  polyaniline, and other electroactive conductive polymers. [   citation needed]\n Special &#34; weathering steel&#34; alloys such as Cor-Ten rust at a much slower rate than normal, because the rust adheres to the surface of the metal in a protective layer. Designs using this material must include measures that avoid worst-case exposures, since the material still continues to rust slowly even under near-ideal conditions. [   citation needed]...\n    Galvanization consists of an application on the object to be protected of a layer of metallic  zinc by either  hot-dip galvanizing or  electroplating. Zinc is traditionally used because it is cheap, adheres well to steel, and provides  cathodic protection to the steel surface in case of damage of the zinc layer. In more corrosive environments (such as salt water),  cadmiumplating is preferred. Galvanization often fails at seams, holes, and  ...\n More modern coatings add aluminium to the coating as  zinc-alume; aluminium will migrate to cover scratches and thus provide protection for a longer period. These approaches rely on the aluminium and zinc oxides reprotecting a once-scratched surface, rather than oxidizing as a  sacrificial anode as in traditional galvanized coatings. In some cases, such as very aggressive environments or long design life, both zinc and a  coatingare applied  ...\n Typical galvanization of steel products which are to be subjected to normal day-to-day weathering in an outside environment consists of a hot-dipped 85\u00a0 \u00b5m zinc coating. Under normal weather conditions, this will deteriorate at a rate of 1\u00a0\u00b5m per year, giving approximately 85 years of protection. [   citation needed]\n   Cathodic protection is a technique used to inhibit corrosion on buried or immersed structures by supplying an electrical charge that suppresses the electrochemical reaction. If correctly applied, corrosion can be stopped completely. In its simplest form, it is achieved by attaching a sacrificial anode, thereby making the iron or steel the cathode in the cell formed. The sacrificial anode must be made from something with a more negative  ...\n Cathodic protection can also be provided by using a special-purpose electrical device to appropriately induce an electric charge.  [10]\n    Rust formation can be controlled with coatings, such as  paint,  lacquer,  varnish, or wax tapes  [11]that isolate the iron from the environment. Large structures with enclosed box sections, such as ships and modern automobiles, often have a wax-based product (technically a &#34;slushing oil&#34;) injected into these sections. Such treatments usually also contain rust inhibitors. Covering steel with concrete can provide some protection  ...\n As a closely related example, iron bars were used to reinforce stonework of the  Parthenon in  Athens, Greece, but caused extensive damage by rusting, swelling, and shattering the  marble components of the building. [   citation needed]\n When only temporary protection is needed for storage or transport, a thin layer of oil, grease, or a special mixture such as  Cosmoline can be applied to an iron surface. Such treatments are extensively used when &#34; mothballing&#34; a steel ship, automobile, or other equipment for long-term storage.\n Special antiseize lubricant mixtures are available, and are applied to metallic threads and other precision machined surfaces to protect them from rust. These compounds usually contain grease mixed with copper, zinc, or aluminium powder, and other proprietary ingredients. [   citation needed]\n   Bluing is a technique that can provide limited resistance to rusting for small steel items, such as firearms; for it to be successful, a water-displacing oil is rubbed onto the blued steel and other steel.\n   Corrosion inhibitors, such as gas-phase or volatile inhibitors, can be used to prevent corrosion inside sealed systems. They are not effective when air circulation disperses them, and brings in fresh oxygen and moisture.\n   Rust can be avoided by controlling the moisture in the atmosphere.  [12] An example of this is the use of  silica gel packets to control humidity in equipment shipped by sea.\n  Rust removal from small iron or steel objects by  electrolysis can be done in a home workshop using simple materials such as a plastic bucket filled with an electrolyte consisting of  washing soda dissolved in  tap water, a length of  rebar suspended vertically in the solution to act as an  anode, another laid across the top of the bucket to act as a support for suspending the object,  baling wireto suspend the object in the solution  ...\n Rust may be treated with commercial products known as  rust converter which contain  tannic acid or  phosphoric acid which combines with rust; removed with organic acids like  citric acid and  vinegar or the stronger  hydrochloric acid; or removed with chelating agents as in some commercial formulations or even a solution of  molasses.  [14]\n     Rust is associated with the degradation of iron-based tools and structures. As rust has a much higher volume than the originating mass of iron, its buildup can also cause failure by forcing apart adjacent parts \u2014 a phenomenon sometimes known as &#34;rust packing&#34;. It was the cause of the collapse of the  Mianus river bridgein 1983, when the bearings rusted internally and pushed one corner of the road slab off its support.  ...\n Rust was an important factor in the  Silver Bridge disaster of 1967 in  West Virginia, when a steel  suspension bridge collapsed in less than a minute, killing 46 drivers and passengers on the bridge at the time. The  Kinzua Bridge in  Pennsylvania was blown down by a  tornado in 2003, largely because the central base bolts holding the structure to the ground had rusted away, leaving the bridge anchored by gravity alone.\n Reinforced concrete is also vulnerable to rust damage. Internal pressure caused by expanding corrosion of concrete-covered steel and iron can cause the concrete to  spall, creating severe structural problems. It is one of the most common failure modes of reinforced concrete  bridges and buildings.\n   Rust is a commonly used  metaphor for slow decay due to neglect, since it gradually converts robust iron and steel metal into a soft crumbling powder. A wide section of the industrialized  American Midwest and  American Northeast, once dominated by  steel foundries, the  automotive industry, and other manufacturers, has experienced harsh economic cutbacks that have caused the region to be dubbed the &#34; Rust Belt&#34;.\n In music, literature, and art, rust is associated with images of faded glory, neglect, decay, and ruin.\n  A rusted but otherwise intact  Pineapple grenade that was previously buried in the ground near  Opheusden,  Netherlands\n  ^   Ankersmit, Bart; Griesser-Stermscheg, Martina; Selwyn, Lindsie; Sutherland, Susanne.  &#34;Rust Never Sleeps: Recognizing Metals and Their Corrosion Products&#34;  (PDF).  depotwijzer.

You can run them locally, or in the cloud via Google Colab.  Please read the caveats about the public endpoint below!\n Simple Analysis |    Example to query the citation graph for a specific paper and analyze it with pandas\n  Finding landmark papers - Papers with a large citations may be considered landmark papers. The ideas in such papers often form the foundation for incremental improvements. Given some arbitrary paper you&#39;re interested in, you may want to know which landmark papers you should study for the required background knowledge.\n Reference research - When writing a paper, you don&#39;t want to miss prior work. Looking through the citation graph for a related paper can help you find potentially interesting papers to read and cite.\n   The database is publicly available at  http://papergraph.dennybritz.com/v1/graphql, so  please be gentle with your queries! This is running on a small postgres server that I&#39;m paying for, so please don&#39;t overload it with automated scripts. Be nice :) As long as you&#39;re running queries by hand through notebooks everything should be fine.\n If you want to do lots of queries you should clone this repo and build the database yourself locally or in the cloud. Instructions for this are below. If you are running Kubernetes, you can also use the scripts in  deploy/.\n      If you want to build the database from scratch, you must download the full  S2 research corpus. The total compressed size is currently around ~120GB.\n     export DATABASE_URL=postgres://papergraph:papergraph@postgres:5432/papergraph export RUST_LOG=info  # Run the postgres docker containerdocker-compose up postgres  # Setup the datase and run migrationsdocker run --rm --network papergraph_default \\ -e DATABASE_URL \\ dennybritz/papergraph \\ diesel database setup\n Now that we have a postgres server with the right database schema running, we need to insert the data:\n # Assuming you downloaded the data into /data   # as shown in the AWS command aboveDATA_PATH=data/s2-research-corpus/s2-corpus-017.gz  # Repeat this for all files you want to insert  # This will take a while.

Stop the postgres docker process with  ctrl+c and run\n    papergraph is updated when new  data snapshots become available. This typically happens once a month. This means it will not contain all the latest papers.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 22:40:05", "tags": "graphql,\u5e26\u6709,ai,\u8bba\u6587,database", "title":

"note_en": "We had earlier  covered writing permission rules for few popular use cases. In this post we will look at writing permission rules for a multi-tenant system.\n   If your use case does not require per tenant roles (i.e. does not require point 2. above), then have a look at this  gist for a simpler implementation. We will loosely base this post on  predefined roles in Google cloud platform&#39;s (GCP) role-based access control system. GCP&#39;s role-based access control system is an interesting use case because it is not only multi-tenant, the roles within each tenant are also hierarchical.\n  In GCP, every resource type has roles associated with it. For example: access to Google cloud storage buckets is controlled using  storage_admin,  storage_editor,  storage_viewer roles. Similarly roles  compute_admin,  compute_editor,  compute_viewer, etc control access to the compute engines.\n Roles can be per resource as well. For eg: Each bucket has a  storage_admin,  storage_editor,  storage_viewer role associated with it. So a  storage_viewer for a given bucket can access only that bucket but a someone with a  global  storage_viewer role can view any bucket.\n Both global roles and per resource roles are hierarchical i.e a  Storage Admin can do anything a  Storage Editor can do, etc.\n Finally, every role is per project so a user can be  storage_admin in one project but be  storage_editor in another.\n     We have \u00a0a  projects table and a  users table to keep track of projects and users in the system.  roles table has the list of all roles along with hierarchy information.  user_project_roles maps users to their roles in a project and  user_bucket_roles maps users to their roles for a given bucket.\n We will also assume that we&#39;ve created a one-to-one relationship  user_bucket_roles from  storage_buckets to  user_bucket_roles. Note that keeping with the common convention, the relationship and the target table have the same name.\n Note: While GCP has many resources, in the above schema we have only included the  storage_buckets table. We will be looking at how to write permission rules for this table. Permission rules for other tables would be similar.\n Creating a  Storage Bucket in practice will probably involve coordinating between multiple services, allocating space, etc. The goal for this post is to only explain how to implement a system similar to GCP&#39;s role-based access control system. As such, we will conveniently ignore these complexities.\n  Similar to  Example 3 in the previous post we will flatten  user_project_roles and  user_bucket_roles into  flattened_user_project_roles and  flattened_user_bucket_roles using the gist below. This allows us to not worry about the hierarchy in the roles.\n For example if a user is assigned the  storage_admin role in the  user_project_rules table,  flattened_user_project_roles will have 3 rows assigning them:  storage_admin,  storage_editor and  storage_viewer.\n  Since we have modeled the roles in the database, we will use a single role called  user in Hasura to define permissions rules. We will assume that the session variable  X-Hasura-User-Id contains the  user_id and  X-Hasura-Project-Id contains the project that the user is trying to access.\n Permission rules on storage_buckets  A user can view a  storage_bucket if they have the  storage_viewer role on the given bucket or they have the global  storage_viewer role.\n  { &#34;_and&#34;: [ { &#34;_exists&#34;: { &#34;_table&#34;: { &#34;schema&#34;: &#34;public&#34;, &#34;name&#34;: &#34;flattened_user_project_roles&#34; }, &#34;_where&#34;: { &#34;_and&#34;: [ { &#34;user_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;X-Hasura-User-Id&#34; } }, { &#34;role_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;storage_viewer&#34; } }, { &#34;project_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;X-Hasura-Project-ID&#34; } } ] } } }, { &#34;project_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;X-Hasura-Project-ID&#34; } } ]}\n The above JSON uses the  _exists operator to check if there is a row in the  flattened_user_project_roles with the given role, project_id and user_id.\n  { &#34;user_bucket_roles&#34;: { &#34;_and&#34;: [ { &#34;user_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;X-Hasura-User-Id&#34; } }, { &#34;role_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;storage_viewer&#34; } } ] }}\n In the above rule  user_bucket_roles is a many-to-many relationship between  storage_buckets and  user_bucket_roles. Hasura evaluates the rule by fetching  user_bucket_roles for the current row and validating that  user_id and  role_id are equal to the given values.\n  { &#34;_or&#34;: [ { &#34;_and&#34;: [ { &#34;_exists&#34;: { &#34;_table&#34;: { &#34;schema&#34;: &#34;public&#34;, &#34;name&#34;: &#34;flattened_user_project_roles&#34; }, &#34;_where&#34;: { &#34;_and&#34;: [ { &#34;user_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;X-Hasura-User-Id&#34; } }, { &#34;role_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;storage_viewer&#34; } }, { &#34;project_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;X-Hasura-Project-ID&#34; } } ] } } }, { &#34;project_id&#34;:  ...\n  Update permissions would look the same as the select permissions except we would be using the role_id  storage_editor instead of  storage_viewer\n We also we need to prevent the user from updating the  project_id column of a bucket:\n   Delete permissions would again look the same as the select permissions except we would be using the role_id  storage_admin instead of  storage_viewer\n   { &#34;_exists&#34;: { &#34;_table&#34;: { &#34;schema&#34;: &#34;public&#34;, &#34;name&#34;: &#34;flattened_user_project_roles&#34; }, &#34;_where&#34;: { &#34;_and&#34;: [ { &#34;user_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;X-Hasura-User-Id&#34; } }, { &#34;role_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;storage_admin&#34; } }, { &#34;project_id&#34;: { &#34;_eq&#34;: &#34;X-Hasura-Project-ID&#34; } } ] } }}\n We also want the  project_id of the created bucket to be  X-Hasura-Project-Id. We can do this using column presets:\n   We also need rules that allow certain users to assign or remove the roles of other users. We can have roles  role_admin &amp;  role_viewer for being able to edit and view user roles respectively. Permission rules on  user_project_roles and  user_bucket_roles would then look similar to the insert permission rule on  storage_buckets with the role name changed.\n  In this post we&#39;ve seen how to implement permission rules for a full-fledged hierarchical multi-tenant system.

"note_en": "A question that has haunted me all my life is of identity. If I include my hobbying years, I have been programming for more than a decade. However, my interests have always been much wider\u2014economics, psychology, mathematics\u2014and the list of things that I have dabbled with is long and growing\u2014design, writing, vector art, photo editing, chess. I am a textbook dilettante. The idea of having a single pursuit for your whole life doesn\u2019t appeal to me, and perhaps, never will.\n That leads to my life \u2019s bigger puzzle: what is my \u2018calling \u2019? To put it in other words, what should I be doing happily for the next decade or two? Programming is what I have done for the longest while. I enjoy it to a good extent (at least, when there are less bureaucratic battles to fight), but for the past 5-6 years, I couldn \u2019t enjoy being called a programmer. In my hobbying years, I wasn \u2019t afraid to build something silly just for the fun of making it, but this all disappeared at some  ...\n I don\u2019t know when exactly it happened , but I know there were a few triggers. But the biggest one was the sheer dorkiness associated with coding.\n I started despising being a nerd, even though I was an a archetypical one. This happened gradually when I started to learn a bit more about the business side of things. In his famous essay,  Don\u2019t Call Yourself a Programmer, Patrick Mckenzie wrote:\n \u201cProgrammer\u201d sounds like \u201canomalously high-cost peon who types some mumbo-jumbo into some other mumbo-jumbo.\u201d If you call yourself a programmer, someone is already working on a way to get you fired.\n A programmer started to feel like someone who loves to code, but isn\u2019t business-smart enough to make bigger gains from it, a code monkey who doesn\u2019t understand the value of his/her own work. A silly side-project was beginning to sound like a wasted potential to make more money. After all, you could use all that time to build something commercially meaningful.\n At this point, my technical skills started to feel too normal, too commodotized to be important. After all, a person with half a brain can learn to do most of the CRUD stuff I did in a small timeframe (I know, considering all the nuances, this isn\u2019t true but that\u2019s what I believed). Yes, you get paid well regardless, but your peers did too, didn\u2019t they?\n I wanted to be more than a programmer. A business-savvy consultant, or perhaps, an entrepreneur. I didn\u2019t want the tag of a coder. I didn\u2019t want to waste my effort on side-projects unless they had the potential to make some money. I wanted to more business-esque things: reach out to talk to customers, or build a network, or create a brand.\n Long story short, all of that didn\u2019t work out. I have always enjoyed building things, but I wasn\u2019t great at other aspects of creating a business. And the constant pressure to build something great made me very stressful with scarcely any success to show for it. An example: In 2016, I wanted to build a content marketing analytics software. I tried to talking before building, got some interest, but I was too worn out by slow sales cycle and cluelessness about marketing.\n This can be a story of a \u2018the tech guy\u2019 too delusional to understand realities of creating an online business, or a startup wannabe doing the opposite of what needs to be done, but it\u2019s also of trying too hard to be someone else. Maybe I should have tried harder, survived a bit longer, but I distinctively remember feeling burned out by all the self-imposed pressure. It wasn\u2019t enjoyment in any sense.\n All this changed this year. This year has been about unlearning what I thought was important, understanding that I do enjoy programming and that there\u2019s nothing terrible about it.\n  There always more money to be made, but if you\u2019re comfortable with where you\u2019re, you don\u2019t need to engage in an endless chase to optimize hours and rates. That\u2019s not to say doing something like negotiating salary isn\u2019t important but you aren\u2019t a failure if you\u2019re rate isn\u2019t $200 / hour.\n  You\u2019ve a higher chance of success when you\u2019re making things for fun, solving your own problems. And not stressing yourself about succeeding. Again, completely opposite might be true for someone else.\n  Advice from successful people should be given a lot of weight, but much of it is context-dependent, and you can ignore something that isn\u2019t applicable to you.\n  As much as  growth-mindset is true, you\u2019re genetically predisposed to be better at certain things, while slightly worse at others. An example: When I see sales people around me, I notice that they absolutely love to talk. I do too, but I find calls and meetings a bit exhausting and need time to get back up. Certainly, it\u2019s not something I would enjoy doing for a living.\n So, after a long, hard break, I have started doing things for fun again. Recently, I built:\n A blogging system entirely in Notion using unofficial  Notion API. You just to have to write a post in a folder and everything from creating a post to publishing will be taken care of. This post is published using that.\n  A bunch of automation using  Hammerspoon. For eg, to copy path of Finder\u2019s current location so that it\u2019s easier to go to that directory in CLI.\n    Foundation stone of a personal dashboard.

"note_en": "Death Stranding, the newest video game from the developer Hideo Kojima, was introduced to the world in the summer of 2016 on a stage at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the gaming industry \u2019s annual trade-show extravaganza. The event was what the industry calls a press conference, but this particular spectacle more closely resembled the scene in \u201cKing Kong \u201dwhen the beast is displayed to the public in a Broadway theater. A live orchestra struck up a blaring John Williams-style score as the  ...\n Kojima proceeded to play perhaps  the strangest three and a half minutes of videoever to grace the E3 stage. Keep in mind that this is a venue where cybernetic dinosaurs and giant-felling samurai are par for the course. The video opened with a William Blake poem, the first lines of \u201cAuguries of Innocence, \u201dthen cut to a close-up of highly realistic computer-generated sand. The camera floated over the sand, revealing a jumble of dead crabs. Handprints appeared in the sand and then filled up, inexplicably,  ...\n There was no hint as to the story, the gameplay or even the genre of the game. It was all mood and symbol and Norman Reedus\u2019s shiny posterior. It was more like something you\u2019d see at MoMA than at E3. But the crowd went wild.\n The reaction might not have been much different if he had shown a blank screen. Kojima is one of a very few video-game developers who can generate enormous anticipation for a game based on his name alone. Over his 30 years in the industry, he has come to exert the sort of reality-distorting effect on gamers that Steve Jobs did on electronics consumers, with an almost supernatural ability to persuade people to get onboard with ideas that would seem totally preposterous coming from anyone else.  ...\n Given the idiosyncrasies of his previous creations, the audience could only wonder at what he might do with so much freedom. The bizarre trailer was perfectly calibrated to stoke that curiosity while leaving it maddeningly unfulfilled.  Just trust me, it said.  It\u2019s going to be good.\n Over the next three years, Kojima continued to be maddeningly obscure in teasing the game. Following the Death Stranding hype cycle was a bit gamelike in itself, as fans were forced to construct some mental image of the game out of Kojima\u2019s sporadic hints. He talked a lot during those years, and everything he said seemed only to confuse the picture. \u201cIt would be like telling you who\u2019s the killer in a mystery novel,\u201d  he told the website Digital Spy, when pressed for specifics.\n At times, he seemed to be describing a fairly conventional action game, with vehicles and combat and a world to explore. At others, Death Stranding sounded like nothing that had come before. Kojima said it would initiate an entirely new genre, the \u201cstrand \u201dgenre: \u201cYou will attempt to bridge the divides in society, \u201dhe wrote on Twitter, \u201cand in doing create new bonds or \u2018Strands \u2019with other players around the globe. Through your experience playing the game, I hope you \u2019ll come to understand  ...\n In another statement to Digital Spy, Kojima said he was inspired by \u201cThe Rope, \u201da short story by the Japanese novelist Kobo Abe. In the story, Abe writes that the first tools humanity invented were the stick and the rope \u2014the first an instrument of violence, meant (as Kojima put it) to \u201ckeep away bad things, \u201dthe second an instrument of connection, meant to \u201ckeep good things close to you. \u201dIn Death Stranding, \u201cyou will be able to use what will be the equivalent of sticks, \u201dKojima went on.  ...\n The gaming press reported all these utterances with good-natured incomprehension. In some corners of the internet, though, you could sense an undercurrent of skepticism beginning to rise as the game \u2019s release drew closer. There were whispers that it might be a self-indulgent mess, that Kojima had gone entirely off the deep end. The phrase \u201cI still don \u2019t know what this game is about \u201dbecame a sort of meme in the comments section under many Death Stranding-related YouTube videos and blog  ...\n As for me, I spent three years obsessed with this game that its own creator claimed not to understand. I pored over news and speculated with my gamer friends. I became one of Kojima \u2019s 2.8 million followers on Twitter, where he interspersed updates from the Death Stranding set with an endless stream of trivia about his life \u2014what food he ate, what movies he watched, what books he read. The more information I had, the more I fixated on what I didn \u2019t know. Last fall, as the release date finally  ...\n  How do you  explain HideoKojima to someone who has never picked up a PlayStation controller? His admirers have often compared him to filmmakers: Quentin Tarantino, David Lynch, George Lucas, James Cameron. Each comparison has its merits. Like Lucas, Kojima is inseparable from a beloved franchise, in Metal Gear Solid, that has achieved mythic status among fans; like Tarantino, he cheekily shows off his virtuo\u00adsity through postmodern tricks of deconstruction and self-referentiality. The narratives  ...\n Perhaps more notable than his resemblance to any particular film director is the fact that such a comparison would be made at all. Video-game creators tend not to be recognized, much less celebrated; while most film buffs can name the directors of their favorite movies, appreciation of even the best video games often begins and ends with the quality of the experience playing it. The defining characteristic of video games is their interactivity. When you play a game, the thing that sticks  ...\n When you play a Kojima game, though, you know you are playing a Kojima game \u2014 and not just because his name tends to be all over them. The critic Jeremy Parish, one of the sharpest writers on Kojima,  has noted that with each game in the Metal Gear Solid series, from Metal Gear Solid (1998) through Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain (2015), \u201cKojima has been drawing closer to realizing some platonic ideal of \u2018video games\u2019 that exists only in his mind.\u201d\n It is not easy to sum up Kojima \u2019s oeuvre. There are really two ways of looking at him, and they don \u2019t totally fit together. The first is that Kojima is a brilliant innovator who has managed to consistently expand the notion of what video games can be for more than three decades. The Metal Gear Solid series enshrined his reputation as the father of a new genre, \u201cstealth \u201daction, based around sneaking and subterfuge rather than the run-and-gun gameplay favored by most action games then  ...\n Kojima \u2019s second major innovation was the way he applied cinematic storytelling to console video games. Hollywood-style narratives had been tried in games before, but they tended to founder on unimaginative stories, sub-B-movie acting and jarring shifts in visual style between the gameplay and the noninteractive narrative sequences ( \u201ccutscenes, \u201din video game lingo). Dylan Holmes, in his book on video-game story\u00adtelling, \u201cA Mind Forever Voyaging, \u201dhas noted that Metal Gear Solid created  ...\n But then there \u2019s that second, trickier story: about Kojima the egotist, a man grown too infatuated with his own ideas. To praise the Metal Gear Solid series, you must hack through a thick forest of caveats. In addition to being innovative, graphically stunning and meticulously designed, the games are deeply weird and frequently stupid. The game writer Anthony Burch summed up this quality of Kojima \u2019s work perfectly in a book he wrote with his sister, Ashly Burch, about their complicated  ...\n  At its best, what I have come to think of as Kojima Weirdness gives the games a personality seldom found in a big-budget action game. Playing them can feel like exploring the deepest recesses of an obsessive and endlessly imaginative mind. At its worst, though, Kojima Weirdness can leave you shaking your head at just how ridiculous that mind can be. There \u2019s the recurring gag in which characters soil themselves. There are the twisting, sprawling plots that leave you with only the  ...\n \u201cYeah, I do,\u201d the main character replies. \u201cI think at any time, any place, people can fall in love with each other.\u201d\n On balance, I \u2019ve found that the off-kilter writing tends to add to the charm of the series. The same can \u2019t be said for its treatment of women. In the first game, the protagonist, Solid Snake, hits his two female allies with dumb pickup lines within the first 30 seconds or so of meeting them. There \u2019s a whole mission in which you have to identify your sexy sidekick, Meryl, who is disguised as an enemy soldier, by recognizing her backside, which Snake checked out upon meeting her  ...\n   Over time, the series became a flash point in a growing debate around sexism in video games. By 2013, when Kojima revealed that one heroine of Metal Gear Solid V would be a busty female sniper named Quiet, clad in a bikini and torn stockings, it provoked outrage and dismay, even from die-hard fans. \u201cOnce you recognize the secret reason for her exposure, you will feel ashamed of your words &amp; deeds,\u201d  Kojima tweetedin response to the wave of online criticism. The \u201csecret reason  ...\n Even so, the Metal Gear Solid series delivered certain incredible pleasures that no other video games have \u2014pleasures that are difficult to isolate or define. It \u2019s perhaps easiest to explain them in terms of individual moments. Like the mind-blowing moment, in the first Metal Gear Solid, when a floating psychic named Psycho Mantis shows off his psychokinetic powers by moving your controller: After you place it on a flat surface, at his instruction, the game uses the controller  ...\n The more that was revealed about Death Stranding, the more it began to seem like  an entire game made up of such moments, in which you find yourself experiencing something you never expected you would in a video game \u2014something you never even thought to want to experience in a video game, but you do, and somehow it works, and you are almost delirious with surprise and joy, and the experience lodges in your brain like a tiny meteor strike, such that every time you wonder at the  ...\n By the time I met Kojima in October, at his offices in Tokyo, I had played roughly 17 hours of Death Stranding, having received an early-review code two days earlier. It was one of the most fascinating and compelling but also frustrating and boring experiences of my long gaming career. In Death Stranding, you assume the role of Sam Porter Bridges (Reedus), a delivery man working in a postapocalyptic America that has dissolved into scattered communities in underground bunkers  ...\n The plot of the game is preposterous, but its mood is not. The world of Death Stranding is like a depressed survivalist \u2019s fever dream. It \u2019s an unsettling mix of high technology, supernatural horror and pristine wilderness. The game \u2019s vision of postapocalyptic America is a forbidding volcanic landscape of snow-capped peaks and mossy lava fields. Crystal-clear rivers testify to a near-total lack of civilization outside the angular gunmetal buildings that mark the entrances  ...\n The process of gaining access to Kojima \u2019s office had inspired in me a similar sense. In place of a reception area, there was a small white room with a round pillar at the center. A white panel on the left wall silently slid open to reveal a man in a black Kojima Productions T-shirt \u2014this was Aki Saito, Kojima \u2019s personal translator and the communications head of Kojima Productions. Through the door, I was greeted by a narrow hallway with a white, disco-style light-up floor  ...\n The hallway, which bears a striking resemblance to the interior of the ill-fated spaceship in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey, \u201dstands as a testament to Kojima \u2019s twin obsessions of film and outer space. As a child, Kojima dreamed first of being an astronaut, then a filmmaker. He got his spacefaring dreams from watching the Apollo 11 moon landing and his filmmaking dreams from his father, a huge movie buff. His family had a tradition of watching a movie every night; by the time he  ...\n We reached the end of the hall, and a door slid open, and there was a small woman with dyed pink hair in a large black hooded sweatshirt. This was Ayako Terashima, Kojima \u2019s personal assistant; her fans know her as Touchy! on Twitter, where she has more than 50,000 followers and provides running updates on Kojima \u2019s life. Tera\u00adshima said that Kojima wished to show me a new trailer for Death Stranding that he had just edited. Saito and a Sony P.R. rep led me into a conference  ...\n Saito left, and a few minutes later he returned with Kojima. A youthful 56, Kojima walked in with rapid, precise steps and shook my hand. He was dressed in a light sweater and jeans. He had on thick, round blue plastic glasses; a scruff of beard lent him the nerdy-cool air of the intellectual aesthete. Saito, as he translated for him, revealed a dry sense of humor and a sort of mind-meld with his boss. He translated Kojima \u2019s Japanese into English so quickly that to an  ...\n I awkwardly presented Kojima with a bag of David Lynch-branded coffee, which I had bought at Whole Foods back home. I knew he was a huge Lynch fan; in talking about his preference for being directly involved in every aspect of the creative process, he once said he would \u201crather be a David Lynch than a Spielberg.\u201d\n  Kojima grinned and thanked me with what seemed to be genuine enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted this,\u201d he said.\n Kojima excused himself and went back into the office to prep the trailer. After a few minutes, Saito took me in. It was a large room full of white tables, around which sat dozens of people at PCs. Toward the center of the room was a large TV on a stand in front of a stylish open kitchen area. As Kojima sat down, he warned me that there might be spoilers in the trailer.\n Boy, were there. Even after 17 hours of play, I had seen almost nothing in this trailer. I was surprised, given that reviewers had been explicitly forbidden to even mention anything that happened after the third \u201cepisode\u201d of the game; with this trailer, Kojima was essentially planning to break his own embargo.\n But spoilers be damned, Kojima was going to make the trailer he wanted. Among other things, Kojima is a pioneer of the video-game trailer. A trailer for Metal Gear Solid 2 is  still renowned for the impact it made at E3 back in 2000. A second trailer, presented the following year, ended simply with the word \u201cSubmerges\u201d; afterward, Kojima granted no interviews for six months, letting the clip speak for itself.\n When we were back in the conference room, Kojima told me that the first inkling of Death Stranding came to him about 10 years ago, when he first learned about the phenomenon of mass stranding, in which dolphins and whales mysteriously beach themselves in huge numbers. He liked the phrase and also the image: creatures from another world, washed up on a beach. The idea returned a few years later and coalesced into something more tangible: a melancholy image of a man  ...\n \u201cGuillermo del Toro called me, and he said, \u2018There\u2019s going to be a guy that contacts you called Hideo Kojima, and he\u2019s going to say we\u2019re going to do a game together, and just say yes,\u2019\u201d Reedus told me. \u201cI said, \u2018Who is he?\u2019 And he just said, \u2018Say yes.\u2019\u201d\n The image of a stranded man had an added resonance for Kojima at the time. Earlier that year, he left Konami. \u201cI was almost naked, starting a new company, \u201dhe said in our interview. \u201cI had nothing, so I thought that that image fit perfectly with my image. \u201dHis split with Konami shocked the whole industry, and the reason for it has never been revealed; Kojima hasn \u2019t discussed it, and his P.R. rep told me he wouldn \u2019t answer questions about Konami. Fans and sympathetic  ...\n \u201cI have always had this habit of feeling lonely,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat\u2019s why I create these things in the first place.\u201d Kojima was born in Tokyo in 1963; when he was a year and a half old, his family moved away, eventually settling in the city of Kobe. He became a latchkey kid, he said. Whenever he came home to an empty house after school, he would turn on all the lights and the TV for company.\n Television wasn \u2019t just a distraction; he learned from it. He loved travel shows in particular, which taught him about the world outside Japan. Throughout our interview, Kojima expressed a desire for Death Stranding to offer a similarly edifying experience. He hoped Sam \u2019s journey of reconnection might offer players a metaphor with which to understand a world he described as \u201ccoming apart. \u201d\u201cIt \u2019s not just America, but the problem with the E.U. in Europe, or the  ...\n One of the most interesting aspects of Death Stranding is its multiplayer feature. Many games let you play along with other people, either killing them or cooperating with them or both. In Death Stranding, you don \u2019t quite do either; the presence of other players is felt only indirectly, through items they leave that litter the landscape. You can help them by delivering cargo they \u2019ve dropped, or by leaving useful items or buildings behind. As thanks, you can  ...\n  \u201cYou lose this feeling of solitude when you find out there\u2019s the same people all over the world,\u201d Kojima said. \u201cYou aren\u2019t alone.\u201d I gathered that Kojima imagined this as a more positive alternative to the embattled feeling he gets from the internet. \u201cI go on the internet \u2014 it\u2019s all connected, and everyone is battling each other,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish people would use the technology in a different way.\u201d\n He clearly was worried about how Death Stranding would be received online. \u201cIt \u2019s not really easy to swallow, \u201dhe said. But this was just as he intended: \u201cI want people to feel, \u2018What the hell is this?. \u201dHe suggested that the immediacy of social media exerts a kind of conservatism on popular taste. \u201cRecently there \u2019s social media, and people will kind of start a negative campaign, \u201dhe said. \u201cThey might say, \u2018I don \u2019t really understand it, I \u2019m just stuck, so  ...\n I asked about the criticism he received over the Quiet episode and over the Metal Gear Solid series\u2019s treatment of women more generally. He seemed to acknowledge that his thinking had evolved, even while defending the way he did things in the past. \u201cEntertainment moves on with the era,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cOf course, I can\u2019t do the same thing today. The era is moving; it\u2019s totally different.\u201d\n I should have pointed out that 2015, when Metal Gear Solid V came out, wasn \u2019t all that long ago, but it was clear that my interview was almost up. Soon the Sony P.R. rep told me that there was time for only one more question. Kojima \u2019s response had reminded me of a comment he once made about the timebound nature of video games. He had compared playing an old video game to driving a 30-year-old car \u2014it would get you to your destination, but the ride wouldn  ...\n This was a truth I had come to recognize when playing some of the old Metal Gear Solid games, whose inelegant controls and outdated graphics now significantly dampened the experience for me. I said that it was interesting he was trying to create an enduring experience through an artwork that, in 30 years, perhaps people would no longer find engaging.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not about making people play Death Stranding 30 years from now,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to make them relive the memories they had, or the impression they had when playing for a long time.\u201d\n The interview was over. Saito handed me a bag full of Kojima Productions swag. Kojima rose, and I shook his hand and thanked him for his time. Then he was back out the door.\n Throughout his career, Kojima \u2019s work has confronted gamers with the question of why they play. Do you want to blow off some steam by blasting away a thousand alien soldiers while luxuriating in the most badass graphics you \u2019ve ever seen? Kojima \u2019s games may not be for you. Do you want to experience the singular creative vision of an uncompromising auteur while luxuriating in the most badass graphics you \u2019ve ever seen? Well, you are probably already a  ...\n One of the defining characteristics of all of Kojima \u2019s games is their narrative ambition. Many video-game stories are perfunctory affairs; the only purpose of the plot is to give a basic motivation for the action. The Metal Gear Solid games, by contrast, try to convey stories of operatic scope and dizzying complexity. Your adventure quickly departs from the straight\u00adforward hero \u2019s journey found in many video games and descends into a labyrinthine techno-military  ...\n In Death Stranding, the story is stripped down by comparison, the ambiguity of its narrative situations more subtle. On the one hand, your journey to \u201cmake America whole, \u201das the former president tells you at the beginning, seems synonymous with progress. You deliver the scattered survivors much-needed medicine, supplies and information. With each node of the Chiral Network you bring online, the surrounding area lights up on your map, and you can now  ...\n  After my interview with Kojima, I spent much of the next few days sequestered in my tiny hotel room in Tokyo, playing Death Stranding on the cheap TV. Once I started guiding Sam along his journey, I found Death Stranding to be not as radically unfamiliar as Kojima \u2019s prerelease hype had suggested. In many ways it hews to the popular conventions of the \u201copen world \u201dgenre \u2014a term that arose to describe titles like Rockstar Games \u2019s famed Grand Theft  ...\n But there  wassomething fundamentally new, I found as I continued to play. Death Stranding manages to transform an act that most open-world games take for granted \u2014the act of traveling from one point to another \u2014into a complicated and meaningful experience. Although you eventually gain access to vehicles, much of the time walking is your only mode of transit. In most games, walking is a mindless chore: You can watch the scenery go by, but there \u2019s  ...\n For a porter, Sam is very unsteady on his feet. Every rock or dip in the terrain can cause him to stumble and fall. Going up or down steep slopes frequently results in a slide amid a shower of rocks and cargo. Sam will topple over in the middle of fording a river if his fast-draining stamina gauge runs out. In order to keep him from falling, you must constantly be ready to pull the left or right trigger, which makes him grab the corresponding strap  ...\n Strangely, I found, this labor made me empathize with Sam to a degree that I had never experienced with a video-game character. I first noticed this near the beginning of the game, when I took shelter in a cave from a B.T.-riddled rainstorm. I didn \u2019t really have any idea what I was doing; a marker off in the distance labeled \u201cPort Knot City \u201dseemed to be where I needed to go. I headed out of the cave and down a path that descended into a ravine.  ...\n A blue indicator below Sam appeared, telling me to pull the right and left triggers on my controller to regain balance, but it vanished as quickly as it had appeared. The path leveled out. Then it descended even more steeply, and Sam began speeding up again. His steps got shorter and quicker as he tried desperately to slow his pace.\n The balance indicator appeared again, but before I could react Sam stumbled over a small rock and went head over heels in five jarring somersaults before regaining his footing and coming to a halt. The boxes I\u2019d been carrying on my back had flown off during the tumble and lay strewn behind me, flashing ominously.\n This left me minorly stunned. I had never tripped in a video game. I\u2019ve  fallena lot: into pits in Super Mario Bros., off the top of a roof of a gutted apartment building in the online shooter PlayerUnknown \u2019s Battlegrounds, off cliff faces in the treasure-hunting adventure series Uncharted. Because it \u2019s self-inflicted, a fall is frustrating in a way that being killed by an enemy isn \u2019t. But usually when you fall, you fall very far, to your death,  ...\n One of the first missions forces Sam to carry his own adoptive mother \u2019s corpse on his back. The load is so unwieldy that even a slight change in direction sends Sam stumbling. Again and again I came close to falling, and each time my heart leapt into my chest. I knew that if I took things slowly I would make it, but it was hard to break my ingrown habits. In most games, whenever you have distance to cover, you tend to run, especially because  ...\n I ultimately did fall with the corpse on my back, while impatiently clambering over some rough terrain. The rumble from the controller as Sam sprawled flat on his face sent a jolt of sickening horror up my spine. As Sam struggled to his feet, I took some small comfort in the fact that he had fallen straight forward, so the corpse didn \u2019t actually touch the ground while he was carry\u00ading it to the incinerator. I was fully immersed in Sam \u2019s bleak  ...\n In our interview, I had asked Kojima about the unusually involved process of walking in the game. He said: \u201cA game is basically not your normal day life. You\u2019re supposed to be a hero. You\u2019re super fast, or you can jump high, or you can fly. That\u2019s the beginning of games, right? But in our game, it\u2019s like a blue-collar worker. You have to watch your step, otherwise you fall, and there\u2019s no character like that.\u201d\n  He went on: \u201cIt\u2019s like a normal self of yourself, where you have to balance, that saves the world. It\u2019s totally different than the characters or the heroes that have appeared in other games. That\u2019s my approach.\u201d He said he wanted to make players ask themselves, \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d\n A few weeks after my visit with Kojima in Tokyo, I attended a launch event for Death Stranding in Manhattan. A hundred or so people assembled at a large exhibition space in Chelsea, making the whole thing seem more like the opening of a fancy conceptual-art show than the introduction of a video game. A replica of the white hall from Kojima Productions had been constructed at the entrance; snazzily dressed people sipped cocktails and wine.  ...\n \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she said, shaking her head. (She was there because her husband\u2019s son works for Sony Music and helped with the soundtrack.)\n Kojima roamed the gallery wearing a black blazer over a T-shirt, black pants and black-and-white basketball sneakers. A small crowd was trailing him, including a personal cameraman there to document his every move. He stood for much of the night on an elevated stage, hamming it up with members of the cast as guests and media snapped their photographs.\n When I was finally able to get close to him, I asked how he was feeling, now that Death Stranding had been revealed to the world. He smiled and jumped into a minute dissection of the reviews, which had been published a few days earlier. They were generally positive, though substantially less so than those received by any of the games in the Metal Gear Solid series. (Death Stranding has an 82 out of 100 on the review-aggregation site Metacritic,  ...\n He had a theory about the relative difference between European and American reviews. \u201cIn America, they\u2019re used to shooters, so they don\u2019t gulp it down,\u201d Kojima said. \u201cIt\u2019s OK; everyone can evaluate what they want.\u201d He noted that he saw a similar resistance to the stealth concept in the Metal Gear Solid games at the time. \u201cIn three to five years, we will see what people will say.\u201d\n Five years is practically geological time in the video-game industry, but then again, Death Stranding is a game that does not adhere to accepted time conventions. I played as fast as I could, forgoing almost all the side missions, reading barely any of the hundreds of emails you receive that fill in the plot, zooming from one delivery to the next, and it still took me over 60 hours to beat, well above the usual (30 to 40) of most big-budget  ...\n And it seemed as if whatever pleasure I got was directly related to how much I personally struggled. About halfway through the game, there is a brutal section in which you have to make a series of deliveries in a mountain area covered in thigh-high snow. The snow makes walking excruciatingly slow. You can \u2019t run. Sam walks with wide, sloughing steps, pushing against the snow, his face crystallizing in a mask of ice. For two hours straight,  ...\n In \u201cHamlet on the Holodeck, \u201dher classic study of computer-based narrative, the literary theorist Janet Murray explores the narrative potential of journeying through a virtual world. She cites the story of Odysseus \u2019escape from the Cyclops by getting him drunk and sneaking his men out underneath a herd of sheep. Games, she writes, can convey a similar drama of escape by using well-designed puzzles to trap players in space until they  ...\n Sam\u2019s journey reminded me of another character who is glimpsed briefly in the Odyssey: poor Sisyphus, rolling his rock up the hill. He, too, was involved in a struggle against the earth itself. Is it pleasurable? Well, as Camus would say, it\u2019s all how you look at it: \u201cThe absurd man, when he contemplates his torment, silences all the idols.\u201d\n Death Stranding had made me contemplate every exhausting step. At many points, I reflected that if I didn\u2019t have to finish the game in order to write this article, I would have quit. But I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t \u2014 because I would have missed out on one of the most beautiful and unsettling experiences I\u2019ve ever had in a game.\n It came during a mission in which I was tasked with recovering a machine that a paleontologist had been using to collect samples from a tar pit. The valley was wide and flat, pocked with gaping calderas that blew enormous plumes of steam into the air, like sideways clouds drifting into the sky. After hours of white and gray and blinding snow in the mountains, gazing on the relative liveliness of the valley, the dark green grass  ...\n But when I respawned, there was a huge smoldering crater in the spot where I had died, about a mile wide and a quarter mile deep: a void left by my body. A bit shaken, I collected the paleontologist \u2019s machine and headed back into the mountains. Turning the corner in a wide path, I heard a far-off rumbling sound. Three enormous boulders tumbled slowly down the side of the mountain. For a second I thought they were going to run  ...\n The ups and downs of the previous hour or so, from the pit of boredom to the height of terror and down again to quiet, surreal beauty, had left me overwhelmed. This is not a typical feeling you get from a video game. Video games usually make you feel powerful. It \u2019s film that makes you surrender to the spectacle on the screen. What makes Death Stranding a powerful experience is how it uses its agency-granting power to make you  ...\n After the boulders came to rest, I had the feeling of an eerie presence, something alive in the rough stone spheres that had come to rest in the snow in front of me. I felt as if my entire being had been slightly rearranged, at a molecular level.
