"note_en": "It aims to provide both user-friendly and powerful interfaces for users, aswell as extreme scalability to deal with repositories containing many millionsof files and many millions of commits.\n   EdenSCM&#39;s scalability goals are to ensure that all source control operationsscale with the number of files in use by a developer, and not with the size ofthe repository itself. This enables fast, performant developer experienceseven in massive repositories with many long files and very long commithistories.\n  The  eden CLI was originally based on Mercurial, and shares many aspects of the UIand features of Mercurial.\n   The  eden CLI currently builds and runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows. The setup.py script is the main interface for building the CLI.\n   Despite having originally evolved from Mercurial, EdenSCM is not a distributedsource control system. In order to support massive repositories, not allrepository data is downloaded to the client system when checking out arepository. Clients ideally only download the minimal amount of datanecessary, and then fetch additional data from the server as it is needed.\n   Mononoke currently builds and runs only on Linux, and is not yet buildableoutside of Facebook&#39;s internal environment. Work is still in progress tosupport building Mononoke with Rust&#39;s  cargo build system.\n   EdenFS speeds up operations in large repositories by only populating workingdirectory files on demand, as they are accessed. This makes operations like checkout much faster, in exchange for a small performance hit when firstaccessing new files. This is quite beneficial in large repositories wheredevelopers often only work with a small subset of the repository at a time.\n EdenFS has similar performance advantages to using sparse checkouts, but a muchbetter user experience. Unlike with sparse checkouts, EdenFS does not requiremanually curating the list of files to check out, and users can transparentlyaccess any file without needing to update the profile.\n EdenFS also keeps track of which files have been modified, allowing veryefficient  status queries that do not need to scan the working directory.The filesystem monitoring tool  Watchmanalso integrates with EdenFS, allowing it to more efficiently track updates tothe filesystem.\n   The recommended way to build EdenFS is using the  build.sh script in thetop-level of the repository.

California, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania are  sending buses equipped with long-distance routers to poor and rural neighborhoods.\n One Texas school district keeps its buses in park from 8am to 2pm every weekday. The WiFi connection has a 200-ft reach, and families who lack stable internet access at home pull over in their cars to use it.\n  About 27% of Americans don\u2019t have home broadband access,  according to Pew. But now that home internet has become a requirement for many students and white-collar workers, local governments and companies are patching together emergency fixes:\n Libraries and government offices have adjusted or upgraded their routers to target the outdoors, making  parking lots a hub of connectivity.\n   The nonprofit Information Technology Disaster Resource Center is bankrolling WiFi installation projects in  rural churches and other key areas.\n In Peru, Facebook is  testing an app that turns websites into low-lift text pages and offering free internet data for people to use it.\n  These are temporary salves, and they don\u2019t roll back the underlying problem: Home broadband is  more expensive in rural areas than in cities, yet it tends to perform worse.\n Some localities are serving up solutions that will let them stream  that Beyonc\u00e9/Megan Thee Stallion remix even after the pandemic subsides. Western Colorado, for instance, recently put the finishing touches on a  DIY broadband network.\n Other advocates are  pushing for something even bigger: A modern version of the Rural Electrification Act, this time focused on universal internet connectivity.\n The timing seems to fit. The REA was signed in 1936 \u2014 soon after, you know, that other great depression.\n    School districts are bringing WiFi connections to communities that need them now more than ever. ...\n Read

"note_en": "Almost a year ago, I wrote a  story about MacKenzie Bezos. The novelist had recently  divorced Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and announced she planned to give away the majority of her fortune, estimated at the time to be worth more than $36 billion. I argued that while it was an admirable move on MacKenzie\u2019s part, relying on the generosity of the rich wouldn\u2019t solve society\u2019s problems.\n Around that time is when the messages started to arrive: In hundreds of emails, calls, and texts, people showered me with flattering platitudes and marriage proposals, shared startup ideas, and told rambling personal stories. Most of the time, though, they asked for money. I didn\u2019t understand what was happening, at least not at first. As a reporter, I don\u2019t usually field emails requesting, as one self-described 30-year-old in Korea did, that I buy them a Porsche.\n I slowly realized that I wasn\u2019t being spammed, at least not in the traditional sense. Instead, I was being mistaken for MacKenzie Bezos herself. How did hundreds of people wind up reaching a random woman in Brooklyn instead of a powerful billionaire? The answer turned out to be the result of an even more powerful tech company: Google.\n  When WIRED published that story about MacKenzie, embedded in the article page was my email address and a phone number. It was intended for readers to share feedback or send tips\u2014a common practice among journalists and writers. Since MacKenzie\u2019s name was in the article, Google began pulling the paragraph with my information as though it was hers. If you searched for \u201cMacKenzie Bezos phone number,\u201d \u201cMacKenzie Bezos contact,\u201d or something similar on Google, my email address and phone number were likely to show up at the top of the results, prominently displayed in a standalone box the company calls a \u201cfeatured snippet.\u201d\n   Not everyone who contacted me fully believed I was MacKenzie\u2014\u201cSure this is a scam email,\u201d one person wrote in a message earlier this month\u2014but enough people seemed to. I\u2019ve received countless messages since last May, some describing heartbreaking situations, others nearly indecipherable. These days, they\u2019ve taken a semi-apocalyptic turn as a result of the pandemic. A person from the UK recently requested funds to build an underground bunker for their family and friends. \u201cI should tell you more about myself. I don\u2019t make a habit of asking people for \u00a32 million, but this virus has taught me that I need to be ready for the big one,\u201d they wrote.\n  I reached out to Google\u2019s press email three times to try to get my problem fixed, starting in November of last year. In February, feeling desperate, I asked if there was anything WIRED could do to make it stop. \u201cOnce again I\u2019m experiencing this problem with Mackenzie Bezos, I\u2019ve received probably 100 emails in the last few weeks from Google users who think I am her or work with her,\u201d I wrote. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything WIRED can do, please let me know.\u201d I finally heard back from Google this week, after I said I planned to write about my experience.\n  \u201cIn situations where people are searching for something like a phone number that is not readily available online, our systems are understanding these pages (that include those exact keywords plus a phone number) to be the best matches available, even if the phone number is not the correct number for that entity,\u201d Lara Levin, a spokesperson for Google, said in an email. Levin added that the company plans to look at ways it could improve its system \u201cto better recognize\u201d when a phone number should not be resurfaced as a featured snippet.\n Until that happens, the only recourse is for WIRED to reconfigure its website to prevent Google from scraping my contact information. I could, of course, take down my email address and phone number altogether, but I want people to know how to reach me in order to do my job. I\u2019m fine with strangers reaching out to me\u2014I just don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m a billionaire philanthropist.\n  Is there something you think we should know? You can reach the writer, who is not a billionaire, at  louise_matsakis@wired.com or by phone at 347-966-3806.\n Google\u2019s stated mission has always been to \u201corganize the world\u2019s information.\u201d For a long time, it mainly did that by ranking search results. Type a question or keyword into Google\u2019s search bar, and it would return a list of websites its algorithms decided had the best chance of containing an answer to your question. You were expected to click through to find what you wanted\u2014Google was a portal, not a destination. Eight years ago, the company  fundamentally changed that arrangement when it introduced its \u201cKnowledge Graph.\u201d\n Now, Google often tries to answer your query directly, by pulling information from sites like Wikipedia into boxes it calls \u201cfeatured snippets\u201d or \u201cknowledge panels,\u201d which appear above or alongside traditional search results. If you look up a celebrity\u2019s net worth, for example, Google may  scrape the information from somewhere like CelebrityNetWorth.com. Especially on mobile devices, the widgets are convenient for users in search of quick answers, sidestepping the need to dig through information published by multiple sources.\n Google featured snippets and knowledge panels are  controlled by algorithms, and largely not pre-screened for accuracy. That means the knowledge Google scrapes from the rest of the internet is not always correct. Plenty of errors, some more consequential than others, have made it onto Google this way. In one case, a knowledge panel incorrectly stated entrepreneur and basketball dad LaVar Ball  founded the NBA. In a particularly  embarrassing instance from 2018, Google\u2019s knowledge panel for the California Republican Party listed \u201cNazism\u201d among its ideologies. The company attributed the mishap to Wikipedia vandalism that then got pulled into Google, but it still angered Republican lawmakers already concerned the tech giant was  biased against conservatives.\n As I learned firsthand, people can spend months trying to rectify false information contained in them. In one instance reported by   The Wall Street Journal last year, Google incorrectly stated the actor Paul Campbell had passed away, causing his mother to panic. Levin, the Google spokesperson, says that the company encourages people to provide it with feedback, and will \u201ctake action on these features in accordance with our policies.\u201d Google\u2019s  policies on featured snippets don\u2019t ban false information explicitly, although the company does say that \u201cpublic interest content\u2014including civic, medical, scientific and historical issues\u2014should not contradict well-established or expert consensus support.\u201d\n  This isn\u2019t even the first time my contact information has been listed by Google as a way to reach someone else. In March of last year, Google started associating my number and email address with TikTok customer support, after I published a simple guide to  using the app. I received dozens of messages from people locked out of their accounts or struggling with other issues. A  group of girls from Norway asked me why their videos weren\u2019t going viral like the ones from their American peers. I only understood what was happening after I started texting a teenager whose TikTok account had been hacked by her bully. She called me repeatedly one night, and later patiently explained that she had found my number on Google. At the time, there didn\u2019t appear to be a straightforward way to contact TikTok through its website, which likely didn\u2019t help my case.\n As MacKenzie Bezos\u2019 Google doppelg\u00e4nger, I\u2019ve heard from people who say they\u2019re in Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Pennsylvania, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, England, Namibia, India, Kenya, New York, Ghana, Alabama, and many more places. It\u2019s unlikely I would have heard from any of them if not for Google, one of the most influential sources of information across the world.\n  The tech giant\u2019s power might be why my contact information was associated with MacKenzie Bezos in the first place: Like many publications, WIRED gets a significant portion of its web traffic through search engines. To make that happen, our website is optimized to rank as highly in search results as possible. In fact, I\u2019m not the only journalist to experience this same problem; Google  associated Motherboard reporter Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai\u2019s phone number with Facebook customer support last year. Both of our mixups were the combined result of Google trying to give people the answers they want, and media organizations working to ensure their work is seen by as many eyeballs as possible.\n I continue to hear from people in search of MacKenzie Bezos almost every day. While I was finishing up this story, my phone rang. A number from Bangladesh was calling, my daily reminder that somewhere out there, I\u2019m still being mistaken for a billionaire.\n   \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Want the best tools to get healthy?

"note_en": "We need to protect the public transport network as lockdown is lifted, the UK&#39;s transport secretary is expected to say at a press conference on Saturday.\n The BBC understands Grant Shapps will encourage the public to continue to work from home if they can.\n Those who need to travel to work will be urged to consider more active ways to travel like walking and cycling.\n Extra funding is likely to be announced for English local authorities to help alter road networks to facilitate this.\n   Matters concerning cycling and walking are devolved. For example, Wales has had legislation in place to boost both activities since 2013, while Scotland announced funding  for &#34;active travel infrastructure&#34; in April.\n It is believed that Mr Shapps will talk about using the unique &#34;opportunity&#34; of the lockdown restrictions to change the way we get to work.\n  How we will travel while maintaining social distancing is one of the biggest challenges the government faces as it seeks to start to lift the lockdown.\n Maintaining the two-metre rule will mean buses, trains and tubes will be able to carry far fewer passengers.\n  There have been fewer buses and trains scheduled during the lockdown, so it will take time to restore normal services.\n Many commuters will also be concerned about the safety of crowded buses and trains but, if more people try to commute into work in their cars, the roads are likely to become choked with traffic.\n  The solution, Grant Shapps is expected to say, is for us all to walk and cycle more.\n The BBC understands that the proposal to increase what the government is calling &#34;active travel&#34; will be presented as an opportunity for us all to live &#34;cleaner, greener, healthier lives&#34;.\n Mr Shapps is likely to announce extra funding for local authorities to pay for alterations to the road network to facilitate this move to more active ways to get around.\n He is also expected to announce plans to give local authorities new powers to change the road network and designate extra space for cyclists and pedestrians.\n The mayors of London and Manchester - Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham - announced last week that they were planning to close some roads to cars to create dedicated pedestrian and cycle routes.\n BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said Mr Shapps was also set to announce that trials of e-scooters will be fast-tracked to any area of Britain that wanted to attempt one.\n  The transport secretary&#39;s announcement comes as a coalition of nine environmental and transport pressure groups have written to the government to demand a big increase in spending on walking and cycling.\n Their letter calls for a fundamental redesign of the transport network to improve public health, clean the air and protect the climate.\n It also points out that the lockdown has led to a dramatic improvement in air quality in Britain&#39;s towns and cities.\n Some of Britain&#39;s largest cities  have seen a 60% reduction in levels of nitrogen dioxide, a harmful pollutant gas associated with traffic.\n The letter&#39;s signatories include Greenpeace, the countryside charity the CPRE (Campaign to Protect Rural England), and seven other environment and transport organisations.\n They argue that making a permanent switch towards more active travel would help protect these improvements in the local environment.\n    Toxic air is responsible for thousands of premature deaths in the UK every year, the letter says.\n &#34;It would be completely absurd if, after the unprecedented efforts and sacrifices made to save thousands of lives from Covid-19, we allowed thousands more to be cut short by the devastating impacts of toxic pollution,&#34; it reads.\n The organisations recommend that local authorities widen pavements and increase cycle lanes, as well as giving priority to people who walk and cycle.\n They call for the speed limit to be cut to 20 mph in all built-up areas except where segregated cycle lanes are in place. They also demand \u00a36bn in additional funding over the next five years to invest in new transport infrastructure.", "posttime": "2020-05-09 20:34:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "For centuries western culture has been permeated by the idea that humans are selfish creatures. That cynical image of humanity has been proclaimed in films and novels, history books and scientific research. But in the last 20 years, something extraordinary has happened. Scientists from all over the world have switched to a more hopeful view of mankind. This development is still so young that researchers in different fields often don\u2019t even know about each other.\n When I started writing a book about this more hopeful view, I knew there was one story I would have to address. It takes place on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific. A plane has just gone down. The only survivors are some British schoolboys, who can\u2019t believe their good fortune. Nothing but beach, shells and water for miles. And better yet: no grownups.\n On the very first day, the boys institute a democracy of sorts. One boy, Ralph, is elected to be the group\u2019s leader. Athletic, charismatic and handsome, his game plan is simple: 1) Have fun. 2) Survive. 3) Make smoke signals for passing ships. Number one is a success. The others? Not so much. The boys are more interested in feasting and frolicking than in tending the fire. Before long, they have begun painting their faces. Casting off their clothes. And they develop overpowering urges \u2013 to pinch, to kick, to bite.\n By the time a British naval officer comes ashore, the island is a smouldering wasteland. Three of the children are dead. \u201cI should have thought,\u201d the officer says, \u201cthat a pack of British boys would have been able to put up a better show than that.\u201d At this, Ralph bursts into tears. \u201cRalph wept for the end of innocence,\u201d we read, and for \u201cthe darkness of man\u2019s heart\u201d.\n  This story never happened. An English schoolmaster,  William Golding, made up this story in 1951 \u2013 his novel  Lord of the Flies would sell tens of millions of copies, be translated into more than 30 languages and hailed as one of the classics of the 20th century. In hindsight, the secret to the book\u2019s success is clear. Golding had a masterful ability to portray the darkest depths of mankind. Of course, he had the zeitgeist of the 1960s on his side, when a new generation was questioning its parents about the atrocities of the second world war. Had Auschwitz been an anomaly, they wanted to know, or is there a Nazi hiding in each of us?\n I first read  Lord of the Flies as a teenager. I remember feeling disillusioned afterwards, but not for a second did I think to doubt Golding\u2019s view of human nature. That didn\u2019t happen until years later when I began delving into the author\u2019s life. I learned what an unhappy individual he had been: an alcoholic, prone to depression; a man who beat his kids. \u201cI have always understood the Nazis,\u201d Golding confessed, \u201cbecause I am of that sort by nature.\u201d And it was \u201cpartly out of that sad self-knowledge\u201d that he wrote  Lord of the Flies.\n I began to wonder: had anyone ever studied what real children would do if they found themselves alone on a deserted island? I wrote an article on the subject, in which I compared  Lord of the Flies to modern scientific insights and concluded that, in all probability, kids would act very differently. Readers responded sceptically. All my examples concerned kids at home, at school, or at summer camp. Thus began my quest for a real-life  Lord of the Flies. After trawling the web for a while, I came across an obscure blog that told an arresting story: \u201cOne day, in 1977, six boys set out from Tonga on a fishing trip ... Caught in a huge storm, the boys were shipwrecked on a deserted island. What do they do, this little tribe? They made a pact never to quarrel.\u201d\n  The article did not provide any sources. But sometimes all it takes is a stroke of luck. Sifting through a newspaper archive one day, I typed a year incorrectly and there it was. The reference to 1977 turned out to have been a typo. In the 6 October 1966 edition of Australian newspaper The Age, a headline jumped out at me: \u201cSunday showing for Tongan castaways\u201d. The story concerned six boys who had been found three weeks earlier on a rocky islet south of Tonga, an island group in the Pacific Ocean. The boys had been rescued by an Australian sea captain after being marooned on the island of \u2018Ata for more than a year. According to the article, the captain had even got a television station to film a re-enactment of the boys\u2019 adventure.\n I was bursting with questions. Were the boys still alive? And could I find the television footage? Most importantly, though, I had a lead: the captain\u2019s name was Peter Warner. When I searched for him, I had another stroke of luck. In a recent issue of a tiny local paper from Mackay, Australia, I came across the headline: \u201cMates share 50-year bond\u201d. Printed alongside was a small photograph of two men, smiling, one with his arm slung around the other. The article began: \u201cDeep in a banana plantation at Tullera, near Lismore, sit an unlikely pair of mates ... The elder is 83 years old, the son of a wealthy industrialist. The younger, 67, was, literally, a child of nature.\u201d Their names? Peter Warner and Mano Totau. And where had they met? On a deserted island.\n My wife Maartje and I rented a car in Brisbane and some three hours later arrived at our destination, a spot in the middle of nowhere that stumped Google Maps. Yet there he was, sitting out in front of a low-slung house off the dirt road: the man who rescued six lost boys 50 years ago, Captain Peter Warner.\n  Peter was the youngest son of Arthur Warner, once one of the richest and most powerful men in Australia. Back in the 1930s, Arthur ruled over a vast empire called Electronic Industries, which dominated the country\u2019s radio market at the time. Peter was groomed to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. Instead, at the age of 17, he ran away to sea in search of adventure and spent the next few years sailing from Hong Kong to Stockholm, Shanghai to St Petersburg. When he finally returned five years later, the prodigal son proudly presented his father with a Swedish captain\u2019s certificate. Unimpressed, Warner Sr demanded his son learn a useful profession. \u201cWhat\u2019s easiest?\u201d Peter asked. \u201cAccountancy,\u201d Arthur lied.\n Peter went to work for his father\u2019s company, yet the sea still beckoned, and whenever he could he went to Tasmania, where he kept his own fishing fleet. It was this that brought him to Tonga in the winter of 1966. On the way home he took a little detour and that\u2019s when he saw it: a minuscule island in the azure sea, \u2018Ata. The island had been inhabited once, until one dark day in 1863, when a slave ship appeared on the horizon and sailed off with the natives. Since then, \u2018Ata had been deserted \u2013 cursed and forgotten.\n  But Peter noticed something odd. Peering through his binoculars, he saw burned patches on the green cliffs. \u201cIn the tropics it\u2019s unusual for fires to start spontaneously,\u201d he told us, a half century later. Then he saw a boy. Naked. Hair down to his shoulders. This wild creature leaped from the cliffside and plunged into the water. Suddenly more boys followed, screaming at the top of their lungs. It didn\u2019t take long for the first boy to reach the boat. \u201cMy name is Stephen,\u201d he cried in perfect English. \u201cThere are six of us and we reckon we\u2019ve been here 15 months.\u201d\n The boys, once aboard, claimed they were students at a boarding school in Nuku\u2018alofa, the Tongan capital. Sick of school meals, they had decided to take a fishing boat out one day, only to get caught in a storm. Likely story, Peter thought. Using his two-way radio, he called in to Nuku\u2018alofa. \u201cI\u2019ve got six kids here,\u201d he told the operator. \u201cStand by,\u201d came the response. Twenty minutes ticked by. (As Peter tells this part of the story, he gets a little misty-eyed.) Finally, a very tearful operator came on the radio, and said: \u201cYou found them! These boys have been given up for dead. Funerals have been held. If it\u2019s them, this is a miracle!\u201d\n In the months that followed I tried to reconstruct as precisely as possible what had happened on \u2018Ata. Peter\u2019s memory turned out to be excellent. Even at the age of 90, everything he recounted was consistent with my foremost other source, Mano, 15 years old at the time and now pushing 70, who lived just a few hours\u2019 drive from him. The real  Lord of the Flies, Mano told us, began in June 1965. The protagonists were six boys \u2013 Sione, Stephen, Kolo, David, Luke and Mano \u2013 all pupils at a strict Catholic boarding school in Nuku\u2018alofa. The oldest was 16, the youngest 13, and they had one main thing in common: they were bored witless. So they came up with a plan to escape: to Fiji, some 500 miles away, or even all the way to New Zealand.\n There was only one obstacle. None of them owned a boat, so they decided to \u201cborrow\u201d one from Mr Taniela Uhila, a fisherman they all disliked. The boys took little time to prepare for the voyage. Two sacks of bananas, a few coconuts and a small gas burner were all the supplies they packed. It didn\u2019t occur to any of them to bring a map, let alone a compass.\n  No one noticed the small craft leaving the harbour that evening. Skies were fair; only a mild breeze ruffled the calm sea. But that night the boys made a grave error. They fell asleep. A few hours later they awoke to water crashing down over their heads. It was dark. They hoisted the sail, which the wind promptly tore to shreds. Next to break was the rudder. \u201cWe drifted for eight days,\u201d Mano told me. \u201cWithout food. Without water.\u201d The boys tried catching fish. They managed to collect some rainwater in hollowed-out coconut shells and shared it equally between them, each taking a sip in the morning and another in the evening.\n Then, on the eighth day, they spied a miracle on the horizon. A small island, to be precise. Not a tropical paradise with waving palm trees and sandy beaches, but a hulking mass of rock, jutting up more than a thousand feet out of the ocean. These days, \u2018Ata is considered uninhabitable. But \u201cby the time we arrived,\u201d Captain Warner wrote in his memoirs, \u201cthe boys had set up a small commune with food garden, hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater, a gymnasium with curious weights, a badminton court, chicken pens and a permanent fire, all from handiwork, an old knife blade and much determination.\u201d While the boys in  Lord of the Flies come to blows over the fire, those in this real-life version tended their flame so it never went out, for more than a year.\n  The kids agreed to work in teams of two, drawing up a strict roster for garden, kitchen and guard duty. Sometimes they quarrelled, but whenever that happened they solved it by imposing a time-out. Their days began and ended with song and prayer. Kolo fashioned a makeshift guitar from a piece of driftwood, half a coconut shell and six steel wires salvaged from their wrecked boat \u2013 an instrument Peter has kept all these years \u2013 and played it to help lift their spirits. And their spirits needed lifting. All summer long it hardly rained, driving the boys frantic with thirst. They tried constructing a raft in order to leave the island, but it fell apart in the crashing surf.\n Worst of all, Stephen slipped one day, fell off a cliff and broke his leg. The other boys picked their way down after him and then helped him back up to the top. They set his leg using sticks and leaves. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Sione joked. \u201cWe\u2019ll do your work, while you lie there like King Taufa\u2018ahau Tupou himself!\u201d\n They survived initially on fish, coconuts, tame birds (they drank the blood as well as eating the meat); seabird eggs were sucked dry. Later, when they got to the top of the island, they found an ancient volcanic crater, where people had lived a century before. There the boys discovered wild taro, bananas and chickens (which had been reproducing for the 100 years since the last Tongans had left).\n  They were finally rescued on Sunday 11 September 1966. The local physician later expressed astonishment at their muscled physiques and Stephen\u2019s perfectly healed leg. But this wasn\u2019t the end of the boys\u2019 little adventure, because, when they arrived back in Nuku\u2018alofa police boarded Peter\u2019s boat, arrested the boys and threw them in jail. Mr Taniela Uhila, whose sailing boat the boys had \u201cborrowed\u201d 15 months earlier, was still furious, and he\u2019d decided to press charges.\n Fortunately for the boys, Peter came up with a plan. It occurred to him that the story of their shipwreck was perfect Hollywood material. And being his father\u2019s corporate accountant, Peter managed the company\u2019s film rights and knew people in TV. So from Tonga, he called up the manager of Channel 7 in Sydney. \u201cYou can have the Australian rights,\u201d he told them. \u201cGive me the world rights.\u201d Next, Peter paid Mr Uhila \u00a3150 for his old boat, and got the boys released on condition that they would cooperate with the movie. A few days later, a team from Channel 7 arrived.\n The mood when the boys returned to their families in Tonga was jubilant. Almost the entire island of Ha\u02bbafeva \u2013 population 900 \u2013 had turned out to welcome them home. Peter was proclaimed a national hero. Soon he received a message from King Taufa\u2018ahau Tupou IV himself, inviting the captain for an audience. \u201cThank you for rescuing six of my subjects,\u201d His Royal Highness said. \u201cNow, is there anything I can do for you?\u201d The captain didn\u2019t have to think long. \u201cYes! I would like to trap lobster in these waters and start a business here.\u201d The king consented. Peter returned to Sydney, resigned from his father\u2019s company and commissioned a new ship. Then he had the six boys brought over and granted them the thing that had started it all: an opportunity to see the world beyond Tonga. He hired them as the crew of his new fishing boat.\n While the boys of \u2018Ata have been consigned to obscurity, Golding\u2019s book is still widely read. Media historians even credit him as being the unwitting originator of one of the most popular entertainment genres on television today: reality TV. \u201cI read and reread  Lord of the Flies ,\u201d divulged the creator of hit series  Survivor in an interview.\n It\u2019s time we told a different kind of story. The real  Lord of the Flies is a tale of friendship and loyalty; one that illustrates how much stronger we are if we can lean on each other. After my wife took Peter\u2019s picture, he turned to a cabinet and rummaged around for a bit, then drew out a heavy stack of papers that he laid in my hands. His memoirs, he explained, written for his children and grandchildren. I looked down at the first page. \u201cLife has taught me a great deal,\u201d it began, \u201cincluding the lesson that you should always look for what is good and positive in people.\u201d\n \u2022  This is an adapted excerpt from Rutger Bregman\u2019s Humankind, translated by Elizabeth Manton and Erica Moore.

"note_en": "A year ago Bitsy  released on itch.io \u2013 a humble game making tool described by its creator as a \u201clittle editor for little games or worlds\u201d. Since its release, more than 600 games have been made using the tool by 300 different authors.\n On the surface Bitsy is an unassuming engine. It lets you create small pixel-art rooms that players can explore by interacting with the people and objects within them. Its simplicity hides a surprising depth, one that has drawn in a community of game makers.\u201cBitsy came from my own frustrations with trying to finish a game,\u201d says Adam Le Doux, Bitsy\u2019s creator. \u201cNaturally, the solution was to build a new game engine from scratch! I wanted to stop worrying about programming details, screen resolutions, platform differences, post-processing effects. I wanted to be able to immediately work on the heart of what I was trying to create: a world with a story.\u201d\n He was inspired by his favourite spaces in games \u2013 towns in 2D RPGs like Zelda, Pokemon and Final Fantasy, and walking simulators like Gone Home. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved walking around and talking to everyone to learn about their personal problems or the history of the town. Games like that gave me confidence that those ingredients \u2013 a place and its inhabitants \u2013 were enough to make something interesting.\u201d\n  He created Bitsy as a simple engine that doesn\u2019t require coding knowledge to create something within it. It\u2019s an engine built on constraint, restricting you to 8\u00d78 pixel tiles and a three colour palette.\n \u201cI made my first game about coming home to my apartment after work and finding my wife, Mary-Margaret, already napping on the couch and our cat begging for a snack,\u201d says Adam. It used an early version of Bitsy, which required everything to be typed into a text file that was then loaded into the engine.\n Adam created the web app version of the editor when Mary-Margaret and a few friends said they wanted to make their own games using it. He put it online, posted it on Twitter and figured that would be the end of it.\n  Bitsy took off. Game makers found that the editor\u2019s simplicity meant that they could make compelling games over a couple of evenings. The lowered stakes meant it was perfect for testing out ideas, making short mood pieces or expressing personal stories.\n Claire Morley was one of these designers. She was drawn in by Bitsy\u2019s distinctive art style, created as a byproduct of the engines constraints.\n  \u201cI played a few other games from the  Bitsy Moth Jam,\u201d she says. \u201cI loved how they all felt really similar, yet so distinct from each other. They all felt mysterious, but personal. They almost feel like they\u2019re all from an alien or ancient culture, connected together, and by playing them I was scratching the surface of something magical.\u201d\n Claire decided she wanted to make her own game. She made  Cat\u2019s Out of the Bag! for the next jam, a game about sneaking around a highschool and listening to people\u2019s conversations. She\u2019s since made a handful of Bitsy games featuring  train journeys,  snowblindness and  a message in a bottle.\n \u201cBitsy strips away anything that\u2019s not completely necessary to making an interactive story. It\u2019s a very focused and limited tool, but those limitations mean you don\u2019t have all this noise about what art style to use or how to set up controls,\u201d says Claire. \u201cWhile those are important things, the absence of them means that it\u2019s easier to get to the core of the story, experience or message you\u2019re trying to convey. It\u2019s why Bitsy games often feel so conceptually strong.\u201d\n Bitsy games feel like they belong to a distinct form of game making, one with its own rules and visual language. Making a game in Bitsy feels equivalent to deciding to record a film using Super 8 or shooting photos with an analogue camera. While it\u2019s easy to learn for beginners, there\u2019s still lots of space for experienced creators to experiment with. It\u2019s led to people doing things with Bitsy that even Adam hadn\u2019t anticipated.\n \u201cPeople keep pushing against the constraints to invent new ways to use Bitsy that I never intended,\u201d says Adam. People have made  short films, procedurally generated  radio tuners and  astronomy simulators using Bitsy. Much of this inventiveness has been driven by the community that has formed around the tool.\n  \u201cIf development of Bitsy itself froze today, I think we could still spend years finding interesting ways to use it,\u201d says game and tool maker Mark Wonnacott, who is passionate about the community that has formed around the engine.\n \u201cPeople are actually using it and playing each others games,\u201d they explain. \u201cThere\u2019s a good community of people helping and encouraging each other. People have drawn parallels between Bitsy and Twine, but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re thinking about the tool as much as the shape of the scene forming round it.\u201d\n Both Claire and Mark are at the heart of that scene. Claire has been pivotal in creating spaces for the community to flourish. Alongside Lorenzo Pilia (programme manager for  A Maze and part of the Global Game Jam executive committee) she set up @bitsypcs, a Twitter account that shares news about Bitsy and games made in the engine.\n The Twitter account led to the pair setting up a Discord, Bitsy Talk, which has become an unofficial home of the community. It\u2019s a welcoming space where people can go and \u201cshare ideas, games and add-on tools\u201d. There you can find people who\u2019ve made half a dozen games giving tips to complete beginners.\n  Mark has become something of a Bitsy archivist. They created the  Bitsy Omnibus, a catalogue of every Bitsy game. It was originally motivated by another of their projects, the Bitsy Boutique, a hardware player for Bitsy games made using a PocketCHIP mounted in a jewellery box.\n  \u201cI wanted to work out how to elevate Bitsy games from individual web games into something you could exhibit somewhere,\u201d explains Mark, \u201cTo get it in front of people who aren\u2019t playing tiny webgames already. The response from creators has been unanimously positive so far, people are excited to see their works recognised as part of a larger whole.\u201d\n Its first showing has just been announced for Rezzed\u2019s  Leftfield Collection. It\u2019s one of the ways Bitsy is starting to move beyond online spaces. There are meetups in Brighton and Seattle, and Claire and Mark are working together to host one in Bristol. Claire is also hosting a workshop to teach kids to make games using Bitsy (she\u2019s previously taught her  Dad).\n  \u201cSeeing the community take shape has been the most magical and inspiring thing about working on Bitsy.\u201d says Adam, \u201cWithout their creativity and hard work, we wouldn\u2019t be talking about Bitsy right now. All the ways they use the engine has driven what I\u2019ve added to it, and given me the energy to keep working on the project.\u201d\n This energy goes both ways. The community sprung from Adam\u2019s willingness to listen to thoughts, questions and feedback. He\u2019s also the host of a monthly game jam that has inspired many to make their first game. The community hasn\u2019t sprung up from nowhere: Adam\u2019s recognition of its importance and his willingness to nurture it is a reason for its growth.\n \u201cThe community is crucial for people who are maybe making a game or sharing one to a wider audience for the first time,\u201d says Adam. \u201cIt helps people to see that it\u2019s accepted and celebrated to make something small, or personal, or incomplete.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-09 20:18:19", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,\u5236\u9020\u5546,game,bitsy",

"note_en": "\u201cJapanese researchers are closing in on understanding why electrical storms have a positive influence on the growth of some fungi,\u201d   Physics World reported last month, with some interesting implications for agriculture.\n These electrical storms do not have to be nearby, and they do not even need to be natural: \u201cIn a series of experiments, Koichi Takaki at Iwate University and colleagues showed that artificial lightning strikes do not have to directly strike shiitake mushroom cultivation beds to promote growth.\u201d Instead, it seems one can coax mushrooms into fruiting using even just the indirect presence of electrical fields.\n As the article explains, \u201catmospheric electricity has long been known to boost the growth of living things, including plants, insects and rats,\u201d but mushrooms appear to respond even to regional electrical phenomena\u2014for example, when a distant lightning storm rolls by. \u201cIn Takaki\u2019s previous studies, yield increases were achieved by running a direct current through a shiitake mushroom log. But Takaki still wondered\u2014why do natural electric storms indirectly influenced [sic] the growth of mushrooms located miles away from the lightning strikes?\u201d\n Whether or not power lines or electricity-generation facilities, such as power plants, might also affect\u2014or even catalyze\u2014mushroom growth is not clear.\n For now, Takaki is hoping to develop some kind of electrical-stimulation technique for mushroom growth, with an eye on the global food market.\n  It is quite astonishing to imagine that, someday, those mushrooms you\u2019re eating in a gourmet pasta dish were grown inside some sort of wild, Nikola Tesla-like electrical cage, half  X-Men, half food-technology of the near-future\u2014underground shining domes of fungal power.\n  The opening image of this post, meanwhile, is from a surreal field trip I took back in 2009 with Nicola Twilley to visit the \u201c mushroom tunnel of Mittagong,\u201d a disused rail tunnel in southeast Australia that is\u2014or, as of 2009, was\u2014used as a subterranean mushroom-growth facility. Imagine this tunnel quietly pulsing with electricity in the darkness, humid, strobing, its wet logs fruiting with directed fungi.\n Electrical mushroom-control techniques, or where the future of food production merges imperceptibly with the world of H.P.

"note_en": "This article is part of my  Confessions of an Unintentional CTO book, which is currently available to read for free online.\n We web application owners often want to accept credit card payments for whatever we sell. Because rolling our own  security-compliant merchant solutions is both risky and time-consuming, we usually offload the hassle to payment providers like PayPal or Stripe.\n At first glance, the fee schedule for these services seems reasonable enough, but sadly, there\u2019s a lot of small print and there are plenty of hidden gotchas that are costly yet difficult to detect up front. To give but one example: When I wrote the first draft of this post way back in December 2015, the homepage of PayPal advertised that \u201cin most cases\u201d they charge a 1.9% transaction fee for their services. Sounds OK-ish, right? In reality, my average fee that month was a whopping 8.8%\u2014four times more than I was led to expect. So where do all these extra charges enter the picture?\n  Part of the beauty of the web is that it connects people, despite traditional national borders; there\u2019s nothing stopping customers from Australia or Brazil or Qatar from stopping by your website and buying something. Of course, even though the web transcends national borders, it nevertheless exists in a bordered world. As such, your international customers will want to buy using their own currency, which will probably differ from the one predominant in your homeland.\n Web application owners have two choices here: bill in the customer\u2019s currency or bill in their own currency.\n For the purposes of illustration, I\u2019ll assume from here that your business operates in EUR and your customer wants to buy with GBP.\n  The customer will have to pay a currency conversion fee, and this will be levied either by their credit card provider (Visa etc.) or the payment provider you integrated into your website (PayPal et al). Although you personally avoid currency conversion fees in this case, this approach is nevertheless commercially untenable for most businesses. Aside from tarnishing your reputation by exposing the customer to extra hidden fees, this approach has an even more immediate downside: it scares and confuses customers who, upon seeing your website pricing and billing in EUR instead of their home GBP, now feel your products are somehow foreign, inappropriate, or even inferior to those sold by competitors billing in their local currency. This in turn chips away at your conversion rates.\n  The consequence here is that your payment provider account will accumulate GBP holdings. But because your business needs EUR to pay its bills, sooner or later you\u2019ll have to convert the GBP into EUR. Here\u2019s where payment providers fleece you: there is often a small print stipulation that you are not allowed to withdraw money to your bank account without first converting money to your home currency (EUR)  through their platform. The catch is that their currency conversion rate\u2014the one you are forced to accept\u2014is between 2.5% and 4.5% higher than the normal market rates available at that time. The payment providers will tell you that this surcharge exists to cover them in case of \u201cmarket fluctuations\u201d. This is utter rubbish and represents an almost criminal misrepresentation of the magnitude of the risk. By way of comparison, normal banks\u2014such as Deutsche Bank\u2014are subject to this exact same risk, but they charge only 0.1% above the market rate. Go figure.\n In the cases of  some payment providers transacting with certain narrow combinations of currencies, there is respite and you can sometimes withdraw money without forced currency exchanges. For example, with Stripe in Germany, you are allowed to withdraw GBP to a GBP-denominated bank account based in Germany, thereby avoiding the forced currency conversion fee that would otherwise apply when withdrawing to a EUR bank account. That said, even Stripe doesn\u2019t offer the same possibility for many other countries and currencies. And, needless to say, the good people at PayPal  always force you to withdraw in EUR if you are based in a EUR country, meaning you can never avoid their obscene currency conversion fees. The only way around their system is to open up a bank account in the UK, then open up a separate PayPal account there for your GBP transactions, and then finally build a software merry-go-round to switch PayPal accounts depending on your customer\u2019s currency.\n All in all, the accounting and administrative hassle involved with circumnavigating a payment provider\u2019s currency conversion fees may not be worth it for many small businesses, and as such, they are forced to grin and bear the inflated fees.\n  The rosy picture painted on payment providers\u2019 home pages also quotes you a rate for  domestic transactions, that is, for customers based in the same country as you. Given that the internet is a global community, it could well be the case that more than 90% of your customers are international. If so, you\u2019ll be charged up to an additional 3% in fees. This is  in addition to the fees for currency conversion, meaning that the total of extra fees for international customers can amount to up to 7.5%.\n  Some payment providers, like PayPal, allow your past customers to file disputes with them directly. All too often, this is a vehicle for fraud. For example, imagine that a rogue places an order on your website, receives whatever electronic service you provide, then files a (dishonest) complaint with the payment provider, claiming that their card was stolen or that the goods didn\u2019t match the description. Meanwhile, this rogue continues to download your digital products or enjoy your service. PayPal claims to look at both sides of the case yet invariably it decides any dispute in favour of the customer, without considering any evidence you have, meaning you automatically lose a percentage of your sales thanks to easily prevented fraud. This is, in effect, an insidious hidden charge they place on your business, and one they use to bolster their reputation at your expense.", "posttime": "2020-05-09 18:00:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546,providers,\u8d27\u5e01", "title": "\u652f\u4ed8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u6b3a\u8d1f\u4f60(2015)", "title_en": "Payments Providers Screw You (2015)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/how-payments-providers-screw-you", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546", "providers", "\u8d27\u5e01"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5455dc5fac65f12010e709314226de7c.jpg", "infoid": 1001374, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u89c6\u98911701\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u673a\u5668\u6253\u5f00\u56fd\u4f1a\u5927\u53a6\u7684\u78c1\u9501\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u5b83\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\uff01\u83b7\u80dc\u8005\u4e0d\u60f3\u652f\u4ed8\u8fd0\u5f80\u6b27\u6d32\u7684\u8239\u8d39\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5979.", "note_en": "In video 1701 we get to machine open the Capitol Industries magnetic lock and see how it works!

on-site job interview at Google. The position I was interviewing for was a Google SRE. SRE stands for Site Reliability Engineering. Site reliability engineers (SREs) are both software engineers and systems administrators, responsible for Google&#39;s production services from end-to-end.\n I interviewed with eight separate people. The first three were over the phone and the remaining five were on-site. The first interview was with the recruiter and was not very technical but the other seven were technical.\n Unfortunately, I just learned that I&#39;m not getting hired. The recruiter said that &#34;the morning interviews were not that great&#34; and &#34;I should get more experience to work in their mission critical team.&#34;\n Update: This article has been  translated to Japanese.  Update: This article has been  translated to German.\n  Shortly after I published the  Code Reuse in Google Chrome post, I was contacted by a recruiter at Google. The email said:\n I recruit top notch Software Engineering talent at Google. I recently came across your name as a possible world class Engineer and am intrigued to know more about you. I promise to exchange some detailed info about us as well. Interested to hear more? Want to be an impact player at Google? Then please respond with a current (English) copy of your resume and I&#39;ll be happy to call you and discuss.\n At first I thought I would be applying for a software developer position but after we went through my skillset, the recruiter concluded that I would better fit as an SRE. I agreed with him. This seemed like a perfect position for me. I love system administration as much as I love programming.\n  The first interview was on 10th of September with the recruiter. He explained the Google recruitment process to me and we went through my skill set. I had to rank myself from 0 - 10 in a bunch of areas such as C programming (8), C++ programming (7), Python programming (6), networking (6), algorithms and data structures (6), distributed systems (5), Linux systems administration (9), and others.\n Based on my answers, we concluded that SRE was the best position for me. An SRE has to know everything: algorithms, data structures, programming, networking, distributed systems, scalable architecture, troubleshooting. It&#39;s a great hacker position!\n The second half of the interview had some basic technical questions to make sure I wasn&#39;t bluffing. The questions were about Linux systems administration, algorithms, computer architecture and C programming. You can find all questions from all interviews at the bottom of this post.\n I made a couple of mistakes but he was satisfied and we scheduled the next phone interview. He warned me that it will be very technical and I should do a really good preparation. I asked him to give me a plenty of time for the preparation and we scheduled the next interview on 22nd of September.\n He also told me that each phone interview is going to be 45 minutes to 1 hour long.\n I created a daily schedule and started preparing. I found three presentations on what SRE is all about:\n        As I did not know which programming language I will use in the next interviews, I went through dozens of recipes in  C++ Cookbook,  Python Cookbook, and  Perl Cookbook.\n  The second phone interview was with an engineer from Google. He worked on the Ads team which is responsible for running AdSense, AdWords, and other advertisement stuff.\n The interview was very technical and started with an algorithmic problem which was too large to fit in computer memory. I had to tell him precisely how I would get around this problem and what data structures and algorithms I would use. He also asked me to think out loudly. The interview continued with questions about data structures, DNS, TCP protocol, a security vulnerability associated with TCP, networking in general, and Google itself.\n   After the interview the engineer had to write feedback to the recruiter. It was positive and I could move on with the interview.\n  I gave myself more time to prepare and the third interview was on the 1st of October. It was with an engineer from the Google traffic team.\n In this interview, I had a very simple programming question and I had to do coding over phone. I was free to choose the language and I chose Perl as it is my most favorite programming language. It was impossible to dictate Perl syntax over phone &#34;for my dollar sign element open paren at data close paren open curly brace ... close curly brace&#34; so I submitted my Perl program over the email.\n   The question was: Write a program to find the set difference. Given two sets A and B, find elements in A-B, or in other words, find elements in set A that are not in B.\n Then the same problem was taken to the next level, what if the data we are working on is gigabytes in size, terabytes in size. How would my program/solution change?\n Finally I had a question about DNS again, then HTTP protocol, routing, and TCP data transfer.\n   The feedback was again positive and I could prepare for the on-site interviews. In my conversation with my recruiter I got to know that there will be five on-site interviews, each exactly 45 minutes long. One on my previous work experience, one on algorithms and data structures, one on troubleshooting and networking, and two on software development with the focus on C and C++.\n    The fourth interview was finally at Googleplex in Mountain View. At 10am I met my recruiter and we had a 15 minute discussion about the interviews. He told me I would have two interviews now, then one of Google engineers would take me to lunch in one of Google&#39;s restaurants and then I would have three other interviews.\n At 10:15am the first on-site interview began. It was about my previous job experience. I have had a lot of job experience in the past and I decided to tell about a physical security notification system that I coded in C on Linux a few years ago. The system received messages through the serial port, send out emails through SMTP, and text messages through a GSM modem.\n In the last minutes of the interview he asked me some basic Unix filesystem questions, such as, what is an inode?\n   The fifth interview began at 11am. It was a coding session and began with a trick question and not a real coding problem. The trick question was this: &#34;What&#39;s the angle between clock hands when it&#39;s 3:15?&#34; Then I was asked to implement the solution in C for arbitrary time (hour/minute). The solution was a mathematical expression that was a one-line return statement. Then I was asked to write an implementation of a binary tree on the whiteboard. While coding, I forgot to initialize a data structure that I had mallow()&#39;ed. The program would have segfault&#39;ed in real life and I would have noticed the error. I said there were no errors here but the Google engineer pointed out I hadn&#39;t initialized data.\n After this interview I was taken to lunch by the engineer who interviewed me on the second phone interview. She told me she was working at Google for two years and was very happy about it. We went to Asian food restaurant in Googleplex. Then she showed me around Googleplex.\n  The sixth interview began at 12:45pm. It was a troubleshooting and networking interview. The interviewer drew a network diagram on the whiteboard and had imagined a problem in there. I had to ask a bunch of specific networking questions to locate the problem. He was satisfied and in the last few minutes of the interview he asked me some specific networking device questions, like what&#39;s the difference between a router and a switch, and what&#39;s OSI model.\n  The seventh interview began at 1:30pm. It was a coding session. I was asked to implement a simple string manipulation subroutine that finds common characters in two C strings. I could use either C or C++. I chose C. I made an off-by-one mistake there. The whole interview focused on this one problem.\n  The last, eight, interview began at 2:15pm. It was algorithms and data structures interview. The problem presented here was similar to the problem in the 2nd interview. Not only was it a problem too large to fit in computer memory but it also was distributed. How to sort data that doesn&#39;t fit in memory and you&#39;ve got 100 computers to sort it. I had to do all kinds of trickery to solve it. The interview was very free-style and we talked back and forth about the problem. I arrived at the correct solution near the end of the interview and he said that not many candidates got that far. I was also asked if I knew map-reduce and of course I knew map-reduce as I just had read the Google paper. This was a map-reduce problem.\n After the interview the engineer escorted me out to the lobby and I took a cab back to my hotel.\n  Overall, the Google interview was super fun. I love trivia questions like this. The questions were technical but not very challenging or difficult.\n  Given 100GB file and a computer with 1GB of memory, how would you sort it.", "posttime": "2020-05-09 17:29:23", "source_domain":

experienced less mental strain than the control group. They also had a more positive perception of their economic welfare. The interpretation of the employment effects of the experiment is complicated by the introduction of the activation model in 2018.\n    A two-year basic income experiment was carried out in Finland in 2017-2018. The evaluation study is now available. The register data on employment now cover both years of the experiment and a more thorough analysis has been made of the results of the survey. In addition, the interview-based survey of basic income recipients complements the overall picture.\n  In accordance with the preliminary plan for the evaluation, the employment effects of the basic income experiment were measured for the period from November 2017 to October 2018. The employment rate for basic income recipients improved slightly more during this period than for the control group. During the reference period, the basic income increased the number of days of employment by 6 days and the basic income recipients were employed for 78 days on average.\n  However, the interpretation of the effects of the experiment is made more complicated by the introduction of the activation model at the beginning of 2018, which meant more stringent entitlement criteria for unemployment benefits asymmetrically in both groups.\n  - The effects of the second year of the experiment cannot be separated from the effects of the activation model, says Kari H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, Chief Researcher at the VATT Institute for Economic Research.\n  During the first year of the experiment, when the activation model had not yet been introduced, the basic income did not have any employment effects for the basic income recipients at group level. However, the basic income seems to have had slightly different effects on different groups: for instance for families with children who received a basic income, employment rates improved during both years of the experiment. The results for different groups are still uncertain due to the small number of observations and the numerous tests.\n  - All in all, the employment effects were small. This indicates that for some persons who receive unemployment benefits from Kela the problems related to finding employment are not related to bureaucracy or to financial incentives, says H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen.\n    The effects of the basic income experiment on wellbeing were studied through a survey which was done by phone just before the experiment ended.\n  Survey respondents who received a basic income described their wellbeing more positively than respondents in the control group. They were more satisfied with their lives and experienced less mental strain, depression, sadness and loneliness. They also had a more positive perception of their cognitive abilities, i.e. memory, learning and ability to concentrate.\n  \u2013 In addition, the respondents who received a basic income had a more positive perception of their income and economic wellbeing than the control group. They were more likely to find that their financial situation is manageable and that they are protected financially, says Minna Ylik\u00e4nn\u00f6, Head of the Research Team at Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland).\n  The basic income recipients trusted other people and the institutions in society to a larger extent and were more confident in their own future and their ability to influence things than the control group. This may be due to the basic income being unconditional, which in previous studies has been seen to increase people\u2019s trust in the system.  \u00a0  \u2013 On the basis of the study, it is not possible to say with certainty that the better wellbeing of the test group was due specifically to receipt of a basic income. Then again, regional and local basic income experiments in other countries have also shown similar results of improved wellbeing, says Ylik\u00e4nn\u00f6.\n  The response rate for the survey was 23% (31% for the basic income recipients and 20% for the control group), which is typical for surveys.\n    A total of 81 basic income recipients were also interviewed for the study. The interviews highlight the diverse effects of the experiment and the differences in the starting points and life situations of the basic income recipients.\n  Some interviewees said that the basic income experiment clearly had an effect on employment whereas others said that the effects were small. The different starting points of the interviewees before the experiment also affected employment.\n  For some the experiment offered new opportunities of participating in society for instance through voluntary work or informal care. Many interviewees said that the basic income strengthened the feeling of autonomy. Even though the descriptions of the effects of the basic income were on the whole fairly positive, for some the experiment had also created pressure to find a job and difficulties with the ability to cope.\n  - The basic income seems to have increased activity of different kinds among those who were active already earlier. Then again, for those who were in a challenging life situation before the experiment, the basic income does not seem to have solved their problems, says Helena Blomberg-Kroll, professor at the University of Helsinki.\n    - The basic income experiment has provided valuable information about the possibilities of the social security system. The information provided by the experiment can also be used when reforming the social security system, says Aino-Kaisa Pekonen, Minister of Social Affairs and Health.\n  The Finnish basic income experiment was the world\u2019s first basic income experiment that was nationwide, statutory and based on a randomised field experiment. Participation in the experiment was not voluntary, which means that it is possible to draw more reliable conclusions of the effects of the experiment than is the case in other experiments which are based on voluntary participation.\n  - The implementation of the experiment was successful and it provided new information that would not have been available without the experiment. It also showed that in Finland the arranging of extensive social experiments is possible from a legislative viewpoint, says Olli Kangas, Programme Leader at the Strategic Research Council, Academy of Finland.\n  In the basic income experiment, 2,000 unemployed persons were paid a monthly tax-exempt basic income of 560 euros regardless of any other income they may have had or whether they were actively looking for work. The basic income recipients were selected through random sampling among those who in November 2016 received an unemployment benefit from Kela. The control group consisted of those who in November 2016 received an unemployment benefit from Kela but were not selected for the experiment.\n  The experiment was begun on 1 January 2017 and ended on 31 December 2018. The decision to conduct the experiment was made by the Government of the then Prime Minister Juha Sipil\u00e4. The aim was to study how it would be possible to reshape the Finnish social security system so that it better meets the challenges posed by changes in working life. The experiment was implemented by Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland).\n    The results of the basic income experiment will be published in an online broadcast on 6 May at 13.00-15.00 (Finnish time). The publication is arranged in cooperation between Kela, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and The University of Helsinki&#39;s Think Corner.

"note_en": "Humans\u2019 ability to efficiently shed heat has enabled us to range over every continent, but a wet-bulb temperature (TW) of 35\u00b0C marks our upper physiological limit, and much lower values have serious health and productivity impacts. Climate models project the first 35\u00b0C TW occurrences by the mid-21st century. However, a comprehensive evaluation of weather station data shows that some coastal subtropical locations have already reported a TW of 35\u00b0C and that extreme humid heat overall has more than doubled in frequency since 1979. Recent exceedances of 35\u00b0C in global maximum sea surface temperature provide further support for the validity of these dangerously high TW values. We find the most extreme humid heat is highly localized in both space and time and is correspondingly substantially underestimated in reanalysis products. Our findings thus underscore the serious challenge posed by humid heat that is more intense than previously reported and increasingly severe.\n Humans\u2019 bipedal locomotion, naked skin, and sweat glands are constituents of a sophisticated cooling system (  1). Despite these thermoregulatory adaptations, extreme heat remains one of the most dangerous natural hazards (  2), with tens of thousands of fatalities in the deadliest events so far this century (  3,   4). The additive impacts of heat and humidity extend beyond direct health outcomes to include reduced individual performance across a range of activities, as well as large-scale economic impacts (  5\u2013  7). Heat-humidity effects have prompted decades of study in military, athletic, and occupational contexts (  8,   9). However, consideration of wet-bulb temperature (TW) from the perspectives of climatology and meteorology began more recently (  10,   11).\n While some heat-humidity impacts can be avoided through acclimation and behavioral adaptation (  12), there exists an upper limit for survivability under sustained exposure, even with idealized conditions of perfect health, total inactivity, full shade, absence of clothing, and unlimited drinking water (  9,   10). A normal internal human body temperature of 36.8\u00b0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C requires skin temperatures of around 35\u00b0C to maintain a gradient directing heat outward from the core (  10,   13). Once the air (dry-bulb) temperature (T) rises above this threshold, metabolic heat can only be shed via sweat-based latent cooling, and at TW exceeding about 35\u00b0C, this cooling mechanism loses its effectiveness altogether. Because the ideal physiological and behavioral assumptions are almost never met, severe mortality and morbidity impacts typically occur at much lower values\u2014for example, regions affected by the deadly 2003 European and 2010 Russian heat waves experienced TW values no greater than 28\u00b0C (fig. S1). In the literature to date, there have been no observational reports of TW exceeding 35\u00b0C and few reports exceeding 33\u00b0C (  9,   11,   14,   15). The awareness of a physiological limit has prompted modeling studies to ask how soon it may be crossed. Results suggest that, under the business-as-usual RCP8.5 emissions scenario, TW could regularly exceed 35\u00b0C in parts of South Asia and the Middle East by the third quarter of the 21st century (  14\u2013  16).\n Here, we use quality-assured station observations from HadISD (  17,   18) and high-resolution reanalysis data from ERA-Interim (  19,   20), verified against radiosondes and marine observations (see the Supplementary Materials) (  21,   22), to compute TW baseline values, geographic patterns, and recent trends. Uncertainties in TW from station data due to instrumentation and procedures are on the order of 0.5\u00b0 to 1.0\u00b0C in all regions considered, an important consideration for proper interpretation of the results. Our approach of using TW and sea surface temperature (SST) observations as guidance for future TW projections offers a different line of evidence from previous research that used coupled or regional models without explicitly including historical station data.\n Our survey of the climate record from station data reveals many global TW exceedances of 31\u00b0 and 33\u00b0C and two stations that have already reported multiple daily maximum TW values above 35\u00b0C. These conditions, nearing or beyond prolonged human physiological tolerance, have mostly occurred only for 1- to 2-hours\u2019 duration (fig. S2). They are concentrated in South Asia, the coastal Middle East, and coastal southwest North America, in close proximity to extraordinarily high SSTs and intense continental heat that together favor the occurrence of extreme humid heat (  2,   14). Along coastlines, the marine influence is manifest via anomalous onshore low-level winds during midday and afternoon hours, and these wind shifts can cause rapid dew point temperature (Td) increases in arid and semiarid coastal areas (figs. S3 to S9). Regionally coherent observational evidence supports these intense values: Of the stations along the Persian Gulf coastline with at least 50% data availability over 1979 to 2017, all have a historical 99.9th percentile of TW (the value exceeded roughly 14 times in 39 years) above 31\u00b0C ( Fig. 1; see fig. S1 for the all-time maximum). In the ERA-Interim reanalysis, the highest values are similarly located over the Persian Gulf and immediately adjacent land areas, as well as parts of the Indus River Valley (fig. S10). The spatiotemporal averaging inherent in reanalysis products causes ERA-Interim to be unable to represent the short durations and small areas of critical heat stress, causing its extreme TW values to be substantially lower than those of weather stations across the tropics and subtropics (fig. S11). In the Persian Gulf and adjacent Gulf of Oman, these differences are consistently in the range of \u22122\u00b0 to \u22124\u00b0C (fig. S12). Larger bias but similar consistency is present along the eastern shore of the Red Sea, presenting a basis for future studies examining the reasons for this behavior, as well as further comparisons between station and reanalysis data.\n  Other &gt;31\u00b0C hotspots in the weather station record emerge through surveying the globally highest 99.9th TW percentiles: eastern coastal India, Pakistan and northwestern India, and the shores of the Red Sea, Gulf of California, and southern Gulf of Mexico ( Fig. 1). All are situated in the subtropics, along coastlines (typically of a semienclosed gulf or bay of shallow depth, limiting ocean circulation and promoting high SSTs), and in proximity to sources of continental heat, which together with the maritime air comprise the necessary combination for the most exceptional TW (  11). That subtropical coastlines are hotspots for heat stress has been noted previously (  23,   24); our analysis makes clear the broad geographic scope but also the large intraregional variations ( Fig. 1). Western South Asia stands as the main exception to this coastline rule, likely due to the efficient inland transport of humid air by the summer monsoon together with large-scale irrigation (  15,   25). Tropical forest and oceanic areas generally experience TW no higher than 31\u00b0 to 32\u00b0C, perhaps a consequence of the high evapotranspiration potential and cloud cover, along with the greater instability of the tropical atmosphere. However, more research is needed on the thermodynamic mechanisms that prevent these areas from attaining higher values.\n Steep and statistically significant upward trends in extreme TW frequency (exceedances of 27\u00b0, 29\u00b0, 31\u00b0, and 33\u00b0C) and magnitude are present across weather stations globally ( Fig. 2). Each frequency trend represents more than a doubling of occurrences of the corresponding threshold between 1979 and 2017. Trends in ERA-Interim are strongly correlated with those of HadISD but are smaller for the highest values ( Fig. 2), consistent with ERA-Interim\u2019s underestimation of extreme TW that is largest for the most extreme conditions (fig. S11). We also find a sharp peak in the number of global TW = 27\u00b0C and TW = 29\u00b0C extremes during the strong El Ni\u00f1o events of 1998 and 2016. Linearly detrending this global-TW-extremes time series reveals that the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) correlation is largest for TW values that are high but not unusual (~27\u00b0 to 28\u00b0C) across the tropics and subtropics (fig. S13). Further work is necessary to test to what extent this relationship may be related to the effect of ENSO on hydrological extremes at the global scale, on tropospheric-mean temperatures, or on SSTs in particular basins, and the implications of these effects for TW predictability (  26,   27). Overall, TW extremes in the tropics largely correspond on an interannual basis to mean TW (fig. S14), indicating that climate forcings and modes of internal variability resulting in mean temperature shifts can be expected to modulate tropical TW extremes. This is the case in the subtropics as well, although to a somewhat lesser extent.\n  We also observe modulation on a seasonal scale, by considering as an illustrative example the South Asian monsoon region. There, the timing of peak TW varies with the advance of the summer monsoon (  15). Splitting South Asia into \u201cearly monsoon\u201d and \u201clate monsoon\u201d subregions, we find that the number of TW extremes is largest around the time of the local climatological monsoon onset date ( Fig. 3). Although equivalent extreme values of TW are possible before, during, and after the monsoon rains in any given year, they are of a different character; especially in the northern and western parts of the subcontinent, they become continually moister and have lower dry-bulb temperatures as summer progresses. Across the globe, such temperature and humidity variations occur within a well-defined bivariate space (fig. S15). That these variations are systematically associated with the summer monsoon in South Asia emphasizes the important role of moisture, and of weather systems on synoptic to subseasonal time scales, in controlling extreme TW (  15,   28). Our findings underscore the diversity of conditions that can lead to extreme humid heat in the same location at different times, suggesting that impacts adaptation strategies may benefit from taking this recognition into account. Such intraseasonal variability in TW also matters for physiological acclimation, which requires several-day time scales to develop (  29); TW character is especially relevant when considering effects on human systems that vary in their sensitivity to humidity and temperature\u2014for example, thermoregulation and energy demand for artificial cooling are strongly affected by TW, whereas the materials that make up the built environment are principally affected by temperature alone (  13,   30).\n  While our analysis of weather stations indicates that TW has already been reported as having exceeded 35\u00b0C in limited areas for short periods, this has not yet occurred at the regional scale represented by reanalysis data, which is also the approximate scale of model projections of future TW extremes considered in previous studies (  14,   15). To increase the comparability of our station findings with these model projections, we implement a generalized extreme value (GEV) analysis to estimate the amount of global warming from the preindustrial period until TW will regularly exceed 35\u00b0C at the global hottest ERA-Interim grid cells, currently all located in the Persian Gulf area ( Fig. 4). Complete details of this procedure are in Materials and Methods. In brief, we fit a nonstationary GEV model to the grid cells experiencing the highest TW values, with the GEV location parameter a function of the annual global-mean air-temperature anomaly. This enables us to quantify how much global warming is required for annual maximum TW \u2265 35\u00b0C to become at most a 1-in-30-year event at any grid cell. We conduct this analysis solely for grid cells where the nonstationary GEV model is a significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) better fit to the annual maximum time series (1979\u20132017) than a stationary alternative. We then define the temperature of emergence (ToE) as the amount of global warming required until TW \u226535\u00b0C is at most a 1-in-30-year event at the ERA-Interim spatiotemporal scale, such that the lowest ToE at any grid cell approximates the first occurrences of TW = 35\u00b0C that are widespread and sustained enough to cause serious or fatal health impacts, as estimated from physiological studies (  6,   10,   31).\n  Our method yields a ToE of 1.3\u00b0C over the waters of the Persian Gulf (90% confidence interval, 0.81\u00b0 to 1.73\u00b0C) and of 2.3\u00b0C for nearby land grid cells (1.4\u00b0 to 3.3\u00b0C) ( Fig. 4). Adjusting these numbers for ERA-Interim\u2019s robust Persian Gulf differences of approximately \u22123\u00b0C for extreme TW (fig. S12) supports the conclusion from the station observations that recent warming has increased exceedances of TW = 35\u00b0C, but that this threshold has most likely been achieved on occasion throughout the observational record ( Fig. 2). The strong marine influence on these values is also apparent in  Fig. 1.\n To further assess the physical realism of our GEV extrapolation, we additionally examine observed annual maximum (monthly mean) SSTs. An atmospheric boundary layer fully equilibrated with the ocean surface would be at saturation and have the same temperature as the underlying SSTs, meaning that, in principle, 35\u00b0C is the lowest SST that could sustain the critical 35\u00b0C value of TW in the air above. In reality, equilibrium will not be achieved if air-mass residence times over extreme SSTs are too short, which is more likely if the vertical profile of the atmosphere allows strong surface heating to trigger deep convection (  10). Current large-scale SSTs and their trends may therefore provide some guidance as to whether our projections of extreme TW are physically plausible. It is in this context that we note monthly mean SSTs exceeding the 35\u00b0C threshold for the first time, reaching 35.2\u00b0C in the Persian Gulf in 2017 ( Fig. 5). As a result, our GEV projection of large-scale maritime TW \u2265 35\u00b0C, for less than 1.5\u00b0C warming, appears physically consistent with SST observations at the same scale. Analogous corroboration of station-based TW \u2265 35\u00b0C events is provided by point scale, hourly SST and TW across the Persian Gulf from an independent database of marine observations (see the Supplementary Materials) (  21), in which we find SSTs have exceeded 35\u00b0C in every year since 1979, with ~33% of July to September 2017 observations above this threshold. During the summer of 2017, reports of Persian Gulf over-water TW \u2265 35\u00b0C also peaked at ~6% of all TW measurements there.\n The station-based approach that we take here and the model-based approach taken in previous studies (  14\u2013  16) represent different methods for obtaining valuable perspective on the genesis and characteristics of global TW extremes. The primary strength of station data is its ability to precisely capture local conditions, but even the best-available station data have limitations, uncertainties, and potential unobserved humidity biases (for example, due to observational procedures, instrumentation type, or siting), as well as highly incomplete spatial coverage (see discussion in the Supplementary Materials) (  32,   33). In contrast, reanalysis products and high-resolution regional models satisfy the need for spatiotemporal continuity and consistency and allow analysis of additional variables, but often underestimate extremes (  34).\n In this study, we demonstrate that efforts to better understand extreme TW would benefit from further close examination, and improved standardization and integration, of station data to alleviate model shortcomings\u2014especially along coasts where TW can vary markedly over small distances and where high-quality humidity data are therefore essential\u2014but that station-based and physical modeling\u2013based approaches are fundamentally complementary. Further research into the origins of extreme-TW biases in gridded products and continued advances in data assimilation would also help enable the development of a more unified approach drawing on all available sources of knowledge. For instance, it is important to understand the treatment of extreme values in reanalyses, and whether false-positive or false-negative rejections might be taking place, particularly as temperature and humidity distributions shift toward ever-higher values. Key multiscale TW processes necessitating closer comparison between observations and models include coastal upwelling, atmospheric convection, land-atmosphere interactions, and atmospheric variability linked to SSTs (  28)\u2014for instance, at the hourly, 1- to 10-km scale. Detailed analyses of individual events could help illuminate the unfolding interactions of processes and provide additional investigative power, such as in tracing and forecasting the rapid increases in humidity, which tend to accompany TW extremes (fig. S5), and in assessing the role of topography and land use/land cover in creating apparent TW hotspots (fig. S4). Studies comparing biases and trends in TW and SSTs among reanalyses, models, and regions would be especially beneficial, as would investigation of the sensitivity of extreme-TW projections to historical variability, changes in forcing patterns, and statistical methodologies.\n Imminent severe humid heat provides incentive for a broad interdisciplinary research initiative to better characterize health impacts. Increased collection of high-resolution health data, international collaborations with public health experts and social scientists, and dedicated modeling projects would aid in answering questions about how vulnerable populations (such as the elderly, outdoor laborers, and those with preexisting health conditions) will be adversely affected as peak TW advances further into the extreme ranges we consider here. Of particular salience is the need to ascertain how acclimation to high-heat-stress conditions is diminished as the physiological survivability limit is approached. Such efforts may also help resolve the reasons for the paucity of reported mortality and morbidity impacts associated with observed near 35\u00b0C conditions (  11,   14).\n Our findings indicate that reported occurrences of extreme TW have increased rapidly at weather stations and in reanalysis data over the last four decades and that parts of the subtropics are very close to the 35\u00b0C survivability limit, which has likely already been reached over both sea and land. These trends highlight the magnitude of the changes that have taken place as a result of the global warming to date. At the spatial scale of reanalysis, we project that TW will regularly exceed 35\u00b0C at land grid points with less than 2.5\u00b0C of warming since preindustrial\u2014a level that may be reached in the next several decades (  35). According to our weather station analysis, emphasizing land grid points underplays the true risks of extreme TW along coastlines, which tends to occur when marine air masses are advected even slightly onshore (  14). The southern Persian Gulf shoreline and northern South Asia are home to millions of people, situating them on the front lines of exposure to TW extremes at the edge of and outside the range of natural variability in which our physiology evolved (  36). The deadly heat events already experienced in recent decades are indicative of the continuing trend toward increasingly extreme humid heat, and our findings underline that their diverse, consequential, and growing impacts represent a major societal challenge for the coming decades.\n We use HadISD, version 2.0.1.2017f, which is produced by the Met Office Hadley Centre as a more rigorously quality-controlled version of the National Climatic Data Center Integrated Surface Database (ISD) (  17,   18). HadISD results from the implementation of additional data availability and quality control procedures to ISD, including checks on both temperature and Td, the two variables required for computing TW.
