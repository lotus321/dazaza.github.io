The earnings from music and merchandise amounted to 15x Bandcamp\u2019s normal haul for a 24-hour period, with 11 items being sold per second.\n Earlier this week, the site said that it would  continue to do so for the first Friday of the next three months. That includes June 5, July 3 and today. Don\u2019t know where to start? Might I recommend checking out the new album  Ultrasonic from Field Works?\u00a0It\u2019s a lovely and engrossing ambient work built using field recordings of the endangered Indiana bats. Haven\u2019t bats had it rough enough of late?\n If you need further recommendations, 150 artists and labels are also participating in a number of different ways. Some, like Arts &amp; Crafts, Kill Rock Stars, Sub Pop, Saddlecreek, Merge and Matador are also giving all of the revenue to artists. Others like Cloud Nothings, Deerhoof and my personal favorite, The Hold Steady, have released new material. Others, like Cooking Vinyl and Sufjan Stevens, are giving proceeds to related charity. Here\u2019s  the full list.\n Seems like a nice win-win all around. And hey, we could all use a little new music to get through this.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:06:06", "tags": "\u827a\u672f,\u4eca\u5929,waiving,\u827a\u672f\u5bb6,artists", "title":

Thanks for all the quick answers! \u2013\u00a0 raylu\n  @MartijnPieters While typing my answer I thought this must have been asked before, but I guess it can be difficult to google. This  question could be another duplicate. \u2013\u00a0 jorgeca\n  Related to my question:  Why does (1 in [1,0] == True) evaluate to False? \u2013\u00a0 Peter Wood\n  I think this would make an excellent interview question for someone who answers &#34;10&#34; to the question &#34;on a scale of 1 to 10, how are your python skills&#34;? \u2013\u00a0 Bryan Oakley\n   This can be surprising in this case, but lets you write  1 &lt;= x &lt; 4 unlike in other languages like C.\n  @NullUserException Mmm I think they can&#39;t be needed because the possible operators are  &#34;&lt;&#34; | &#34;&gt;&#34; | &#34;==&#34; | &#34;&gt;=&#34; | &#34;&lt;=&#34; | &#34;&lt;&gt;&#34; | &#34;!=&#34; | &#34;is&#34; [&#34;not&#34;] | [&#34;not&#34;] &#34;in&#34; which all have less precedence than  and. (By the way, thanks for the grammar fix, that really helps us non native speakers). \u2013\u00a0 jorgeca\n  And this is exactly why I tend to wrap compound logical comparisons in parens, I simply can&#39;t remember the syntax across all the languages I use, and it&#39;s not worth the risk of leaving them off and having unexpected behavior. \u2013\u00a0 zzzzBov\n    x &lt; y &lt;= z is equivalent to x &lt; y and y &lt;= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x &lt; y is found to be false).\n In your case  True == False is False is equivalent to  True == False and False is False as the first condition is  False so it short-circuits and return  False.\n &gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(lambda : True == False is False) 1 0 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 (True) 3 LOAD_GLOBAL 1 (False) 6 DUP_TOP 7 ROT_THREE 8 COMPARE_OP 2 (==) 11 JUMP_IF_FALSE_OR_POP 21 &lt;---------this step 14 LOAD_GLOBAL 1 (False) 17 COMPARE_OP 8 (is) 20 RETURN_VALUE &gt;&gt; 21 ROT_TWO 22 POP_TOP 23 RETURN_VALUE\n  I didn&#39;t downvote, but it seems to me that the description of the language&#39;s rules is quite enough to understand what&#39;s going on. The disassembly doesn&#39;t seem to add much (other than a focus on implementation-specific details). \u2013\u00a0 cHao\n   Unlike C, all comparison operations in Python have the same priority, which is lower than that of any arithmetic, shifting or bitwise operation. Also unlike C, expressions like a &lt; b &lt; c have the interpretation that is conventional in mathematics:\n comparison ::= or_expr ( comp_operator or_expr )*comp_operator ::= &#34;&lt;&#34; | &#34;&gt;&#34; | &#34;==&#34; | &#34;&gt;=&#34; | &#34;&lt;=&#34; | &#34;&lt;&gt;&#34; | &#34;!=&#34; | &#34;is&#34; [&#34;not&#34;] | [&#34;not&#34;] &#34;in&#34;\n   True == False is False is a chained comparison, which means the same as  (True == False) and (False is False). Since the first comparison ( True==False) is false, the result of the chained comparison is False.\n  Not the answer you&#39;re looking for?

"note_en": "Upon re-reading  Mathematical Apocrypha,a collection of tales dealing with great mathematicians as well as theirquirks and foibles, I thought about my own interactions with some of TheElders of Mathematics\u00a0(from here on abbreviated as THEM) and what Iwould add to such a book. While I have a few interesting and potentiallyfunny anecdotes to tell, one story stands out in my mind, because it hadan extraordinarily positive impact on my life.\n  When I started studying mathematics, I fell in with the wrong crowd, onecould say. Most of them had received additional tutoring  prior to evenstarting their studies  1, they knew all the things about eldritch loresuch as  complex numbers  2 and  vector spaces. Most of them, throughno fault of their own, came from every affluent and academic households,whereas my own origins are more down-to-earth and thrifty. So, to make along story short, I was in  aweof them: they seemed to know everythingabout  ...\n  Looking back with some wisdom now, I groan inwardly at this sorry way ofattempting to assert dominance. It certainly worked for me, though, as Iwas feeling increasingly out of place. Understanding all concepts took asizeable amount of time and intellectual effort for me, and I was not inthe-\u2018I-immediately-get-everything-when-being-exposed-to-it-for-the-firsttime-ever\u2019 frame of mind. So, in short, I was miserable, but I continuedto study, wondering sometimes whether I really was  thatmuch slower  ...\n  I was happy to see the second term, though, and still hung out with thisgroup at times. We were reduced in numbers, but the general tone was oneof \u2018smarter-than-thou\u2019 still and not changing. Yet, things  did change,mostly because of one course: linear algebra 2. It was given by  Prof.Matthias Kreck, who wasalso the teacher of the first instalment of the course. But Prof. Kreckdecided to go \u2018off-script \u2019and started quicklyveering off into the realms of algebraic and differential topology,trying  ...\n For me, the subject was breath of fresh air: Prof. Kreck has a veryidiosyncratic teaching style: at one point, he brought his cello intothe lecture hall to play a song; in another lecture, he took of hisleather belt, made it into a  M\u00f6bius loop,and started using chalk to draw little arrows on it \u2014this was all doneto empirically show that this particular object cannot be oriented.I loved these glimpses of topology, and I started to be interested inthe whole topic \u2014I even started reading current  ...\n  At some point, my \u2018research\u2019 made me stumble on the work by  GrigoriPerelman on the  Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture. This was my first contact with THEM.Thanks to the arXiv, I was able to browse away and discovered a treasuretrove of papers. At some point, I even discovered a paper by none otherthan  Terence Tao, who wasproviding a  non-linear PDEperspective on the proof ofPerelman.\n Wading through all that literature was daunting \u2014I had to look upalmost every other concept (Ricci flow is not part of the standardundergraduate curriculum if you are in your second semester), but I wasdetermined to go through with this, and a crazy plan formed: I wanted tofully understand the proof of the conjecture! But I needed more toolsfor that. So, at some point, I cornered Prof. Kreck after a lecture. Hewas always happy to answer questions of the students, and even though Ifound  ...\n I screwed up my courage, approached the great sage, and asked himsomething along the lines of \u2018Prof. Kreck, I really would love tounderstand the proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Do you have any tipsfor me?\u2019 He looked at me calmly and replied something like \u2018Not really,but best of luck to you; maybe  you can it explain it to  me once you understand it.\u2019\n I was absolutely  flummoxed! Here is a member of THEM, confessing hisown ignorance of a subject! Prof. Kreck expanded a little bit on thisanswer and basically explained to me that it might takes  yearsofstudying to finally grasp all the nuances of the proof and, since it wasnot directly within his realm of expertise in topology, he was justas clueless about certain concepts than I was. The major differencebeing that he was more experienced at feeling clueless, and knew moreconcepts for  ...\n Similar to the novice in many of the Zen koans, I truly was enlightened in this moment. If one of THEM can express ignorance abouta topic, surely, ignorance is not that bad to begin with. I realisedthat the power of truly mastering a subject lies in realising that youdo  not necessarily understand everything\u2014and being honest about it!My life was changed  6, and I was gently steered towards being moreintellectually honest.\n  There  isa power in being as honest and outspoken as Prof. Kreck was.Here is this proficient and prolific member of THEM, and he could havejust made up something on the spot to make me feel dumb. Instead, hechose the intellectually honest option, and made it clear that this isthe normal state of affairs in mathematics (or any sufficientlycomplicated topic). I relish the fact that such a small action couldhave such a profound impact on one person, and I am grateful thatI dared pose my  ...\n In the years since, in my own dealings with researchers, I never oncefeigned knowledge when I was not feeling sufficiently confident aboutit. I think it is important to be honest about what you know and whatyou do  not know. Ignorance is not a moral blemish\u2014 pretending tobe smarter than you are  is\u00a0(just as choosing to remain in astate of ignorance is).\n So the moral of this story is: do not be afraid of not knowing or notunderstanding something. It even happens to THEM.\n Whereas I did not even  know that such a thing was possible, andstarted studies woefully under-prepared\u2014or so I thought.  \u21a9\ufe0e\n It  was the first term for me, and while I had heard about thisin high school, it was being talked about in hushed voices, similar tohow one would talk about certain things of an immoral nature. The factthat complex numbers somehow arose in equations that did not havea \u2018real\u2019 solution, made them all the more advanced to me at that time.  \u21a9\ufe0e\n It would only later dawn on me that they were probably just fullof manure the whole time, but this wisdom was acquired over the yearsand not accessible at the time that I needed it.  \u21a9\ufe0e\n By that time, I was so accustomed to being \u2018in over my head\u2019 thatthere was really nothing that could knock me off balance any more. Itwas a mild surprise to see that I  could follow along with somepapers for at least a few paragraphs, or pages, until I started todrown in unfamiliar terminology and jargon.  \u21a9\ufe0e\n  Again, I only properly realised this much later, but thiscertainly was a  change point in my career!  \u21a9\ufe0e", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:59", "tags": "\u65e0\u77e5,admitting,\u6570\u5b66,started",

"note_en": "Awk is a tiny programming language and a command line tool. It&#39;sparticularly appropriate for log parsing on servers, mostly because Awk willoperate on files, usually structured in lines of human-readable text.\n I say it&#39;s useful on servers because log files, dump files, or whatevertext format servers end up dumping to disk will tend to grow large, and you&#39;llhave many of them per server. If you ever get into the situation where you haveto analyze gigabytes of files from 50 different servers without tools like Splunk or its equivalents, it would feelfairly bad to have and download all these files locally to then drive someforensics on them.\n This personally happens to me when some Erlang nodes tend to die andleave a  crashdump of 700MB to 4GB behind, or on smaller individual servers (say a VPS)where I need to quickly go through logs, looking for a common pattern.\n In any case, Awk does more than finding data (otherwise,  grepor  ack would be enough) \u2014 it also lets you process thedata and transform it.\n   # comment Pattern1  {  ACTIONS ;  } # comment Pattern2  {  ACTIONS ;  } # comment Pattern3  {  ACTIONS ;  } # comment Pattern4  {  ACTIONS ;  }\n Every line of the document to scan will have to go through each of thepatterns, one at a time. So if I pass in a file that contains the followingcontent:\n  Then the content  this is line 1 will match against Pattern1. If it matches,  ACTIONS will be executed.Then  this is line 1 will match against  Pattern2.If it doesn&#39;t match, it skips to  Pattern3, and so on.\n Once all patterns have been cleared,  this is line 2 will gothrough the same process, and so on for other lines, until the input has beenread entirely.\n   Awk only has two main data types: strings and numbers. And even then,Awk likes to convert them into each other. Strings can be interpretedas numerals to convert their values to numbers. If the string doesn&#39;tlook like a numeral, it&#39;s  0.\n Both can be assigned to variables in  ACTIONS parts of your codewith the  = operator. Variables can be declared anywhere, at anytime, and used even if they&#39;re not initialized: their default value is &#34;&#34;, the empty string.\n Finally, Awk has arrays. They&#39;re unidimensional associative arraysthat can be started dynamically. Their syntax is just var[key] = value. Awk can  simulate multidimensional arrays, but it&#39;s all a big hack anyway.\n  The patterns that can be used will fall into three broad categories:regular expressions, Boolean expressions, and special patterns.\n  The Awk regular expressions are your run of the mill regexes. They&#39;re notPCRE under  awk (but  gawk will support the fancierstuff \u2014 it depends on the implementation! See with  awk--version), though for most usages they&#39;ll do plenty:\n /admin/  {  ...  }  # any line that contains &#39;admin&#39; /^admin/  {  ...  }  # lines that begin with &#39;admin&#39; /admin$/  {  ...  }  # lines that end with &#39;admin&#39; /^[0-9.]+ /  {  ...  }  # lines beginning with series of numbers and periods /(POST|PUT|DELETE)/  # lines that contain specific HTTP verbs\n And so on. Note that the patterns  cannot capture specificgroups to make them available in the  ACTIONS part of the code.They are specifically to match content.\n Boolean expressions are similar to what you would find in PHP or Javascript.Specifically, the operators  &amp;&amp; (&#34;and&#34;),  ||(&#34;or&#34;), and  ! (&#34;not&#34;) are available. This is also what you&#39;ll findin pretty much all C-like languages. They&#39;ll operate on any regular data type.\n What&#39;s specifically more like PHP and Javascript is the comparison operator, ==, which will do fuzzy matching, so that the string &#34;23&#34; compares equal to the number  23, such that &#34;23&#34; == 23 is  true. The operator  != is alsoavailable, without forgetting the other common ones:  &gt;, &lt;,  &gt;=, and  &lt;=. You can also mix up the patterns: Boolean expressions can be used along withregular expressions. The pattern  /admin/ || debug == trueis validand will match when a  ...\n Note that if you have a specific string or variable you&#39;d want to matchagainst a regex, the operators  ~ and  !~ are whatyou want, to be used as  string ~ /regex/  ...\n      The first one is  BEGIN, which matches only  beforeany line has been input to the file. This is basically where you can initiatevariables and all other kinds of state  ...\n There is also  END, which as you may have guessed, will match afterthe whole input has been handled. This lets you clean up ordo some final output before exiting.  ...\n Finally, the last kind of pattern is a bit hard to classify. It&#39;s halfwaybetween variables and special values, and they&#39;re called  Fields, whichdeserve  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:56", "tags": "awk,\u6587\u4ef6", "title":

begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.\n  Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government on Friday said India - the country with the largest number of people in lockdown - would extends its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 illness, but allow \u201cconsiderable relaxations\u201d in lower-risk districts.\n As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu - meaning Health Bridge - a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the

I find this absolutely hilarious, especially since he did this a while back and got fined like several million dollars for tinkering with market or something illegal like that.\n Anyway, I asked myself: can we causally attribute Tesla tanking stock price to this tweet?\n The answer is yes, yes, we absolutely can. In the following I use a synthetic control approach to estimate the causal impact of Musk\u2019s tweet on the Tesla stock price (God I hate that I just wrote that sentence). You can read more about this approach in  Brodersen et al. ( 2015).\n I used the S&amp;P500 as my synthetic control and pull 1-minute resolution ticker data using Tiingo with the  riingo package, then blindly shoved the data into  CausalImpact. We get the following:\n  In the first panel, the blue is Tesla stock price as predicted by the S&amp;P 500 based on a Bayesian state space model, and the black is the actual Tesla stock price. Elon tweets at the dashed vertical line. You can see that before the tweet, Tesla stock prices are well-predicted by the S&amp;P 500, and afterwards, the Tesla stock drops to prices lower than predicted based on the S&amp;P 500. The current best estimate is that the tweet is responsible for about a $40 drop in the price of Tesla,  ...\n Of course, you probably shouldn\u2019t believe these estimates since I didn\u2019t generate them with neural net.\n Anyway, I\u2019m gonna go finish a topology takehome now, and try to tank my grade by less than Elon tanked his stock. In the meantime, you should all read  Brodersen et al. ( 2015), it\u2019s great. Everyone else, continue shitposting.

"note_en": "An enjoyable 25-minute introductory talk:  YOW! Lambda Jam 2019 - Ken Scambler - Applied Category Theory ( slides)\n What do programming, quantum physics, chemistry, neuroscience, systems biology, natural language parsing, causality, network theory, game theory, dynamical systems and database theory have in common?\n As functional programmers, we know how useful category theory can be for our work - or perhaps how abstruse and distant it can seem. What is less well known is that applying category theory to the real world is an exciting field of study that has really taken off in just the last few years. It turns out that we share something big with other fields and industries - we want to make big things out of little things without everything going to hell! The key is compositionality, the central idea of  ...\n  By  Manuel J.

Overall, I didn&#39;t pick up, from what he was saying, how to connect the things he was talking about to the basic mathematics of category theory. That aspect of the talk came across to me as (except for some trivial bits) too hand-wavy to see actual categories in it. Admittedly, I don&#39;t consider myself to grasp a mathematical concept until I  intuitivelygrasp it, which is quite a high bar for abstract mathematics; but if I hold myself  ...\n His first line set my teeth on edge: &#34;Category theory. Some of you might know it as a valuable part of your functional programmers&#39; toolkits, others might know it as scary nonsense that some people just won&#39;t shut up about.&#34; I&#39;ve noticed some people condescendingly assume that failure to love category-based pure-functional programming can only be explained by fear of mathematics. Granted, the talk doesn&#39;t hinge on that; but it did start things off on the wrong foot, for me.\n Granted, I just skimmed, but the ideas in the talk seemed pretty shallow. I remain skeptical of the importance of category theory for programmers in general.\n This is talk intended as an introduction and invitation for people who might have never looked at category theory before. As such it qualifies as a success: it has made at least one person who hadn&#39;t looked into category theory before want to learn more about it.\n  By  Manuel J. Simoni at Thu, 2019-08-08 18:22 |  login or  register to post comments\n That&#39;s a valid measure of success. It&#39;s also fair game to ask how it could be improved.\n I&#39;ve kept wondering about this, and really wanting to give it a second look, to understand the different ways this talk has evidently struck different listeners. Now I have, and here are some further thoughts.\n \u2022 Something I&#39;ve been through a few times, and have observed others go through as well: I&#39;ll read a novel, or watch a movie, because someone highly recommended it, and it doesn&#39;t work at all for me because it keeps taking me in directions I don&#39;t expect and don&#39;t want to go. And afterward, thinking about it, I realize a major part of the trouble was that I went into it expecting a different  typeof story. Mistaken expectations can ruin what ought to be a fine piece of  ...\n \u2022 As an introduction to the subject, the earlier parts of it where I&#39;m already familiar with the mathematics seemed pretty sound. If I knew how the later parts connected to the math I might think the same about those parts; only, I don&#39;t know quite how they connect to the math, and having been guided by my prior knowledge to think of the earlier parts in those terms, when I get to the later parts I  want those connections that just aren&#39;t there.\n \u2022 A point I saw go by in his conclusions was &#34;Supports marvelous graphical languages&#34;. A written point only, I think. It resonated with an insight I&#39;ve had in mind for some years now, about how category theory sits in relation to mathematics generally. Up until about five hundred years ago, mathematics was written out in words. Imagine solving, say, a set of quartic polynomials  in Latin. Then from the 1500s forward mathematicans started to develop arithmetic notations, things  ...\n \u2022A rhetorical question (iirc) raised late in the talk: he said smart people tended to compositionality &#34;even&#34; without category theory, so how much more powerful would it be to explicitly apply category theory. That grated on me so, I just can&#39;t resist registering an objection. Explicit theory does not always improve things; somethings its effect is more to limit things. I&#39;m not saying category theory doesn&#39;t come in handy, as a tool; just that I&#39;m leery of his  ...\n The new stuff was too abstract for the simple elegant algebraic notation, so it had to be expressed in words. And things have gotten dreadfully messy because of that. But while category theory too suffers greatly from this problem with words, its saving grace is that it affords some lovely opportunities to express elegant mathematics in pictures.\n A few months ago I tried to understand LabView from NI, because some of my colleagues are using it and I wanted to know if I can perform consistency checks of LabView programs with circuit specifications exported from Comos ( e.g. checking the number of pins of a virtual instrument ). Trying to read LabView docs was a strange experience because it is all pictures with wordy explanations. NI keeps LabView clean from the infection with formal or programming language notation. The pictorial  ...\n In an alternative history, dominated by the priests of LabView, we might not have developed formal notations at all.\n FWIW, semantics for block-diagrammatic languages akin to LabView are actually well-understood . For instance,  SCADE comes with a company-vetted formal semantics.\n I&#39;m pretty sure, NI also understands LabView &#34;well&#34;. It is just that their kind of understanding flows naturally into the opposite direction. In a way I appreciate their lack of an ecumenical solution and consider it as a strength. However they cannot be completely faithful to the picture either which is why they write so many words.\n But LabVIEW in particular is relatively inconsistent (e.g. a subvi has different semantics than the subgraph, due to an implicit sequencing frame), overly stateful (e.g. those property nodes), and hides too many properties of programs behind deep menus. It&#39;s very difficult to understand or reason about a modular program, and the attack surface is basically all the things.\n We could certainly go a lot further with consistent use of pictures, cf  interaction nets.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:39", "tags": "app,\u8303\u7574,category,theory", "title": "\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u7574\u7406\u8bba--\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6027\u79d1\u5b66(2019\u5e74)", "title_en": "Applied Category Theory \u2013 The Emerging Science of Compositionality (2019)", "transed": 0, "url": "http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/5581", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["app", "\u8303\u7574", "category", "theory"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d30e905fc49d135a8b3909588634d54a.jpg", "infoid": 1000306, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u6700\u521d\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u5e73\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u3002\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u53d1\u53ea\u662f\u5c06\u6211\u7684\u521b\u9020\u529b\u5e26\u5230\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6211\u4e0d\u80fd\u8ddf\u4e0a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\uff0c\u6211\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8270\u96be\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u53ea\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8eWeb\u5f00\u53d1\u3002\u8003\u8651\u5230\u6211\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u4f1a\u8f7b\u677e\u4e00\u4e9b\uff0c\u6211\u60ca\u8bb6\u5730\u770b\u5230\u6709\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458-\u5168\u6808\u3001\u540e\u7aef\u3001\u524d\u7aef\u3001DevOps\u7b49\u3002\u8bae\u7a0b\uff1a00\uff1a00-\u4ece01\uff1a45\u5f00\u59cb-.\u7684\u5229\u5f0a.", "note_en": "I started out as a graphic designer.

To me, it&#39;s just techies doing techie things because they don&#39;t know what else to do.&#34;\n I haven&#39;t blogged about this because I thought it was obvious. But from the tweets and emails I have received, it seems not.\n This is a classic identification problem, and efficacy depends on two things: false positives and false negatives.\n False positives: Any app will have a precise definition of a contact: let&#39;s say it&#39;s less than six feet for more than ten minutes. The false positive rate is the percentage of contacts that don&#39;t result in transmissions. This will be because of several reasons. One, the app&#39;s location and proximity systems -- based on GPS and Bluetooth -- just aren&#39;t accurate enough to capture every contact. Two, the app won&#39;t be aware of any extenuating circumstances, like walls or  ...\n Assume you take the app out grocery shopping with you and it subsequently alerts you of a contact. What should you do? It&#39;s not accurate enough for you to quarantine yourself for two weeks. And without ubiquitous, cheap, fast, and accurate testing, you can&#39;t confirm the app&#39;s diagnosis. So the alert is useless.\n Similarly, assume you take the app out grocery shopping and it doesn&#39;t alert you of any contact. Are you in the clear? No, you&#39;re not. You actually have no idea if you&#39;ve been infected.\n The end result is an app that doesn&#39;t work. People will post their bad experiences on social media, and people will read those posts and realize that the app is not to be trusted. That loss of trust is even worse than having no app at all.\n It has nothing to do with privacy concerns. The idea that contact tracing can be done with an app, and not human health professionals, is just plain dumb.\n   Also, the biggest false negative: surface transmission. Someone coughs on a surface, and you touch it a minute later. You never went close to the person, and are not registered as a contact. Not that any kind of contact tracing can pick that stuff up.\n But not all techies are seduced by this - it got short shrift in this report, for instance:  https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/sites/default/files/atoms/files/covid-19_surveillance_roadmap_final.pdf - as well as Scott Gottleib, other authors have serious chops in Healthcare IT (e.g. Farzad)\n But a view from a different side: In the end, the only real tool we have is quarantine; the main question facing us is how to use it most efficiently, to maximise the cost/benefit balance. It&#39;s possible that the app will play a small role in that, though not in the simple way that you imagine, but more in giving people an estimate of the general viral load around them. It&#39;s not substitute for real contact tracing.\n or it can be left behind on a surface and picked up by someone later who was never in direct contact\n  the contact problem gets even worse if you take different living conditions into account. I&#39;m living in a house with multiple apartments. every morning I go to my workspace and sit there for 8h in front of my PC while working. my downstairs neighbor might do the same but I&#39;m pretty sure Bluetooth can&#39;t tell there&#39;s a floor between us and might count this as contact. I also have an upstairs neighbor...\n How is this specific to tracing apps? Or are you criticizing the whole idea of contact tracing to control epidemics?\n  Unfortunately it appears you haven&#39;t looked into this in enough detail, yet you&#39;re now being suddenly quoted everywhere (dangerous). Several erroneous assumptions: - Contact tracing by ONLY bluetooth will be implemented in the next updates of iOS and Android and won&#39;t require an app to function (just opt-in). That means the tracking capabilities will be available on about 80% of devices within 4-5 months on iOS. Less so on Android of course, but given the critical nature of this  ...\n At least you didn&#39;t rant about the privacy implications because, again, the new Contact Tracing APIs in Android and iOS have taken care of this as well. I would encourage you to review the information about these APIs and reconsider your post here before it&#39;s shared further.\n &#34;I&#39;m not even talking about the privacy concerns, I mean the efficacy. Does anybody think this will do something useful?\n I think it would be useful as the backbone of a subsequent traditional contact tracing investigation. I don&#39;t have perfect 14-day recall. I&#39;d prefer to have a 14-day place/contact report generated automatically the moment I contacted health professionals due to symptoms. The efficacy of the automated notifications is questionable but a &#34;trusted&#34; cross-platform OS level API for device proximity tracking seems reasonable and useful.\n the disease has some transmission rate that&#39;s less than 100% (and I don&#39;t know what that is).\n I&#39;mnot surprised, it&#39;s like trying to &#34;nail a buggy on a mule in the dark&#34; for several reasons. But two that are easy to see,\n 1, Even though  R 0 is an &#34;average&#34; it&#39;s for a moment in time, because it changes all the time, thus we have  R t when dealing with historic etc data (usually derived from a graph).\n 2, Like the Case Fataliry Rate (CFR) it&#39;s sensitive to it&#39;s inputs. Which in the case of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infection is very dificult to find out even remotely close without mass testing.\n  1, Let everyone get infected with attendant high mortality rates and getting an endemic infection with anything upto 1-6% of the worlds population dead.\n 2, Vacination, if one that is both safe and effective ever comes about (We still do not have vaccines four the four &#34;Seasonal CoV, or SARS-CoV-1)\n 3, Eradication, where the virus is robbed of hosts thus dies out and with a little luck becomes extinct. This can only be by effective &#34;Issolation&#34; not social distancing. Social distancing slows the spread it does not stop infections happening.\n As the first two are not realy options currently we are going for social distancing in the hope we can slow it enough so that healthcare has a chance to cut the death rate of the spreading infection.\n At some point social distancing is going to have to stop, because the economy will change beyond anything that would have been imagined half a year ago except by &#34;scare mongering scientists&#34;... And that sort of &#34;societal change&#34; an absolut anathema to the 1% of the 1% and other vested interests.\n      If anyone has any other ideas --and no I do not meen the idiotic &#34;herd immunity Policy&#34; carried out so disastrously in the UK etc-- then I for one would be delighted to hear about them.\n I&#39;m not an epidemiologist and may well be an idiot, but isn&#39;t this missing the point a bit? It&#39;s akin to not recommending that people wear masks on the basis that they only reduce the likelihood of transmission by a modest percentage rather than eliminating it (and yes, I know that there are also other reasons not to recommend wearing masks).\n Surely, even if an app correctly encourages only one out of every five or six vulnerable recipients to self-isolate or get tested when they wouldn&#39;t otherwise have done so, then the transmission rate is reduced, however minimally. The difference between a reproduction rate of 0.9 and 1.1 is the difference between a virus that eventually disappears in the local population and one that eventually infects almost everybody. This, in addition to other measures, still seems like quite an  ...\n Great post Bruce! But please correct the title from &#34;COVAD-19&#34; to &#34;COVID-19&#34; so it passes the most basic filters when sharing\n Richard is correct. If the contact tracing apps are billed as a complete solution, people will be disappointed. But that\u2019s not the intent; they\u2019re part of a suite of tools. They don\u2019t need to be 100% accurate to have a positive effect.\n Manual contract tracing has the exact same problems. You\u2019ll get false positives, because the virus doesn\u2019t pass to everyone you come in contact with. You\u2019ll also get false negatives, because you can\u2019t identify everyone you were close to. But manual contact tracing works, as evidenced by South Korea. There\u2019s no reason to think that good tracing apps can\u2019t be a valuable assist.\n The contact apps aren&#39;t to alert you when you are in proximity with someone who as COVID.\n They are to trace those who have been in proximity with someone who is diagnosed with COVID for sufficient time to have become possibly infected and to get them tested.\n If we weren&#39;t concerned with privacy, each individual phone user would be identified and would be required to be tested.\n But with privacy, and sufficient testing capacity, people can be notified anonymously that they were in proximity of someone positively diagnosed and they can decide whether to get tested.\n Depending on how many choose to do that, it will have at minimum, some positive impact in that more people will get tested. There is though, if the proximity detection is even partly useful, the possibility that more positive cases will be detected and people can quarantine and also be treated if needed earlier.\n That should reduce the health impact of COVID-19 and treatments are more likely to be useful in the early stages of infection.\n Hi, Bruce! I agree with your assessment of false positives/negatives but I disagree with the conclusions you draw.\n In a pandemic a single individual is not significant. What does matter, however, is the herd. There is a significant advantage to reducing the number of cases, even if some alerts are false positives or some cases go missing as false negatives.\n The alerts/testing does not have to work with 100% precision to be effective. Even with only a 50% success rate this would be a great success. Remember pandemics are all about exponential growth and 1/2^n would help reducing cases tremendously.\n I&#39;m not sure whether the terms of &#39;false positives&#39; and &#39;false negatives&#39; apply here. It is not a test. It is about creating a contact list. And yes, it will not be perfect.\n I think Richard and Clive hit my main points, but here is another three cents.\n    The argument that the bluetooth contact tracing is not reliable enough to influence behaviour. As Richard pointed out, it doesn&#39;t have to persuade everyone, just a few percent; *but also* it isn&#39;t a binary decision. Maybe someone doesn&#39;t go to a big event because he had a couple of alerts recently. Instead of being an asymptomatic mega spreader, he is just a regular spreader.\n The other main point I wanted to make is that contact tracing may not be as rigorous as human driven contact tracing, but it has other possibilities. 1. It can handle anonymous contacts ( transmission on a bus, anyone? and 2. You can go back in time! Not very far, for privacy reasons, but if you start getting warnings about contacts who weren&#39;t infection when you met them, time to test.\n Minor points. 20% in Singapore, yes they&#39;re law abiding and tend to trust the authorities, but this is a central government database system including location, which is a massive dis-incentive. It also ran as a regular app, so had to be foreground to work, and chewed battery.\n Without ubiquitous testing, this is of limited use. However, anything that helps target testing, will make testing so much more effective.\n The bluetooth contact information doesn&#39;t have to be used in isolation. Ask about symptoms, give it more weight, find downstream contacts getting sick, give it more weight.\n  Absent someone outing themselves as a professional active epidemiologist, we should be very careful about writing this off for reasons we&#39;re not sure of. I do know there was a lot of noise about how long the viral RNA can remain viable on a surface in a lab ( probably based on test from SARS-1 virus), but I&#39;m hearing a lot now about this not being a proven vector, and that the main transmission vector is probably direct.\n I&#39;m not sure you are barking up the right tree here. A contact tracing app is not an infection test and should not be mistaken as replacing one. It can however shorten the reaction time to identify a better subset of high risk individuals in the overall population that at all had the chance of being close enough for a possible infection over the previous 14 days the moment someone testes positive, so they can be tested as well and potential pre- or non-symptomatic infections  ...\n Richard and Bryant are correct, This was never meant to be a 100% purposeful solution. it was just yet another prosthetic to help us manage the problem.\n The validity of input data is also a concern - i.e. questionable due to significant rates of RT-PCR false negatives and false positives. Studies have demonstrated false negative rate of between 10 to 50%, with many experts agreeing on conservative a estimate of 20%. In Australia, TGA admits tests have not been subjected to standard validations due to the fast track approval process. If the testing accuracy is dubious, then this undermines the premise of the app. Australia hasn&#39;t  ...\n And without ubiquitous, cheap, fast, and accurate testing, you can&#39;t confirm the app&#39;s diagnosis. So the alert is useless.\n We&#39;re working on &#34;ubiquitous, cheap, fast, and accurate testing,&#34;; will you revise your post once it&#39;s there? It already is there in a bunch of countries; are apps not useful there?\n The idea is not to have only apps, but to warn people who are at increased risk to nudge them towards getting tested. Contact tracing by hand worked remarkably well in many places; the apps are supposed to aid with that.\n  &gt; 2, Vacination, if one that is both safe and effective ever comes about (We still do not have vaccines four the four &#34;Seasonal CoV, or SARS-CoV-1)\n Well, no, but as Derek Lowe has pointed out, that&#39;s mostly because nobody&#39;s bothered. SARS-CoV-1 is extinct, and it&#39;s a bit hard to test a vaccine when you have no pathogen to test it against: the SARS-CoV-1 vaccines-under-development appear to have activity against SARS-CoV-2 as well, so that&#39;s givign them a head start. As for the other human coronaviruses... all put together, they cause perhaps 15% of human colds. So a vaccine against one would cure about 25%  ...\n SARS-CoV-2 is not like that. There&#39;s only one of it, it&#39;s not very diverse (it hasn&#39;t had time, even if it didn&#39;t also have a proofreader keeping the mutation rate down), and nobody has prior exposure. A vaccine is *definitely* worthwhile.\n I think you misunderstood one very important point: If you get a warning from the app that you have been in contact with someone you shouldn \u2019t quarantine for two weeks. You should limit your contacts for the next 72h and behave as \u201epotentially infected \u201cin a reasonable way and quarantine in case you get the slightest symptoms. So really wear mask, really don \u2019t see others and really be careful with your hand hygiene. The advantage of the app will be the time to know that you  ...\n The purpose of these contact apps - regardless of design and technique - is to suggest who should be tested next. Your scenario is not in use, these apps won&#39;t ever be able to tell you if you are a &#34;positive&#34; or &#34;negative&#34;.\n So there are no false negatives or positives at all - false positives will disappear when tested, and the only disadvantage they bring is loss of the limited test supply. False negatives should not - if they follow the social distancing rules - infect other people and will show up eventually when feeling sick.\n If testing supply is sufficient, you increase the amount of physical tests to minimze the amount of false negatives (if you&#39;ve ever been in range of an infected person you will be send to a test).\n In real world conditions now somewhere between one in a hundred or one per ten thousand persons you meet is infected, depending on location. So an app - even if done badly, distributed only to some people and not working all the time may still help to create a waiting-to-be-tested line that works better than random testing.\n In a perfcet world you simply test everyone 4 times in two weeks and you&#39;re done.\n @Tyler - can you provide any more details on three levels of proximity sensing? AFAIK, South Korea had to run a battery of device calibrations in order to compensate for the different broadcasting power levels of different phones/chips; from this I conclude that Bluetooth is not a good tool to measure distances to other devices. Please explain why that is incorrect.\n Also, I would like to comment on the &#34;something is better than nothing&#34; idea: if the app reports contact with someone tested positive for Covid-19, what happens next? With a decentralized, anonymous system, it is all up to the individual. If they all run and ask for a test, the testing system might not be able to cope given too many false positives. Even if they get a test, after a few times of having a negative test despite being alerted by the app, people will stop  ...\n And at this very moment in Europe, people with severe symptoms are still not being admitted to a proper test unless they have been in contact with someone known to be positive - so there seems a very strong need to keep the testing numbers low. Adding millions of app users will not help on that. And the app will NOT help any of the official contact tracing, as officials have not access to any useful data, even if you hand over your phone. All they get are random numbers  ...\n And finally: Once such an app is in place there is a clear danger the app will become &#34;mandatory&#34;, e.g. for admission to certain places (&#34;show me your app or I will not let you in&#34;).\n I think Stefan and Tyler both make good points - this is not a replacement for a medical test, and it isn&#39;t for now. It&#39;s about identifying higher risk individuals in the future.\n Can a phone tell if you&#39;ve been infected by Covid-19? Of course not. But it can give you some degree of warning if you&#39;re at higher risk due to past proximity with someone who has tested positive. Nothing replaces proper testing, though.\n You also assert &#34;It&#39;s not accurate enough for you to quarantine yourself for two weeks&#34;. I&#39;m afraid I take issue with this; that rather depends on your criteria for going into quarantine.\n - If you will only quarantine if you are proven sick, then yeah, it does nothing for you - *yet*. Testing is being scaled up in many countries, and in the future (while we&#39;re still dealing with this) having a warning might be a prompt to get tested and act based on it&#39;s result.\n - If you will quarantine if you&#39;ve had a warning - or perhaps a number of warnings - as you see it as your duty to prevent transmission even though you may or may not be infected, then maybe it&#39;s good enough now. Testing can catch up in time.\n The problem of false negatives - of contacts not being recorded - is not a problem in itself because that&#39;s the world we already live in. My concern, though, would be that people start to rely on the app, rather than continuing to keep their distance, wash their hands, and not touching their face.\n On problem of contact tracing (regardless of centralized or not) with Bluetooth or similar technology is that a malicious attacker with specialized radio equipment (think 500 meter instead of 5m, and think wardriving with radio signals from outside to inside a building) can make any group of people falsely believe that they are infected.\n For example, someone might just drive by a parliament building and send the members of parliament into voluntary home quarantine. This is possible with Bluetooth Beacons.\n Is my understanding correct? Let&#39;s say I own a restaurant and I want to shut down my competitor&#39;s restaurant. Or let&#39;s say I am a teenage kid and want to shut down my school. Or, let&#39;s say I am a US democrat and want to hurt the political activities of the republican party.\n I really don&#39;t know since I am not an expert, but I am wondering if such apps should be widely used.\n There is ways around every problem, i wonder why professionals are so quick to dismiss ideas completely because of minor hurdles..\n First of all you can definde logical sectors. You research in what possbile locations infection typically takes place. Then you can give an &#34;ID&#34; to these locations. (I dont want to go into technicals but for example QR Codes at store entrances and busses)\n Even if you only trace all public locations somebody has been to you have gained a lot.\n Another way to segment the problem is to use different modes, for home, outside, work etc.\n The limited testing capatibilities are exactly why an app would be helpful. You would know where to look without &#34;testing around&#34; cases.\n Of course there is other problems but there is also other solutions. You could develop cheap blue tooth transponders for rooms and vehicles for example.\n RE: &#34;My problem with contact tracing apps is that they have absolutely no value.&#34; Not true: they can improve reaction time, assuming the tools are use appropriately.\n  RE: &#34;To me, it&#39;s just techies doing techie things.&#34; Absolutely. This is a common problem: Americans in general, and techies in particular,  lovetechnical solutions, even if they don&#39;t make sense.\n  Alternative: If you want to avoid the issues in tracing and stop the spread of the disease, there is a simple, cost effective solution: 1. Assume that everyone outside your home is a potential carrier. 2. Assume that every surface you touch is potentially contaminated. (The only exception is a surface that you cleaned yourself -- recently.)\n Keep your distance. Wear a mask. Encourage others to wear one. If you touch an object or surface, wash your hands. You don&#39;t wait for an app to tell you that you might have been exposed. You don&#39;t rely on the person to self-isolate based on the app.\n One of the first rules of gun safety is this: assume that all guns are loaded. The only exception is a gun that you have unloaded yourself. Treat every gun that you handle as if it is loaded -- always. If you treat it with respect, you&#39;ll never have to say, &#34;I&#39;m sorry: I didn&#39;t know it was loaded.&#34;\n [My background in college was microbiology and biochemistry. I spent most of my early career working with scientists, where I regularly encountered hazardous materials.]\n The money spent on these dragnets for people&#39;s relationships (or better fascists&#39; wet dream) should better be spent by minifying surface conterminations and raising the sanitizing in the public space.\n Like: - having soap and sterilium dispensers in each and every public building, schools or toilet FOR FREE, and MQTT-driven &#34;refill needed&#34; and &#34;cleaning needed&#34; foot or ellbow operated buttons. AMZN should have a few from their shelved dash button project.\n  - changing the door opening programs for public means of transportation to open alway all doors to maximize air change and minimize door handle usage.\n    - use multilingual speech recognition in elevators (where you could for example say 5th floor, f\u00fcnfter stock, or the name of any tennant in the 5th floor)\n - also rotating heat exchangers with moisture/enthalpy recovery in modern skyscrapers should be a big no-no sanitationwise.\n One further problem I see (which could be included in the &#34;false&#34; positive area) is false assumptions, of where everybody has a smart phone, and where there&#39;s a permanent 1:1 relationship between the user and the technology. This is very much in the vein of &#34;you are your phone&#34; that&#39;s presumed with things like payment systems.\n This is a real blind spot for the people who advocate this kind of application of technology, including the people who are advocating for online voting. For people who live in that kind of environment, where they are never without their phones, and have apps for everything, COVID tracking, voting, purchasing, multi-factor authentication, and nearly anything else is just another app.\n However, there are plenty of people out there that don&#39;t use their phones that way. There&#39;s still lots of feature phones out there, that don&#39;t have the capacities of a smart phone, including ones that don&#39;t support wi-fi or LTE (or GPS). And there&#39;s also plenty of places where people may share phones. Plus, the issues of people who are in areas (often, but not always, ru\n For the technically adept who live on their smartphones, it&#39;s easy to dismiss the people who don&#39;t have similar technology and usage patterns as Luddites that &#34;can&#39;t get with the program&#34;, but like it or not, that kind of usage is far from universal, and widespread enough that I think the kind of monitoring proposed will have significant (and likely fatal) gaps in coverage.\n I&#39;m unconvinced that this is a problem that can be solved with this application of this technology.\n Assume you take the app out grocery shopping with you and it subsequently alerts you of a contact. What should you do? It&#39;s not accurate enough for you to quarantine yourself for two weeks. And without ubiquitous, cheap, fast, and accurate testing, you can&#39;t confirm the app&#39;s diagnosis. So the alert is useless.\n If you assume that all the app does is say &#34;you had a contact&#34;, then yes, in the absence of easy testing, it&#39;ll quickly feel pointless to people.\n But what if, on the other hand, the app says something like: &#34;Your phone registered proximity to someone who&#39;s known to be infected, at [this time], for [this long]. Please answer a few questions:  - Were you around other people, or by yourself?  - Were you wearing a mask?  - Did you spend time within 6 feet of anyone who was not wearing a mask?&#34;\n  Given this, the app could help the user make a reasonable decision about their risk level; should they seek a test, or isolate at home?\n If we&#39;re concerned about too many false positives, the multipliers can be brought down, so for example, brief encounters are low risk, and if you say you were wearing a mask, it&#39;s listed as very low risk. But there will still be cases where this kind of app gives you value, especially after we&#39;ve opened up a lot; for example, if you&#39;re in a coffee shop without a mask for 2 hours, and then you later get an alert that someone infected was near you  ...\n There are ongoing studies right now to verify the efficacy of contact tracing apps, and whether the contacts they register are inline with what we would consider &#34;dangerous&#34; contacts with a reasonably high probability of transmission (e.g. by EPFL in Switzerland). Maybe we should all calm down and wait for the results before we start yelling at each other, and making arguments based on on intuition and &#34;common sense.&#34;\n (Also, just to point that out as well, these apps don&#39;t have to be perfect. It&#39;s totally fine for them to have a high percentage of false positives and false negatives, as long as they overall have a measurable positive impact on the reproduction number. And since small changes in the reproduction number can have large effects, even an app that only works somewhat poorly could still make the difference between an infection getting out of hand, and being contained.)  ...\n One final point: many of these apps do not work in the way you think they work, and can not be used to track people&#39;s behavior. Might be worth looking into actual proposals for how these apps will work instead of calling people fascists without any evidence.\n My view of these tracking apps seems to be somewhat different than the ones posted above. Even if there are tech problems with the apps; even if a lot of folks will not pay attention to the results; even if there are multitudes of false positive/negative results; if even one human life is saved, then it will benefit the future.\n Imagine that if one life saved is the future parent or grand-parent of the next Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, Jonas Salk, or Richard Feynman.\n Assume you take the app out grocery shopping with you and it subsequently alerts you of a contact. What should you do? It&#39;s not accurate enough for you to quarantine yourself for two weeks.\n Whether or not it&#39;s accurate, one might be concerned that the government would find out and order a quarantine. This is one of many reasons why people may avoid using the app (even if they have the technical capability to run it) which could make the false-negatives a self-reinforcing problem.\n If you can get clusters of people to use it, say everyone in a big office building, it&#39;s a lot easier to hit that 20-60% number than in the population as a whole.\n IMO these apps will be most useful as a tool to assist manual contact tracing teams at first.\n That&#39;s an overly simplistic analysis, that among other things only considers gross benefit rather than net benefit. I could just as easily say that the mental effects of pervasive surveillance could make &#34;the next Einstein&#34; turn away from physics. Maybe we&#39;d bring a deadly anti-government revolution into existence. These are all wild-ass guesses. Setting social policy based on evidenceless predictions is a fool&#39;s errand.\n Any &#34;if it only saves one life&#34; argument ignores the fact that there are trade-offs in all things. Everything has a cost and, scaled up to the world, it&#39;s not uncommon that that cost is greater than one life.\n Our rulers have been telling us nonstop for weeks that SARS-CoV-2 is so contagious that you can get it just from walking past someone on the sidewalk, and now we&#39;re all supposed to use &#34;contact tracing&#34; apps? Just who do they think they&#39;re kidding?\n This isn&#39;t a virus, it&#39;s a plot device in a badly written movie that does whatever the writer needs it to from one scene to the next without regard for logic or continuity.\n My understanding, is that the concept of &#34;contact tracing apps&#34; is not to  replace trained contact tracers, but rather to increase the amount of work they can accomplish in each day.\n  Perhaps at least one Asian country has already tried it, and the world can learn from their experience.\n I see that while I was editing this, Dan G made the same point more succinctly :)\n  Although there has been very much discussion of the possibility of transmission via surfaces, doctors just aren&#39;t seeing it. It appears (from real-life tracing of how people became infected) that almost all transmissions are to people who were within 2 meters of an infected person for more than 10 or 15 minutes.\n No technique will catch 100% of anything. That&#39;s not necessary, for it to be useful.\n    Some countries may achieve eradication within their borders ... but until vaccine eradication becomes possible, they would have to keep their travel barriers up high, and pay the price for that, permanently.\n Even with such barriers in place, these countries will have the reality that leakage can&#39;t reliably be forced to zero, and therefore be ready with Test/Trace/Isolate responses whenever a new case appears.\n Might be worth looking into actual proposals for how these apps will work instead of calling people fascists without any evidence. I called nobody a fascist. I called the system a fascist&#39;s wet dream.\n Somebody creates a system with the best intentions. Governments changes, systems stay, rules change... what do you do, if the next government misuses your system?\n And it will be misused at some point in time, because a pile of data invites misuse - just like trash attracts rats and left over french fires attracts raccoons. The best way ist to not collect possibly dangerous data at all.\n I showed up ways to lower the reproduction number of COVID-19 (and by the way other viruses and bacteria in the same effort). More sustainable, broader in effect, even accessible to people without smartphones, money, lobby and support (the working poor, and the really poor - these have been the substrate on which COVID19 grew in Singapore).\n With each and every such data collection system (and set of laws coming with it), please ask yourself: what could the next (possibly dystropean, stupid, extremist) government or junta do with it, should the country fails, elects an extremist party, breaks apart in a civil war, etc?\n If you introduce a situation where somebody can say &#34;the system said so&#34; and confine or even deport you &#34;for medical reasons&#34; *and everybody copes with it*, the temptation to just emulate &#34;is infected&#34;-events to get rid of &#34;the other side&#34; will grow fast. Not even the workers for this system would know that they deport or confine for political reasons, they just do their work.\n Maybe you should read up about the first &#34;big data&#34; application (made with punch cards and hollerith machines back in the day): the field &#34;religion&#34; in the dutch census database before 1933. Introduced with the best intentions (to calculate church taxes correctly and fast) the occupying germans said thank you, and used this information to pick up and deport the jews. Greetings from Anne F.\n Now sit down and make a list of what can be done under the worst circumstances with your proposed system and all data in it if NOT in the hands of St Lucas and used for the greater good of all human beings, but in the greedy claws of Kim Abu Adolpho Jean-Bedel al-Teherani from Somedistantholestan, if he wishes to divide and opress his subordinates.\n I&#39;m not sure whether the terms of &#39;false positives&#39; and &#39;false negatives&#39; apply here. It is not a test. It is about creating a contact list. And yes, it will not be perfect\n  Anyone who wants to understand the purpose of such tools, can consider the real-life example of crime investigators looking at the telephone records of a suspect.\n Will all of the calls on the phone log be related to the crime? Well duh, no! Of course not.\n Could there have been other conversations related to the crime that don&#39;t show in the phone log? Well duh, yeah! Of course.\n Despite these limitations, review of phone logs has enabled investigators to exclude or confirm suspects. It&#39;s a data source, NOT a diagnostic.\n False positives: Any app will have a precise definition of a contact: let&#39;s say it&#39;s less than six feet for more than ten minutes.\n They&#39;re Mormons. Caffeinated beverages are a sin. You&#39;re considered &#34;engaged&#34; if you stop to have a 10-minute conversation with some guy at a coffee shop. You&#39;re then obligated to have sex with him and make it right in the eyes of God. Those men are very suave, wear a certain kind of underwear, and maintain certain very proper and old-fashioned protocols and expectations of appropriate &#34;social distancing&#34; for a man&#39;s soon-to-be-carnal  ...\n This is a &#39;dumb&#39; take. The idea that contact tracing can be done with &#34;human health professionals&#34; is &#34;just plain dumb&#34;. The performance of human health professionals will also result in false positives and false negatives. What&#39;s the evidence that those rates are significantly better than an app?\n The smart take would realize that the choice isn&#39;t  betweenapps and &#39;professionals&#39; \u2013they could and should be used together. Without an app like what&#39;s being discussed, how would any professionals be able to trace a person&#39;s contacts, e.g. at a grocery store? Maybe the transmission of some other disease could be traced by, e.g. reviewing security camera videos at a number of stores, but this disease doesn&#39;t seem likely to be contained  ...\n The better way to interpret  any contact tracing, either by app or &#39;professional&#39;, is not as a binary &#39;infected&#39; or &#39;not infected&#39; judgement but as  evidenceto be weighed by such factors as false positives, false negatives, or other (approximately) measured biases in the different procedures. Yes, there would almost certainly be some threshold that, when exceeded, any contact tracing operation would suggest (or demand) that a person  ...\n Also, the idea that contact tracing could be performed, &#39;at scale&#39;, by what someone might reasonably consider to be a &#34;human health professional&#34; is also &#34;just plain dumb&#34;. The people likely to be involved in any large scale contact tracing effort are almost certainly not going to be doctors or nurses to any significant extent. They might be &#39;professionals&#39; because they&#39;re being paid but they&#39;re only &#39;health  ...\n I agree with Bruce on this. All the arguments that &#34;it doesn&#39;t need be perfect&#34;, and &#34;contact tracing app is a positive contribution even if only helps track down a small number of cases&#34;, miss the point.\n The true positive results will be drowned in false positives, which will divert precious resources into conducting useless activities, and creating unneeded stress in people.\n It will also lull people into a false sense of safety. &#34;Oh, the techies are looking out for us, we&#39;re good&#34;. And so there will be false negatives that could have been prevented or detected through more serious means.\n There are some food for thought videos on this site, unpacking \u201cR\u201d into causal factors, discussing transmissibility in terms of a statistical population of values rather than a point value, and referencing realistic models (e.g. modeling portal MIDAS.)\n The idea behind the APP is that you have ubiquitous, cheap, fast, and accurate testing. But App or not, we need massive testing to get back to or near to normal again.   https://paulromer.net/\n  The numbers don&#39;t add up for mathematical modeling on YouTube. AMS is too much the gentleman&#39;s club, and there are too many fashion models on the premises.\n Do you mean to include Australia? The Commonwealth Government sat on its hands in Jan, Feb and half way through March. It allowed thousands of infected people to come from overseas straight into the community.\n The social distancing rules and business closures have been imposed by the State Governments. States have closed their borders to other States. Contact tracing and testing has been done by the States.\n  This seems calculated to convince the community to live with the virus. Lots of copies have been downloaded. It beats me why people have so much faith in computer systems.\n My understanding is that the Prime Minister of the other antipodean nation to which you may be referring, New Zealand, did state an intention to eradicate the virus.\n I can see your assertion that what is required is tracking, tracing, testing and confining. However in my view a clear aim should also be stated, perhaps:\n  Communities should demand that their Governments ensure that each infected person infect on average less than one other person.\n Modern infectious diseases like coronavirus are the consequence of industrial civilization: technical developments enable the high density populations of modern cities and the ability for rapid mass travel.\n  If we look at the efficiency of modern medicine, it is in rapid decline because many of the innovations that allowed us to get here are over 100 years old: sanitation and hygeine (Ignaz Semmelweiss), painkillers and anesthetics, antibiotics (developed for about $40,000 in basic science research), and the vaccine.\n  Modern medicine -- like any industrial enterprise -- is characterized by diminishing returns. In this context, to expect technology to save us from coronavirus is not rational. There are no technical solutions to the problems caused by too much technology.\n The solutions here are in the policy realm: a comprehensive system of social insurance so that the sick can get treated and national resources can be rapidly mobilized in an emergency; and, alongside this, a guaranteed minimum income so that those who are ill can stay at home without risking infecting others but can maintain their ability to participate in the economy.\n A starting point for the latter policy direction might be John Kenneth Galbraith&#39;s &#34;cyclically graduated compensation,&#34; which ties unemployment benefits to the unemployment rate. When unemployment is low, benefits are just enough to get by; when unemployment is high, benefits are competitive with wages. This eliminates the incentive to idleness and prevents recessions from driving down wages, all while preserving aggregate demand  ...\n It&#39;s voluntary to carry the app, then when it informs of a possible contact it&#39;s voluntary to get tested. Excuse me, what&#39;s the point? Just so Silicon Valley can be seen to be doing something, anything\u2026\n The ugly point hidden so far is the monetization. It&#39;s beyond belief this app is given away in altruism.\n Maybe voluntary in one direction. If a test is what I wanted, it wouldn&#39;t be so easy to volunteer. My city has one testing center, a 4 hour walk from me, and if I thought I could walk or bike that distance there&#39;d be no reason to. It wouldn&#39;t exactly be a great idea to take a bus or taxi there. If I solved that problem, I still wouldn&#39;t be able to be tested, because it&#39;s only open to critical workers and their families, people  ...\n The tests need to be abundant and  accessible. These app makers would do more good by making an app that helped get people to tests, or tests to people. Health officials all praise testing, but much of the world seem to be dragging their feet on it. Stories abound of people who maybe once had COVID and don&#39;t expect to ever know.\n Contact tracking apps can be viewed as crude virus infection proxies. They imitate (with some degree of fidelity) the spreading mechanism of a generic virus.\n They proxy only the physical locality aspect of a virus infection opportunity. All other aspects are treated as if they were operating at 100% effectiveness.\n If widely enough adopted, they might provide insight into how the population is really interacting with itself. This in turn used with recorded cases and fatalities might help estimate the unknow infection rate.\n When infections are on the rise, we currently need to put 100% of the population into lockdown, i.e. a light to moderate quarantine. A widely used contact tracing app would allow us to only put those into quarantine who have had exposure. We might achieve half the efficacy of a total lockdown by merely quarantining 5% of the population. The rate of false positives hardly matters for this use-case, in some situations 99.9% could be acceptable.  ...\n Like brute forcing a password each char is exponential, a computer can do it but manual testing can&#39;t, you need 95% accurate tests.\n Probably pointless when you don&#39;t give your citizens proper welfare or source of income to be able to hunker down, they are going to revolt, or have to queue for food etc.\n The arguments about surface transmission, it&#39;s purely how well behaved your population is, social distancing and hand hygiene works. All you are doing with this argument is saying we&#39;ll all suffer the lowest common denominator.\n &#34;you can&#39;t expect people to isolate for 2 weeks if they get a false positive&#34; - social distancing and hygiene applies to households, households with positive cases still have family members living in them that are not catching it with proper protocols.\n So yes, it&#39;s easily defeated, but where you have a good uptake of proper behavior, where contact tracing and hygiene has already been successful, it makes that process much more thorough and faster if there is any more outbreaks of community transmission. Every contact will be tested.\n The wild card at the end of any theory is peoples behavior and the ugly truth is that&#39;s why some countries are doing better than others.\n Chinese Researchers fitst pointed out that something like 6% of those infected do not &#34;seroconvert&#34; (produce antibodies).\n The WHO later warned of this but frustratingly just said &#34;many&#34; not a range of percentages.\n But it&#39;s not just the seroconvertion issue, others are starting to say that in some the antibodies die back quickly --as little as two-four weeks, hence they can be reinfected in a very short time.\n Others think that the virus might hide in the body out of the circulatory system where our blood tests will not spot it. Thus it can come back with a vengence if those people are subject to stress.\n Such issues is confirmed by research could make a nonsense of &#34;back to work testing&#34;...\n But there are issues as I&#39;ve pointed out to @Jane and @C above, but there is more peculiarities being detected.\n There is a paper that I&#39;ve yet to read in depth done in the UK that has a cohort of ~16k patients, that tested positive in the UK, which is about a third of the total recorded cases at the time.\n Off the top of my head 14% did not progress to hospital, of those that did something like 30% died.\n But more intetestingly of those in hospital who died ~60% were men. But only about half of those in hospital had recognisable comorbidities.\n Those that were hospitalised tended to &#34;group&#34; that is they shared symptoms with others but not others.\n This suggests there are &#34;types&#34; of infection or patient. Which is which is unclear currently, but this raises the flag that there might not be a &#34;one size fits all&#34; vaccine. Which effects not just efficacy but safety as well. That is a vaccine that is safe for one type might be quite unsafe for another group.\n I would like to interject a question of practicality into this very interesting discussion of opinion and theory. Earlier this week, Apple began rolling out a beta of iOS 13.5 that includes the Covid-19 Tracking capability, with the default being &#34;On&#34;, located under Settings/Privacy/Health.  Does this mean someones iPhone running iOS 13.5 Beta is now collecting and reporting contact information to Apple, or does this mean the feature  ...\n There is , i wonder why professionals are so quick to dismiss ideas completely because of minor hurdles..\n No there are not ways around every problem, you would know that if you have been a practicing professional engineer for any period of time.\n Your first limitvand theres nothing you can do about this is &#34;the laws of physics&#34;.\n This leads into another issue even when the laws of physics do alow it, existing systems may not be designed for such solutions to be possible.\n Which leads into another issue &#34;work factor -v- Power Consumption&#34; if the solution cuts battery life down to only an hour or two a day, people are either not going to carry their phone because it&#39;s on charge all the time or they are going to turn the phone off.\n Which leads into another issue, the application may well be a resource hog this slow other applications on a phone down to a crawl.\n But there is another issue are all phones going to be able to run both Bluetooth and WiFi, they do share the frequency spectrum so what was once usable WiFi gets jamed by all those bluetooth emiting phones...\n There are a number of other just technical not security issues but the above should make you realise that there is NOT &#34;ways around every problem&#34;, and they are NOT &#34;minor hurdles&#34;.\n  To me, it&#39;s just techies doing techie things because they don&#39;t know what else to do.\n  Like so many other &#34;techies&#34; they have little or no clue what they are doing, because their love of technology and thinking they look clever is a Dunning-Kruger problem. Of which we have hundreds of thousands of examples with the likes of IoT and many &#34;start up gizmos&#34; all going wrong at the simple technical levels, let alone the security levels that very very few have any experience what so ever.\n  We&#39;re putting millions of people into effective quarantine today. Even if this app has a rate of 50% false positives and we end up putting hundreds of thousands people into quarantine wrongfully it&#39;s a huge win for society overall.\n One final point: many of these apps do not work in the way you think they work, and can not be used to track people&#39;s behavior.\n  The location of your phone is known to many people and both the IC and LEO&#39;s can get it either by just &#34;snooping on the backbone&#34; or poping around with an NSL etc.\n  I just wish people would take this fact on board because it might tell you why some LEO&#39;s are going to have wet dreams over this technology.\n But it gets worse your phone has no idea if it&#39;s recording another mobile phone or a &#34;fixed position beacon&#34;. This alows your phone position to be worked out fairky accurately especially if the accelerometers in the phone are also enabled.\n But it gets worse if a Government insists that the DB&#39;s are stored centrally (France for instance) or accessable centrally than any anonymity in the system can be fairly easily unrolled...\n And these are just one or two of the more easily seen flaws in the system, there are others and no doubt many more will be found with the Standards, Protocols and Implementations.\n  Perfection is the enemy of good. The system isn\u2019t perfect but it is valuable.\n Your phone alerts you that someone you spent 18 minutes with at a coffee shop has tested positive. It recommends that you watch for symptoms and get tested.\n  A false negative is more risky because it may lead to a false sense of security as people go out convinced they don\u2019t have coronavirus. But they would do that anyway without the app.\n Other considerations aside, if this application requires electricity to work, that could be a show-stopper on Iphone, at least my Iphone. \ud83d\ude09\n An official with a Canadian public health authority I questioned said in manual contact tracing they are only interested in people who had CLOSE and PROLONGED contact with an infected person. So, I conclude, there&#39;s no need for an app to, say, collect the numbers of people you walk by on the street on in a supermarket. Also remember that manual tracing -- like an app -- only covers who you are in contact with, not what you touch.\n I have a better idea: make it a feature of Pok\u00e9mon. Ten million people will download it the first day, no questions asked.\n Contact tracing has a long history for STDs. STDs also have a medical solution. And for STDs the notion of a contact is nicely bounded.\n This bugger virus is not understood. It is interesting for an application to present a spaghetti map for others to map to if and only if the known positive Is in your cached weeks of stranger IDs matches.\n A virus transfer would look like any other interaction: hello Bob, drug sale, drug purchase, bum a cigarette, ask for directions, Time and space will have to be fuzzy for surface contact viral transfers.\n  The obvious is a test me notification icon. The number of triggered contacts is likely to be 20-200 times the number of positive tests. USA new cases yesterday 36,000 so ball park one million tests triggered a day.\n Speaking of ball park... model contact dynamics reported by such an application at a baseball or basketball game.\n Your phone alerts you that someone you spent 18 minutes with at a coffee shop has tested positive\n  Contact tracing has a long history for STDs. STDs also have a medical solution. And for STDs the notion of a contact is nicely bounded.\n Officially top secret, but an open secret, no doubt. The suave gentleman at the coffee shop, a.k.a. &#34;that guy,&#34; is simply  too entitled.\n Bread is said to leaven in 18 minutes, according to some of those Jewish rabbis.\n There was a certain worldly &#34;way of life&#34; at some of those coffee shops, which is no more, and cannot be.\n Social conversation cannot possibly spread disease more than mere physical proximity without the conversation and socialization.\n There is something more going on. It is the false expectation and assumption of more intimate contact at night to follow any sort of open conversation or talk by day.\n That&#39;s the Asian Yin\u2013Yang. There are Asian triads and wiseguys who rule the night life of the city in a strange and inconsistent reflection of day life.\n about your sentence: &#34;To me, it&#39;s just techies doing techie things because they don&#39;t know what else to do.&#34; I&#39;d have added &#34;to defeat the virus&#34; in the end.  Instead for other purposes at least some governments will enjoy to look into collected data.  https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/493\n   Allowed HTML: &lt;a href=&#34;URL&#34;&gt; \u2022 &lt;em&gt; &lt;cite&gt; &lt;i&gt; \u2022 &lt;strong&gt; &lt;b&gt; \u2022 &lt;sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt; \u2022 &lt;ul&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; \u2022 &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;pre&gt;", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:30", "tags": "\u7a0b\u5e8f,\u75c5\u6bd2,app,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,tracing", "title": "\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u63a5\u89e6\u8005\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f", "title_en": "Me on Covid-19 contact tracing apps", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/05/me_on_covad-19_.html", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u7a0b\u5e8f", "\u75c5\u6bd2", "app", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "tracing"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000304, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u53cc\u5b50\u5ea7\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5b83\u63a2\u7d22\u5730\u9f20\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u52aa\u529b\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u7684(\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u7684)\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u7684(\u4e0d\u53ef\u5426\u8ba4\u7684)\u9677\u9631\u3002\n\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6258\u7ba1Gemini\u7684\u5b98\u65b9\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u90a3\u4e9b\u60f3\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u4e2a\u4ebaGminispace(\u901a\u8fc7sftp\u7ba1\u7406)\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7edd\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5b50\u5ea7\u672c\u8eab\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u624d\u80fd\u8bbf\u95ee\u5b83\u3002\n\u5c11\u91cf\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5185\u5bb9\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u9762\u7684HTTPS\u6216\u901a\u8fc7Gopher\u83b7\u5f97\u3002", "note_en": "Gemini is a new, collaboratively designed internet protocol, which explores the space inbetween gopher and the web, striving to address (perceived) limitations of one while avoiding the (undeniable) pitfalls of the other.\n This server hosts the official specification and other documentation for Gemini, as well as offering free personal Geminispace (managed via  sftp) for those wanting to play with the protocol.

"note_en": "Java SE 13 (Sept 2019) introduced text blocks as a preview feature, aimed at reducing the pain of declaring and using multi-line string literals in Java. It was subsequently refined in a second preview, with minor changes, and is scheduled to become a permanent feature of the Java Language in Java SE 15(Sept 2020).\n  String literals in Java programs are not limited to short strings like &#34;yes&#34; and &#34;no&#34;; they often correspond to entire &#34;programs&#34; in structured languages such as HTML, SQL, XML, JSON, or even Java.\n  Text blocks are string literals that can comprise multiple lines of text\u00a0and uses triple quotes (&#34;&#34;&#34;) as its opening and closing delimiter.\n  A text block can be thought of as a  two dimensional\u00a0block of text embedded in a Java program.\n  Being able to preserve the two-dimensional structure of that embedded program, without having to muck it up with escape characters and other linguistic intrusions, is less error-prone and results in more readable programs.\n   In  Java Futures at QCon New York, Java Language Architect Brian Goetz took us on a whirlwind tour of some of the recent and future features in the Java Language. In this article, he dives into Text Blocks.\n Java SE 13 (Sept 2019) introduced   text blocks as a  preview feature, aimed at reducing the pain of declaring and using multi-line string literals in Java.\n  It was subsequently refined in a  second preview, with minor changes, and is scheduled to become a  permanent feature of the Java Language in Java SE 15(Sept 2020).\n Text blocks are string literals that can comprise multiple lines of text. A text block looks like:\n  In this simple example, the variable  address will contain a two-line string, with line terminators after each line. Without text blocks, we would have to have written:\n String address = &#34;25 Main Street\\n&#34; + &#34;Anytown, USA, 12345\\n&#34;;orString address = &#34;25 Main Street\\nAnytown, USA, 12345\\n&#34;;\n As every Java developer already knows, these alternatives are cumbersome to write. But, more importantly, they are also more  error-prone (it&#39;s easy to forget a  \\n and not realize it), and more  difficult to read(because the language syntax is intermixed with the contents of the string). Since a text block is usually free of escape characters and other linguistic interruptions, it lets the language get out of the way so it is easier for readers to see the contents of the  ...\n The most commonly escaped character in string literals is newline ( \\n), and text blocks eliminate the need for these by allowing multi-line strings to be expressed directly. After newline, the next most commonly escaped character is double quote ( \\&#34;), which must be escaped because it conflicts with the string literal delimiter. Text blocks eliminate the need for these as well, because a single quote does not conflict with the triple-quote text block delimiter.\n  One might think that this feature would have been called &#34;multi-line string literals&#34; (and, probably, that&#39;s what a lot of people will call it.) But, we chose a different name,  text blocks, to highlight the fact that a text block is not merely an unrelated collection of lines, but instead better thought of as a  two-dimensional block of textthat is embedded in a Java program. To illustrate what we mean by &#34;two-dimensional&#34;, let&#39;s take a slightly more  ...\n  What does the author expect this to print? While we can&#39;t read their minds, it seems unlikely that the intent was that the XML block should be indented by 21 spaces; it is far more likely that these 21 spaces are there solely to line up the text block with the surrounding code. On the other hand, it is almost certainly the author&#39;s intent that the second line of output should be indented by four more spaces than the first. Further, even if the author did want exactly  ...\n From this example, we can see that the natural indentation of a block of a multi-line block of text embedded in our program source derives both from the desired relative indentation between the lines of the block, and from the relative indentation between the block and the surrounding code. We want our string literals to line up with our code (because they would look out of place if they didn&#39;t), and we want the lines of our string literals to reflect the relative indentation  ...\n One way to address this problem is with a library method we can apply to multi-line string literals, such as Kotlin&#39;s   trimIndent method, and Java indeed does provide such a method:   String::stripIndent. But because this is such a common problem, Java goes farther, automatically stripping the incidental indentation at compile time.\n To disentangle the incidental and essential indentation, we can imagine drawing the smallest possible rectangle around the XML snippet that contains the entire snippet, and treating the contents of this rectangle as a two-dimensional block of text. This &#34;magic rectangle&#34; is the contents of the text block, and reflects the relative indentation between the lines of the block but ignores any indentation that is an artifact of how the program is indented.\n This &#34;magic rectangle&#34; analogy may help motivate how text blocks work, but the details are a little more subtle because we may want finer control over which indentation is deemed incidental vs essential. The balance of incidental vs essential indentation can be adjusted using the position of the trailing delimiter relative to the contents.\n  A text block uses triple-quotes ( &#34;&#34;&#34;) as its opening and closing delimiter, and the remainder of the line with the opening delimiter must be blank. The content of the text block begins on the next line, and continues up until the closing delimiter. The compile-time processing of the block&#39;s contents has three phases:\n Line terminators are normalized. All line terminators are replaced by with the LF ( \\u000A) character. This prevents the value of a text block from being silently affected by the newline conventions of whatever platform the code was last edited on. (Windows uses  CR +  LF to terminate lines; Unix systems use  LF only, and there are even  other schemes in use as well.)\n  Incidental leading white space, and all trailing white space, is removed from each line. Incidental white space is determined as follows:\t Compute a set of  determining lines, which are all the non-blank lines of the result of the previous step, as well as the last line (the line that contains the closing delimiter) even if it is blank;\n  Escape sequences in the content are interpreted. Text blocks use the same set of escape sequences as do string and character literals. Performing these last means that escapes like  \\n,  \\t,  \\s, and  \\&lt;eol&gt; do not affect the whitespace processing. (Two new escape sequences have been added to the set as part of  JEP 368;  \\s for an explicit space, and  \\&lt;eol&gt; as a continuation indicator.)\n In our XML example, all the whitespace would be removed from the first and last line, and the middle two lines would be indented by four spaces, because there are five determining lines in this example -- the four lines containing XML code and the line containing the closing delimiter -- and the lines are all indented by at least as much whitespace as the first line of content. Often enough, this indentation is what is expected, but sometimes we might not want to  ...\n  Because the last line is also a determining line, the common whitespace prefix is now the amount of whitespace before the closing delimiter in the last line of the block, and this is the amount that is removed from each line, leaving the whole block indented by four. We could also manage the indentation programmatically, via the instance method   String::indent), which takes a multi-line string (whether it comes from a text block or not), and indents every line by  ...\n  In the extreme case, if no whitespace stripping is desired, the closing delimiter could be moved all the way back to the left margin:\n  Alternately, we could achieve the same effect by moving the entire body of the text block back to the margin:\n  These rules may sound somewhat complicated at first, but the rules were chosen to balance the various competing concerns of wanting to be able to indent the text block relative to the surrounding program while not generating variable amounts of incidental leading whitespace, and providing an easy way to adjust or opt out of whitespace stripping if the default algorithm is not what is wanted.\n  Java&#39;s string literals do not support interpolation of expressions, as some other languages do; text blocks do not either. (To the extent that we may consider this feature at some point in the future, it would not be specific to text blocks, but applied equally to string literals.) Historically, parameterized string expressions were built with ordinary string concatenation ( +); in Java 5,  String::formatwas added to support &#34;printf&#34; style string formatting.  ...\n Because of the global analysis surrounding whitespace, getting the indentation right when combining text blocks with string concatenation can be tricky. But, a text block evaluates to an ordinary string, so we can still use  String::format to parameterize the string expression. Additionally, we can use the new  String::formatted method, which is an instance version of  String::format:\n  (Unfortunately, this method could not also be called  format because we cannot overload static and instance methods with the same name and parameter lists.\n  While string literals are, in some sense, a &#34;trivial&#34; feature, they are used frequently enough that small irritations can add up. So it should be no surprise that the lack of multi-line strings has been one of the most common complaints about Java in recent years, and that many other languages have multiple forms of string literals to support different use cases.\n What may be surprising is the number of different ways that such a feature is expressed in popular languages. It&#39;s easy to say &#34;we want multi-line strings&#34;, but when we survey other languages, we find a surprisingly diverse range of approaches in both syntax and goals. (And, of course, a comparably broad range of developer opinions about the &#34;right&#34; way to do it.) While no two languages are the same, for most features that are common to  ...\n The following table shows (some of) the options for string literals in various languages. In each, the  ... is considered the content of the string literal, which may or may not be processed for escape sequences and embedded interpolations,  xxx represents a user-chosen nonce that is guaranteed to not conflict with the contents of the string, and  ## represents a variable number of  # symbols (which may be zero.)\n   esc. Some degree of escape sequence processing, where escapes are usually derived from the C style (e.g.,  \\n);\n      here. A &#34;here-doc&#34;, where the following lines, up until a line that contains only the user-selected nonce, are treated as the body of the string literal.\n  prefix. The prefix form is valid with all the other forms of string literals, and have been omitted for brevity.\n  delim. The delimiter is customizable to some degree, whether by inclusion of a nonce (C++), a varying number of  # characters (Rust, Swift), or swapping curly braces for other matched brackets (Ruby).\n While this table gives a flavor for the diversity in approaches to string literals, it really only scratches the surface, as the variety of subtleties in how languages interpret string literals are too varied to be captured in such a simple form. While most languages use an escape language inspired by C, they vary in exactly what escapes they support, whether and how they support unicode escapes (e.g.,  \\unnnn), and whether forms that don&#39;t support  ...\n The most obvious axis of variation across languages is the choice of delimiters, and how different delimiters signal different forms of string literals (with or without escapes, single or multiple lines, with or without interpolation, choice of character encodings, etc.) But reading between the lines, we can see how these syntactic choices often reflect philosophical differences about language design -- how to balance the various goals such as simplicity,  ...\n Not surprisingly, the scripting languages (bash, Perl, Ruby, Python) have made &#34;user choice&#34; their first priority, with many forms of literals which may vary in non-orthogonal ways (and often, multiple ways to express the same thing.) But in general, languages are all over the map in how they encourage users to think about string literals, how many forms they expose, and how orthogonal those forms are. We also see several philosophies about strings  ...\n Despite the range of approaches and opinions, from the perspective of balancing principled design with expressiveness, there is a clear &#34;winner&#34; from this survey:  Swift. It manages to support escaping, interpolating, and true raw-ness with a single, flexible mechanism (in both single- and multi-line variants.) It should not be surprising that the newest language in the group has the cleanest story, as it had the benefit of hindsight and could  ...\n  Text blocks were not the first iteration of this feature; the first iteration was   raw string literals. Like Rust&#39;s raw strings, it used a variable-sized delimiter (any number of backtick characters) and didn&#39;t interpret the contents at all. This proposal was withdrawn after it was fully designed and prototyped, as it was judged that, while it was sound enough, felt too &#34;nailed on the side&#34; -- it had too little common with traditional  ...\n One major objection to the JEP 326 approach is that raw strings worked differently in every way from traditional string literals; different delimiter characters, varying vs fixed delimiters, single- vs multi-line, escaping vs non-escaping. Invariably, someone is going to want some different combination of choices, and there will be calls for more different forms, leading us down the road that Bash took. On top of that, it didn&#39;t do anything to  ...\n  Jim Laskey and Stuart Marks, of the Java team at Oracle, have published a  programmer&#39;s guide outlining the details, and style recommendations, for text blocks.\n Use text blocks when it improves the clarity of code.Concatenation, escaped newlines, and escaped quote delimiters obfuscate the contents of a string literal; text blocks get &#34;out of the way&#34; so the contents are more obvious, but they are syntactically heavier than traditional string literals. Use them where the benefits pay for the extra costs; if a string fits on a single line and has no escaped newlines, it is probably best to stick with  ...\n Avoid in-line text blocks within complex expressions. While text blocks are string-valued expressions, and therefore can be used anywhere a string is expected, it is not always best to nest text blocks within complex expressions; it is sometimes better to pull it out into a separate variable. In the following example, the text block breaks up the flow of the code when reading, forcing readers to mentally switch gears:\n String poem = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(&#34;jabberwocky.txt&#34;)));String middleVerses = Pattern.compile(&#34;\\\\n\\\\n&#34;) .splitAsStream(poem) .match(verse -&gt; !&#34;&#34;&#34; \u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. &#34;&#34;&#34;.equals(verse)) .collect(Collectors.joining(&#34;\\n\\n&#34;));\n If we pull the text block into its own variable, it is easier for readers to follow the flow of the computation:\n String firstLastVerse = &#34;&#34;&#34; \u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. &#34;&#34;&#34;;String poem = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(&#34;jabberwocky.txt&#34;)));String middleVerses = Pattern.compile(&#34;\\\\n\\\\n&#34;) .splitAsStream(poem) .match(verse -&gt; !firstLastVerse.equals(verse)) .collect(Collectors.joining(&#34;\\n\\n&#34;));\n Avoid mixing spaces and tabs in the indentation of a text block. The algorithm for stripping incidental indentation computes a common whitespace prefix, and therefore will still work if lines are  consistently indented with a combination of spaces and tabs. However, this is obviously brittle and error-prone, so it is best to avoid mixing them -- use one or the other.\n Align text blocks with the neighboring Java code. Since incidental whitespace is automatically stripped, we should take advantage of this to make code easier to read. While we might be tempted to write:\n void printPoem() { String poem = &#34;&#34;&#34;\u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy tovesDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;All mimsy were the borogoves,And the mome raths outgrabe.&#34;&#34;&#34;; System.out.print(poem);\n because we don&#39;t want any leading indentation in our strings, most of the time we should write:\n void printPoem() { String poem = &#34;&#34;&#34; \u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. &#34;&#34;&#34;; System.out.print(poem);}\n  Don&#39;t feel obligated to line up the text with the opening delimiter. We can choose to line up the text block contents with the opening delimiter:\n String poem = &#34;&#34;&#34; \u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. &#34;&#34;&#34;;\n This might seem attractive, but can be cumbersome if the lines are long or the delimiter starts far to the left margin, because now the text will be sticking all the way into the right margin. But this form of indentation isn&#39;t required; we can use any continuation indentation, as long as we do so consistently:\n String poem = &#34;&#34;&#34; \u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. &#34;&#34;&#34;;\n When a text block contains an embedded triple quote, only escape the first quote. While it is allowable to escape every quote, it is not necessary, and interferes needlessly with readability; escaping only the first quote is needed:\n String code = &#34;&#34;&#34; String source = \\&#34;&#34;&#34; String message = &#34;Hello, World!&#34;; System.out.println(message); \\&#34;&#34;&#34;; &#34;&#34;&#34;;\n Consider splitting very long lines with \\. Along with text blocks, we get two new escape sequences,  \\s (for a literal space) and  \\&lt;newline&gt; (a continuation line indicator.) If we have literals with very long lines, we can use  \\&lt;newline&gt; to put a line break in the source code but which is removed during the compile-time escape processing of the string.\n  String literals in Java programs are not limited to short strings like  &#34;yes&#34; and  &#34;no&#34;; they often correspond to entire &#34;programs&#34; in structured languages such as HTML, SQL, XML, JSON, or even Java. Being able to preserve the two-dimensional structure of that embedded program, without having to muck it up with escape characters and other linguistic intrusions, is less error-prone and results in more readable  ...\n  Brian Goetz\u00a0is the Java Language Architect at Oracle, and was the specification lead for JSR-335 (Lambda Expressions for the Java Programming Language.)

"note_en": "We are excited to announce that the Rust/WinRT project finally has a permanent and public home on GitHub:\n  Rust/WinRT follows in the tradition established by  C++/WinRT of building language projections for the Windows Runtime using standard languages and compilers, providing a natural and idiomatic way for Rust developers to call Windows APIs. Rust/WinRT lets you call any WinRT API past, present, and future using code generated on the fly directly from the metadata describing the API and right into your Rust package where you can call them as if they were just another Rust module.\n The Windows Runtime is based on Component Object Model (COM) APIs under the hood and is designed to be accessed through language projections like C++/WinRT and Rust/WinRT. Those language projections take the metadata describing various APIs and provide natural bindings for the target programming language. As you can imagine, this allows developers to more easily build apps and components for Windows using their desired language. You can then use those Windows APIs to build desktop apps, store  ...\n Microsoft has long depended on C++ as the backbone for so much of what we do, but it has some challenges particularly when it comes to security. Modern C++ certainly makes it easier to write safe and secure C++ if you follow certain careful conventions, but that is often hard to enforce on larger projects. Rust is an intriguing language. It closely resembles C++ in many ways, hitting all the right notes when it comes to compilation, runtime model, type system and deterministic finalization.  ...\n Here below is a simple example of Rust calling a Windows API. The API itself does not matter, but it should give you a sense for how naturally Windows APIs may be called from Rust code. In the following example, we are using the XmlDocument class from the Windows.Data.Xml.Dom namespace to parse and inspect a simple XML document:\n  If you are familiar with Rust, you will notice this looks far more like Rust than it looks like C++ or C#. Notice the snake_case on module and method names and the ? operator for error propagation.\n Here is another example using the Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer namespace to copy some value onto the clipboard:\n  For a more complete example, I encourage you to have a look at Robert Mikhayelyan\u2019s Minesweeper demo. Robert originally wrote a version of the classic game using C++/WinRT and was able to quickly port it over to using Rust/WinRT.  https://github.com/robmikh/minesweeper-rs\n This is a very early public preview, but we have decided to work in the open from here on out. So please give it a try and let us know what you think. We would love the feedback as we continue to develop Rust/WinRT and plan to eventually publish on crates.io. We also hope to provide more seamless interop with existing Win32 and COM APIs including support for  the com-rs crate, which supports COM APIs today.  https://github.com/microsoft/winrt-rs", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:19", "tags": "rust,winrt", "title": "Rust/WinRT\u516c\u5171\u9884\u89c8", "title_en": "Rust/WinRT Public Preview", "transed": 0, "url": "https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/04/30/rust-winrt-public-preview/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["rust", "winrt"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000300, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u9009\u62e9\u6b64\u9009\u9879\u5c06\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u53d1\u5e03\u8005/\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u6240\u6709\u53d1\u5e03", "note_en": "Selecting this option will search all publications for the Publisher/Society in context", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:16", "tags": "\u514d\u8d39,\u63d0\u4f9b,today,\u9009\u9879,option", "title": "\u300a\u4eca\u65e5\u7269\u7406\u300b\u6682\u65f6\u514d\u8d39\u63d0\u4f9b\u5176\u6863\u6848", "title_en": "Physics Today is temporarily making its archive freely available", "transed": 0, "url": "https://physicstoday.scitation.org/journal/pto", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u514d\u8d39", "\u63d0\u4f9b", "today", "\u9009\u9879", "option"]}]
