Capital", "note_en": "The Bitfinex crypto exchange is making a new push to find and potentially recover more than $800 million in user funds seized by legal authorities in four different countries after its payment processor\u2019s bank accounts were frozen.\n iFinex Inc., Bitfinex&#39;s parent firm, applied for subpoenas in Colorado, Arizona and Georgia this month, asking federal courts to aid it in deposing banks that may have held funds for Crypto Capital, the payment processor on which Bitfinex stored customers\u2019 and exchange funds.\n An entity hoping to confirm bank records can apply for a subpoena as banks cannot usually share those documents without a court order.\n iFinex applied for a subpoena Tuesday to depose  SunTrust Bank employees in Georgia. This follows a similar subpoena application to depose the  Bank of Colorado earlier in April and  ABT &amp; Trust in Arizona. Bitfinex is looking for evidence to support its legal claims to about $880 million held in bank accounts in Poland, Lisbon, London and elsewhere that have been seized by authorities pursuing anti-money laundering criminal charges against Crypto Capital.\n Bitfinex\u2019s application follows  an initial subpoena request from October 2019, filed in California, where the exchange sought testimony from a former TCA Bancorp executive about Crypto Capital\u2019s accounts. This subpoena  was later granted. A federal judge  likewise granted iFinex&#39;s application in Arizona, while a magistrate judge in Georgia asked the company to  file a corporate disclosure statement first.\n \u201cCrypto Capital used a bank account with Citibank, N.A. (\u2018Citibank\u2019) to accept certain deposits from Applicant\u2019s customers. The account was held in the name of \u2018Global Trading Solutions, LLC,\u2019\u201d the filing in Arizona stated.\n  Bitfinex General Counsel Stuart Hoegner told CoinDesk the filings \u201care aimed squarely at obtaining further information\u201d about the funds held by Crypto Capital.\n \u201cAs we have said before, Bitfinex is the victim of a fraud and is asserting its rights to funds taken by Crypto Capital through legal measures initiated in various countries,\u201d he said through a spokesperson.\n  Bitfinex and its sister firm, stablecoin operator Tether, are the subject of civil lawsuits and an investigation by the  New York Attorney General&#39;s office alleging fraud and market manipulation.\n Tether has denied the allegations in  public statements. It has also aggressively issued more tether (USDT) since the investigation began; about $80 million in new USDT virtual currency  on Thursday alone. This raises the presumed market value of the currency to about $8 billion, an increase of about $2 billion over the last 40 days, according to the Whale Alert tracking service.\n \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at big tether issuances like that, you should look at how other currencies are acting in the market,\u201d said Bennett Tomlin, a bitcoin writer and researcher who has been following the case closely. \u201cThe other stablecoins don\u2019t seem to have the same kind of inflows. And you will very rarely see tether redemptions. It almost always goes up. Because we know from their lawyers that  it\u2019s not fully backed, I\u2019m generally skeptical of larger issuances of tether.\u201d\n Bitfinex began to rely on Crypto Capital as other banking relationships deteriorated, the firm said in the Georgia filing. Banks have grown wary of facilitating trade in cryptocurrency for fear of running afoul of cross-border money laundering laws.\n However, the president of Crypto Capital, Ivan Manuel Molina Lee,  was arrested by Polish authorities in October and charged with being a member of an international gang laundering up to 1.5 billion z\u0142oty or about $390 million \u201cfrom illegal sources.\u201d Authorities wrote that Molina Lee\u2019s crimes included \u201claundering dirty money for Columbian drug cartels using a cryptocurrency exchange.\u201d\n Federal prosecutors indicted a second principal of Crypto Capital, Oz Yosef, in October on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. Oz Yosef\u2019s sister, Ravid, was also indicted on fraud charges connected to Crypto Capital but remains at large in Israel.\n  Crypto Capital managed to stash Bitfinex reserves in banks across the world, according to Bitfinex \u2019s application. \u201cCrypto Capital subsequently transferred funds between and among various banks, including in Europe and the United States. In the U.S. alone, Applicant has information that Crypto Capital used accounts held not only at SunTrust, but also Bank of America, Bank of Colorado, Citibank, Enterprise Bank &amp; Trust, HSBC, Stearns Bank, Wells Fargo, TD Bank, and US Bank, \u201dBitfinex  ...\n  Bitfinex hopes to trace how Crypto Capital moved money from one bank account to another to bolster its ownership claims over funds once held by the processor, according to the filings. Doing so requires navigating the convoluted chain of account ownership, commingled funds and financial transfers Crypto Capital used to manage money, Bitfinex notes in the application.\n Polish banks held about $335 million in Bitfinex fiat currency reserves, while Portuguese banks held about another $218 million, according to the Georgia filing.\n Referring to  statements made by Giancarlo Devasini, Bitfinex \u2019s chief financial officer, the subpoena application said, \u201c[F]rom approximately April to June 2018, Crypto Capital used a bank account ending in -9503 with Citibank to accept deposits from Applicant \u2019s customers. The account was held in the name of Global Trading Solutions, LLC. Because the name of this LLC was similar to that of the entity that then owned Crypto Capital (Global Trade Solutions AG), Applicant believed  ...\n Global Trading Solutions LLC is owned by Reggie Fowler, a former National Football League investor tied to Crypto Capital. Fowler was  indicted one year ago on charges of bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n He  rejected a p l ea deal earlier this year; a trial scheduled to begin Tuesday has been pushed to Jan. 11, 2021. A Department of Justice spokesperson said he did not know if the delay is related to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting judicial schedules.\n Citibank in California told Bitfinex\u2019s legal team Fowler opened a separate, personal Citibank banking account at the same time and funded it with a $200,000 deposit from an unknown source and two subsequent wire transfers totaling $4 million. The wire transfers came from Banco BPI, one of three Portuguese banks Crypto Capital used for Bitfinex accounts.\n While Crypto Capital was taking transfers from Bitfinex into one Citibank account, Fowler transferred $380,000 from his account to a SunTrust account, according to the subpoena application.\n  Later, nearly $2 million of iFinex customer funds were transferred from the Citibank account to a Bank of Colorado account, Bitfinex said in the Colorado court filing.\n Citibank told Bitfinex that this Bank of Colorado account \u201cis held in the name of Eligibility Criterion, an entity owned or controlled by Fowler. Moreover, the wire transfer instructions indicated these transfers were \u2018Intercompany Transfers.\u2019\u201d according to the document.\n New York courts have enjoined the firms from further depleting their cash reserves and from transferring any of those cash reserves to company executives, and directed the firms\u2019 executives to produce documents and information central to the attorney general\u2019s investigation. The companies are fighting those disclosures in court, an act that the Attorney General\u2019s office described as \u201c deeply perverse.\u201d\n    The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a  strict set of editorial policies.

Earlier this week,  Deliveroo was reported to be cutting 367 jobs (and furloughing 50 more) from its workforce of 2,500. Others seem to be in similarly bleak positions \u2013  Uber is said to be discussing plans to let go around 20% of its workforce, some 5,400 roles. The broader UK start-up scene has asked for \u2013  and secured \u2013 government bailout funds.\n  Why Deliveroo is struggling during a crisis that should benefit its business model tells us about much more than just one start-up. The company\u2019s nominal reasoning for needing cuts is that coronavirus will be followed by an economic downturn, which could hit orders. That\u2019s plausible, but far from a given.\n The financial crash of 2008 \u2013 which led to the most severe recession since the Great Depression \u2013 saw \u201ccheap luxuries\u201d perform quite well. People would swap a restaurant meal for, say, a \u00a310 Marks &amp; Spencer meal deal. Deliveroo is far cheaper than a restaurant meal for many people \u2013 there\u2019s no need to pay for a childminder, or travel, and there\u2019s no need to purchase alcohol at restaurant prices. Why would Deliveroo be so certain a downturn would be bad news?\n The answer lies in the fact that Deliveroo\u2019s real business model has almost nothing to do with making money from delivering food. Like pretty much every other start-up of its sort, once you take all of the costs into account, Deliveroo loses money on every single delivery it makes, even after taking a big cut from the restaurant and a delivery fee from the customer. Uber, now more than a decade old, still loses money for every ride its service offers and every meal its couriers deliver.\n When every customer loses you money, it\u2019s not good news for your business if customer numbers stay solid or even increase, unless there\u2019s someone else who believes that\u2019s a good thing. What these companies rely on is telling a story \u2013 largely to people who will invest in them. Their narrative is they\u2019re \u201cdisrupting\u201d existing industries, will build huge market share and customer bases, and thus can\u2019t help but eventually become hugely profitable \u2013 just not yet.\n This is the entire venture capital model \u2013the financial model for Silicon Valley and the whole technology sector beyond it. Don \u2019t worry about growing slowly and sustainably, don \u2019t worry about profit, don \u2019t worry about consequences. Just go flat out, hell for leather, and get as big as you can as fast as you can. It doesn \u2019t matter than most companies will try and fail, provided a few succeed. Valuations will soar, the company will become publicly listed (a procedure known as an IPO) and  ...\n This is a whole business model based on optimism. Without that optimism, and the accompanying free-flowing money to power through astronomical losses, the entire system breaks down. That \u2019s the real struggle facing this type of company. It \u2019s also why the very idea of bailing out this sector should be a joke: venture capital chases returns of at 10 times their investment, on the basis that it \u2019s high risk and high reward. If we take out the element of \u201crisk \u201d, we \u2019re basically just funnelling  ...\n What pushes this beyond a tale that many of us might be happy to write down to karma, though, is the effects it has well beyond the rest of the world.\n  Tech giants move in on existing sectors that previously supported millions of jobs and helped people make their livelihoods \u2013 cabs and private hire, the restaurant business, to name just a few. They offer a new, subsidised alternative, that makes customers believe a service can be delivered much more cheaply, or that lets them cherry-pick from the restaurant experience \u2013 many restaurants relied on those alcohol sales with a meal to cover their margins, for example.\n These start-ups come in to existing sectors essentially offering customers free money: \u00a310 worth of stuff for a fiver. It turns out that \u2019s easy to sell. But in the process, they rip the core out of existing businesses and reshape whole sectors of the economy in their image. And now, in the face of a pandemic, they are starting to struggle just like everyone else. It \u2019s not hard to see how this sorry story ends. Having disrupted their industries to the point of leaving business after business  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-03 08:23:45", "tags": "\u98ce\u9669,poster,\u9910\u5385,restaurant", "title": "Deliveroo\u662f\u98ce\u9669\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u5178\u8303\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4e0d\u592a\u597d\u4e86", "title_en": "Deliveroo was the poster child for venture capitalism.

"note_en": "Sian-Pierre Regis, 35, is used to living with roommates. For the past 10 years, he has split the rent on his apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan with two (in some cases, three) friends. But in June, he\u2019s getting a co-tenant of a different sort: his 78-year-old mother, Rebecca Danigelis.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think either of us expected to be in this situation,\u201d said Mr. Regis, a freelance filmmaker. His mother worked for over 40 years as a hotel housekeeper, rising to a management position, until her job was abruptly eliminated three years ago.\n Since then, she has lived off her slim retirement savings (she liquidated most of her 401(k) to pay Mr. Regis\u2019s college tuition in 2002) and whatever part-time cleaning jobs she could find. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, she again was out of work, and at the end of May, the lease on her subsidized housing in Boston will expire. She can\u2019t afford the rent.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what she could have done better, or how she could have prevented this,\u201d Mr. Regis said. \u201cShe worked long hours, never called in sick and cleaned houses to make extra money when she wasn\u2019t at her hotel job. She had no vices.\u201d\n Still, as a single parent raising two children, she struggled to save. \u201cWhen she lost her job, she had $600 in her savings account,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had nothing to fall back on.\u201d\n Nothing except her son, that is. Which makes Mr. Regis one of the growing number of millennials who are supporting their parents financially and, in some cases, giving them a place to live. Known as the reverse-boomerang effect, the phenomenon of parents moving in with their adult children, often for financial reasons, is on the rise. According to a  Pew Research Center analysis of population data, 14 percent of adults living in someone else \u2019s home in 2017 were a parent of the head of household,  ...\n Expressed in starker terms, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has  predicted that half of today\u2019s workers will not have enough savings to sustain their standard of living when they retire. According to the AARP Public Policy Institute,  one in five Americans will be over the age of 65 by 2030 (compared with  one in seven in 2017), \u201cand our nation will face a severe shortage in accessible and affordable housing to meet their needs.\u201d\n  Enter the resurgence of multigenerational housing, when adults from at least two generations share the same home. After declining to its lowest point in 1980, multigenerational housing is now close to its 1950 peak, representing 20 percent of the total American population in 2016,  according to another Pew analysis.\n While that trend is largely driven by 20-somethings living with their middle-aged parents,  Pew researchers found that older adults were also significantly more likely to be living with their grown children in recent years than they were in the 1990s.\n Younger Americans should take this pattern seriously, says Georgia Lee Hussey, a financial planner in Portland, Ore., who has clients across the country. \u201cMost of my clients have at least one parent that needs to be factored into their financial plan,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s tricky is that for some families, it can be unexpected. Especially in white American culture, people over 60 are often uncomfortable talking about their finances, and ashamed to ask their children for help.\u201d\n And don\u2019t underestimate the power of denial. Ms. Hussey noted that many baby boomers watched their own parents enjoy an era of heartier pension plans and lower health care costs. Now, many Americans work hard all their lives but still don\u2019t have enough savings to retire. \u201cThen, suddenly their child realizes, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have to take care of dad,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt can lead to some incredibly difficult conversations.\u201d\n  For Dulcinea Myers-Newcomb, 45, that realization happened when her 80-year-old father came to visit her and her two children, ages 8 and 14, in Portland \u2014 and then never left. \u201cHe said, \u2018So, I\u2019m not really visiting. I live here now,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that my father did not ever plan for this phase in his life, but my husband and I were not prepared for him to move in as soon as he did.\u201d\n To make room for their new housemate, Ms. Myers-Newcomb, a real-estate agent, arranged to install what is known as an accessory dwelling unit \u2014a secondary apartment built on a single-family residential lot \u2014in their small backyard. But the price \u2014about $110,000 \u2014put the family in a tight spot. Like many Americans, she and her husband were already sandwiched between lingering student debt and trying to save for their own retirement. They took out a home equity line of credit to cover the  ...\n \u201cI hope my kids don\u2019t have to do this for me someday, but I think it\u2019s beautiful that our children see that we\u2019re taking care of our elders,\u201d Ms. Myers-Newcomb said. \u201cI\u2019m seeing it more and more in my work, too: people my age and younger taking in their parents.\u201d\n \u201cMy parents were pretty explicit that my siblings and I were their retirement plan,\u201d said Ka Po Lam, a 28-year-old treasury analyst who works for a bank in New York City. His family moved to the United States when he was a young boy, and he started giving half his take-home pay to his father at age 15, when he got his first job at McDonald\u2019s.\n \u201cBeing from Hong Kong, it\u2019s part of our culture to help the family,\u201d he said. \u201cAs immigrants, both my parents worked manual labor jobs. They don\u2019t get Social Security. The traditional ways to afford retirement aren\u2019t really available to them.\u201d\n  Mr. Lam now sends about $800 a month to his parents, who live with his older sister in Boston. \u201cI \u2019m basically paying double rent \u2014mine and my parents \u2019\u2014so I manage money pretty carefully, \u201dhe said. For a while, he had a second job at a coffee shop to earn extra cash on weekends \u2014a different lifestyle from most of his banker colleagues \u2019, but he \u2019s not complaining. \u201cIt \u2019s not something I hide, \u201dhe said. \u201cAs much of a burden as that can be, I find validation in the fact that I can  ...\n Still, financial responsibility for aging parents can be daunting no matter how much planning you do, said Athena Valentine Lent, 34, a program manager for a nonprofit in Phoenix, Ariz. \u201cI\u2019m Latina, and multigenerational households are normal in our culture,\u201d she said. \u201cI always knew my dad would come to live with me someday, and I\u2019ve worked hard to prepare, but it\u2019s still not easy.\u201d\n Although her father is only 53, she expects that a combination of his health and financial issues will put him on her doorstep within the next five years. \u201cI have a \u2018dad fund, \u2019and I put a couple hundred dollars a month in it, \u201dshe said. \u201cIt affects a lot of my life decisions. If my partner and I decide to buy a house, it will have to be big enough for my dad to live there with us. It \u2019s a lot to think about, especially since I \u2019d like to have children of my own in the next couple  ...\n To make matters more complicated, her father takes care of his mother, Ms. Lent\u2019s grandmother. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t just be taking care of him. I would also take in my grandma, and possibly my aunt too, because she also lives with them,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t just inherit our parents \u2014 we inherit entire families.\u201d\n These early reverse-boomerang pioneers are laying important groundwork, said Rodney Harrell, the vice president of family, home, and community at the AARP. \u201cAs it becomes more normalized for older adults to live with their grown children, I think it will get easier for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your neighbor builds an accessory dwelling unit, or has their parents living with them, you might realize it\u2019s a viable option for you and your family, too.\u201d\n That\u2019s certainly been the case for Mr. Regis. \u201cAt first, I felt really lost. My situation was foreign to my closest friends, the people I\u2019d gone to college with,\u201d he said. But when he made a documentary film about his mother\u2019s experience, \u201cDuty Free,\u201d the response was huge. \u201cWhen we released the trailer for the film, I heard from so many people, my own age and younger, who said, \u2018Thank you for making this. My mom just moved in with me, too, and I would do anything for her.\u2019\u201d\n He also sees a silver lining. \u201cIn our country, the elderly become invisible.

"note_en": "Our team,  DeisLabs, recently released a new piece of software called  Krustlet, which is a tool for running  WebAssembly modules on the popular, open-source container management tool called  Kubernetes. Kubernetes is used quite extensively to run cloud software across many vendors and companies and is primarily written in the  Go programming language. While there have been many stories about using Rust for systems level programming, you don\u2019t often hear stories about cloud software  orKubernetes software  ...\n  First off, let \u2019s start with some important context. WebAssembly (abbreviated as WASM) was originally designed to be run in browsers. WASM is a compiled binary that can be downloaded and run in any browser. This allows for performant applications to be run inside of a browser and is currently used in many major web applications. Recent work has enabled compiled WASM binaries (called modules) to be run on any system. Rust is one of the few languages with native build support for these binaries.  ...\n  The other reason we chose Rust was its strong safety and security guarantees. Like most Rust newbies, we started off cursing Rust \u2019s borrow checker (which statically enforces many of Rust \u2019s safety guarantees) and sometimes fighting with it for hours. But after we started to get a better understanding of how to code things, we realized how many bugs and problems the compiler was saving us from. It kept us from exposing possible null pointers, thread safety issues, and other overlooked bugs.  ...\n A concrete example of this is how the Rust compiler protected us from various concurrency bugs. Krustlet is responsible for running arbitrary numbers of WASM modules in parallel. As we wrote the code for managing the running modules, the borrow checker caught cases of us passing a data structure between threads that would have resulted in unsafe or concurrent data access problems. It also prevented us from using objects that could have already been accessed by previous parts of the code.\n Even though we sometimes miss having a garbage collector so we don\u2019t have to worry about cloning, borrowing, ownership, etc., the pain we have avoided because of the Rust compiler\u2019s strict rules is incalculable. For comparison, last week  we caught a significant race condition in another Kubernetes-related project we maintain called  Helm(written in Go) that has been there for a year or more, and which passed the race checker for Go. That error would never have escaped the Rust compiler, preventing  ...\n Because of the large amount of customization (at least in Kubernetes) with custom data types and the distributed nature of cloud computing, having these protections and safety guarantees at the compiler level gives us great confidence in the code we are writing. By no means does it eliminate all bugs, but it does help us avoid many of the common concurrency ones from the beginning. In addition, having a strong type system that still allows for extensibility (in the form of  traits, which the  ...\n In short, the flexibility, safety, and security of Rust outweighs any inconvenience of having to follow strict lifetime, borrowing, and other compiler rules or even the lack of a garbage collector. These features are a much-needed addition to cloud software projects and will help avoid many bugs commonly found in them.\n  Just because we love many things about Rust doesn\u2019t mean everything is rosy. We also learned of a few gotchas that we consider important to point out as you make the decision of whether to use Rust for a new cloud software project.\n One of the biggest ones to point out is that async runtimes are still a bit unclear. There are currently two different options to choose from, each of them with their own tradeoffs and problems. Also, many of the implementation details are tied to specific runtimes, meaning that if you have a dependency that uses one runtime over another, you \u2019ll often be locked into that runtime choice. Rust has made great progress in the past year with its async story, but there are still some issues  ...\n The other thing to watch out for is the learning curve. It takes several weeks of hard effort learning how to code properly in Rust before the learning curve levels out. However, that hard effort up front pays off in dividends due to the aforementioned safety features. We also noticed that once developers are over that initial curve, they are able to contribute to code just as easily as with any other language. Just be aware that there will be some initial pain.\n If you are willing to deal with these current problems, then there is no reason why you shouldn\u2019t at least consider using Rust for your next project. All languages have their tradeoffs, but we feel the benefits gained outweigh any of these pain points.\n  We see a bright future for Rust in cloud software. In the immediate future, we plan on continuing its use for any of our projects where it would be a good fit. Given the features Rust brings to the table, even with its lack of some familiar features (such as garbage collection), we highly recommend it as an option for your next cloud software project.",

coronavirus, according to a report on Wednesday.\n Dean Banks, president of Tyson Foods, said the company is working with Matrix Medical, a clinical services company, that will ensure coronavirus is not spreading in plants where it has been detected.\n &#34;That gives us the team that we need to come in and make sure that\u00a0we put food on the American table,&#34; Banks said on &#34;Fox &amp; Friends&#34; Friday morning.\n The Tyson plant\u00a0located in Logansport, Ind., has seen 890 of\u00a0its 2,200\u00a0employees test positive in just under a week -- more than 40 percent of its workforce. It&#39;s one of several Tyson plants across the country that have voluntarily closed due to virus outbreaks.\n  Cass County\u00a0officials have been working with Tyson, the largest U.S. meat supplier, in developing a plan to reopen,\u00a0according to Indianapolis&#39;s WISH-TV.\n   Cass County Commissioner Ryan Browning said that plan has been expedited after\u00a0President Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday, ensuring meat processing plants would stay open during the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic.\n The businesses are now declared as\u00a0\u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d\u00a0under the Defense Production Act.\n \u201cSo there is some worry there that might force them to flip a switch and go but we are continuing with our plan,\u201d Browning told the station.\n  Pork processing\u00a0offers workers little personal space, who typically work in a close-quarter environment, WISH-TV reported. The virus is known to spread from person-to-person\u00a0within six-feet, through respiratory droplets in the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n   \u201cWe\u2019ve been screening worker temperatures, requiring protective face coverings and conducting additional cleaning and sanitizing. We\u2019ve also implemented social distancing measures, such as workstation dividers and more breakroom space,&#34; it said, according to the  station.\n Health officials reported 1,283 coronavirus cases in the county as of Tuesday. The peak number of cases is expected to hit in the next two weeks.\n  Indiana has seen more than\u00a017,835 coronavirus cases and at least\u00a01,114 deaths from the virus, as of early Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 06:55:09", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u5de5\u5382,tyson", "title": "\u5370\u7b2c\u5b89\u7eb3\u5dde\u6cf0\u68ee\u98df\u54c1\u5de5\u5382\u8fd1900\u540d\u5de5\u4eba\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u68c0\u6d4b\u5448\u9633\u6027", "title_en": "Nearly 900 workers at Tyson Foods plant in Indiana test positive for coronavirus", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/nearly-900-tyson-foods-plant-indiana-test-positive-coronavirus", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u5de5\u5382", "tyson"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c2275ef7b92e4ddb8189c34292a6004e.png", "infoid": 1000425, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u5199\u4ea7\u54c1\u9700\u6c42\u6587\u6863(PRD)\uff0c\u6211\u627f\u8ba4\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4ece\u54ea\u91cc\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\u4f46\u6211\u77e5\u9053\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\uff1a\u6211\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u5bf9\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u4efd\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6027\u6587\u4ef6\u6301\u6000\u7591\u6001\u5ea6\u3002\n\u5728\u6211\u56de\u5230\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u9662\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u654f\u6377\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u8425\u9500\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u7ecf\u7406\u3002\u6211\u88ab\u704c\u8f93\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u522b\u7684Scrum\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u5ea6\u7684\u793c\u4eea\u3002\u6362\u53e5\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ee5\u6587\u6863\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u6d41\u7a0b\u7e41\u91cd\u3001\u4eea\u5f0f\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u82b1\u8d39\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7cbe\u529b\u3002\u53ea\u8bb0\u5f55\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u7b80\u5316\u6216\u6d88\u9664\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u53bb\u6389\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7e41\u6587\u7f1b\u8282\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u5199\u4e00\u4efd\u5bc6\u5bc6\u9ebb\u9ebb\u7684\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u91cd\u7533\u539f\u578b\u5df2\u7ecf\u5c55\u793a\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5417\uff1f\u55ef\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u5427\u3002\u4f46\u6211\u5b66\u5230\u4e86\u4e24\u4ef6\u4e8b\u3002\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u5ea6\u7684\u4eea\u5f0f\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6c38\u8fdc\u6ca1\u6709\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u5f53\u8c08\u5230\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u54c1\u65f6\uff0c\u786e\u5b9e\u9700\u8981\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u7406\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u7559\u4e0b\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u4f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u3002\n\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u540d\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728UX\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\uff0c\u6211\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u5728\u53ef\u70b9\u51fb\u539f\u578b\u4e2d\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u663e\u800c\u6613\u89c1\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u67d0\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u3002\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6211\u6b63\u5728\u5c3d\u6211\u6700\u5927\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u5728PRD\u4e2d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u8ba9\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\uff0c\u4f46\u53c8\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8d8a\u754c\u8fdb\u5165\u81c3\u80bf\u7684\u6587\u6863\u3002\u795d\u6211\u597d\u8fd0\uff01\n\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u8d44\u6e90\uff1a\n\u672c\u6307\u5357\u6df1\u5165\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u521b\u5efa\u9002\u5408\u654f\u6377\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u76caPRD\u3002\u5b83\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86PRD\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6210\u5206\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u7b80\u77ed\u548c\u751c\u871c\u3002(\u7ecf\u7531\u4e9a\u7279\u5170\u897f\u4e9a\u5c9b)", "note_en": "I\u2019m writing a product requirement document (PRD) for the first time, and I\u2019ll admit, I didn\u2019t know quite where to start. But I did know one thing: I knew that I was skeptical of such a time-intensive, technical document.\n Before I came back to grad school, I was a project manager on a marketing team using agile methodologies. I was indoctrinated into one scrum principle in particular:  Employ minimally sufficient ceremony. In other words, document-centric, process-heavy, high-ceremony approaches cost time and effort. Only document what you need to document. Simplify or eliminate processes whenever possible. Get rid of unnecessary formality.\n Yet here I am, tasked with writing a dense document that\u2019s just there to reiterate what the prototype already demonstrates, right? Well, maybe. But I\u2019ve learned two things.\n First,  minimally sufficient ceremony doesn\u2019t mean  no documentation ever, and when it comes to building a product, there does need to one source of truth that leaves little open to interpretation.\n Second, as the product designer who\u2019s been working on UX for months now, I forget what\u2019s obvious in the clickable prototype vs. what\u2019s still on a sketch somewhere, particularly when it comes to interaction design and content strategy.\n So, with that in mind, I\u2019m trying my best to translate the design in a PRD with just enough detail that the developer gets it, but without slipping over the line into bloated documentation. Wish me luck!\n In the mean time, here are a handful of resources that I\u2019ve found helpful:\n  This guide gives insight into how to make a lean PRD that fits into an agile approach. It walks through types of components usually found in PRDs and how to keep it all short and sweet.

"note_en": "I have a burning desire to become the best version of myself, to unlock my full human potential.\n In the past four months, I studied the subconsious mind. Not only theoretically, but putting what I learned into practice.\n While I believe that I have only scrached the surface, here are some of my results:\n    Most people are self-limiting. We can do way more than we believe. Even worse, most of us underrate ourselves; we shortchange ourselves, and sell ourselves short. The result is that most people suffer from feelings of inferiority.\n The goal is to \u201cget more living out of life\u201d. To become the best version we can be. It\u2019s our duty to use the talents and potential that we have.\n 95% of our behavior, feeling, and response is habitual and automatic. These automatic mechanisms play themselves out in the subconscious mind.\n   Feed this mechanism with thoughs of failure and past mistakes, and it will act as a failure mechanism.\n Feed this mechanism with optimism and a worthwhile goal, and it will act as a success mechanism.\n The sad thing is that most people are constantly reliving their failures and bad memories. They block and sabotage themselves.\n   When using the subconscious mind, we are in effect harnessing the placebo effect. Patients receiving a placebo believe they are receiving legitimate medicine. The key word is \u201cbelieve\u201d. We can use the same effect to cure illnesses and bring success to our lives.\n Our brain and nervous system cannot tell the difference between a real experience, and one that is vividly imagined.\n  We need to develop the habit of reliving past successes. Connect with \u201cthat winning feeling\u201d. And use this to \u201cprime\u201d ourselves for success.\n How can we succeed if we constantly remember our past failures and bad moments? It creates a negative spiral.\n What we want is a positive spiral. When you remember your past successes, it leads to self-confidence and optimism. This energy can then be used as fuel to create more success in the present moment.\n You need to \u201cstart with the end in mind\u201d. Picture the end result, as vividly as possible. If you are a musician, picture a finished song, picture standing on stage, performing your work. If you are an autor, picture the finished book, people reading it, telling you how much they liked it. Add details and feelings. Be proud of your work. Imagine people being happy and touched by your work.\n Relaxation is more important than willpower. Willpower leads to tension, which blocks your success mechanism. Just relax and let your automatic mechanism do the work.\n Your work is to imagine, to feel, and to feed the goal to your subconscious mind. Then relax and let your subconscious mind guide you. That\u2019s how \u201cgetting ideas in the shower\u201d works. You relax. You let things flow. And whatever you need to do comes automatically. No willpower needed.\n We need to maintain a positive aggressive goal-striving attitude. Attack challenges with massive action. Do this in reality as well as in imagination. Imagine yourself overcoming all challenges. Never fall back to a passive, defensive, victim-like attitude.\n  The failure-type personality does not direct his energy and emotional steam toward a worthwile goal. Instead, this person complains, drowns in self-pity or \u201cswallows\u201d his frustration, leading to illness and unhappiness.\n Work remains one of the best therapies, and one of the best tranquilizers for a troubled spirit.\n A human is like a bicycle. It maintains it\u2019s poise and equilibrium only so long as it is going forward toward something.\n Our disturbed feelings are caused not by externals, but by our own responses. We need to learn how to ignore, delay or change these responses.\n Mistakes are good. Without them, learning is impossible. But, mistakes are only a means to an end. Once we succeed, we should forget the mistakes. We should only remember the successful attempt.\n When your automatic mechanism is \u201cset for success\u201d we experience \u201cthat winning feeling\u201d.\n Develop a nostalgia for the future instead of for the past. Have something to look forward to. Don\u2019t live in the past. That\u2019s what old people do.\n Gradualness is important. We need to arrange things so that we can succeed in little things, and then gradually build up. Like weight lifters and boxers do. Success is build upon success. If you start with something too difficult, you will never have the momentum to continue.\n We are responsible for our own life. The past explains how we got here. But where we go from here is our responsibility. Blaming others and complaining does not improve our life. Accept where you came from, and do the best with what you have.\n As the placebo effect shows, the body is capable of healing itself. In fact, all healing is self-healing. \u201cThe surgeon dresses the wound, God heals it.\u201d\n We need to cultivate an \u201cinner smile\u201d. The best way is to imagine a goal, and feel good about having it. If you don\u2019t feel good about something, it won\u2019t work. Feelings are always stronger than thoughts. Your feelings and thoughts need to be in sync. If you imagine a goal but feel anxiety or frustration, the anxiety and frustration will win.\n Not even willpower can overcome feelings. You can expend as much willpower as you want, if you don\u2019t feel good about something, you won\u2019t achieve it.\n  Reserve judgement for 21 days, because it requires a minimum of 21 days to effect any perceptible change in a mental image or habit.\n The goal is to develop new habits, new automatic patters. Which means that daily practice is key. Even if it\u2019s just 5 minutes.\n  Practice the Cou\u00e9 method \u201eDay by day, in every way, I am getting better and better.\u201c (Repeat 20 times in a low, hearable voice)\n Tell yourself that you\u2019ll be having a great day today. You will feel good. You will be successful. The more emotion you use, the better.\n  Cou\u00e9 method: If you have physical or emotional pain, put your hand on the hurting spot or your head (emotional pain), then relax and repeat 20 times \u201cIt passes. It passes. It passes\u201d\n  Theatre of the mind When you begin, scan your body for tension and relax your head, torso, waist, legs, and so on\n  Then go into the future and picture how you want to be with the same feeling you felt in the past\n   How to be calmer Build an imaginary quiet room in your mind and retire to it regularly (your personal decompression chamber)\n Deliberate practice Practice whatever you want to improve in a realistic way (social situations, giving talks etc.)\n How to cure worry \u201cWhat is the worst that can possibly happen?\u201d and realize that it probably won\u2019t be so bad.\n Practice positive mental imagery, immediately and \u201con cue\u201d, whenever you become aware of negative feelings.\n How to change habits The best way to break a habit is to form a clear mental image of the desired end result, and to practice without effort toward reaching that goal\n Challenge your beliefs Don\u2019t just pass these questions by casually. Wrestle with them. Think hard on them. Get emotional about them.\n Can you see that you have cheated yourself and sold yourself short, not because of a \u201cfact\u201d, but only because some stupid belief?\n Whenever you are angry on someone, write a letter to the person. Pull out all the stops. Leave nothing to the imagination. Then burn the letter.\n  How to be calm Create in your imagination a vivid mental picture of yourself sitting quietly, composed, unmoved, \u201cletting the telephone ring\u201d\n Say to yourself, \u201cI am letting the telephone ring\u201d, whenever you are tempted to \u201cobey\u201d or respond to some fear-bell or anxiety-bell\n  See yourself in various situations that have in the past upset you, only now you remain \u201cset\u201d, settled, poised, by not responding.\n  \u201cSleep on it\u201d: Sometimes the best thing is to take a nap or sleep on something\n Clear your mechanism before undertaking a new task (go to your quiet room between tasks)\n See negative feelings as challenges Reframe negative situations into something positive: make an effort to find the positive in a situation\n Change your memories Change past failures, modify the memories, like you modify a tape recording by adding material or replacing a recording\n Play with your memories. You don\u2019t have to be a slave to them. Do with them whatever you want. Change them. Ignore them. Delete them.\n Act and feel young People get old when they stop moving, when they get stuck, when they stop going forward\n Live in day-tight compartments \u201cWhen I fall asleep I die. When I wake up I start a new life\u201d\n  Go through your day and change all negative situations into positive ones. Imagine you acted and reacted perfectly.\n Practice the Cou\u00e9 method \u201eDay by day, in every way, I am getting better and better.\u201c (Repeat 20 times in a low, hearable voice)\n Tell yourself that you will fall asleep easily. And that you will wake up fully refreshed.\n If you have children, you can make suggestions to them while they sleep (without waking them up), and also practice with them while they are awake.",

"note_en": "From fitness bracelets to glucose monitoring, modern technology has made it possible for people to quickly, accurately and effectively keep track of their own health condition. And what\u2019s good for humans is often also good for our furry friends.\n The booming global pet care market is projected to grow to US$280 billion by 2025. In recent years, AI techniques and IoT technologies have enabled big-data-based smart vet projects and innovative pet care products such as smart collars and smart feeding and watering systems that can be customized using machine learning algorithms. These frontier technologies are also helping owners provide their pets with healthier and longer lives.\n  Cat kidney disease is a nightmare for pet owners. While most cat kidney disease develops with age, chronic cat kidney disease happens randomly, has no cure, and is the number one cause of death for cats over five years old.  Mars Petcare, a Belgian company founded in 1937, has developed an artificial intelligence powered tool called RenalTech for early diagnosis of chronic cat kidney disease. The RenalTech system analyzes pet patient data including creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, white blood cell  ...\n  While chronic diseases are a diagnosis and treatment focus, pet owners also naturally worry about the general health condition of their pets. Moreover, maintaining a healthy life can help protect pets from other illnesses. Founded in 2018, UK-based startup Vet-AI is working on an innovative technology platform that can predict medical conditions in pets before they develop into serious problems. Vet-AI uses a Bayesian network to mimic the way a veterinarian thinks and calculate the probability  ...\n The ultimate goal for this tech is not to replace vets but to give them a tool that can help with early diagnosis. The company has already launched the first stage of its Vet-AI project, an app called Joii, which can provide comprehensive symptom check-ups for animal ailments.\n  Another topic that is attracting more and more attention is pet longevity. PetSensus, founded in Latvia in 2018, has developed a biomedical data platform using big data techniques. The platform collects data from pet owners and uses a homegrown machine learning model to generate a personalized pet care guide. Petsensus recently entered into a partnership with Insilico Medicine to find ways to extend pet longevity.

It may seem like a trivial topic of discussion but as the saying goes:\n There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. - Phil Karlton\n The aforementioned blogpost outlines conventions on how feature branches could be named; prepending with an ID from an issue tracker and using hyphens as separators for a short description of the feature the branch addresses. For example:\n  This would work, but in the real-world, feature branches rarely address such a large item as &#34;billing module&#34;. While developing, we typically work on smaller subtasks of such a feature. Ideally, of course, each subtask would have issue tracker IDs but they often don&#39;t. Branches related to the same feature would typically look like this:\n  Given that this is the case, both  GitHub and  GitLab have adopted referencing the issue in the commit instead as the solution for connecting to the issue tracker.\n The naming of feature branches then, depends on their purpose: they should be short-lived, task-oriented and, deleted when they&#39;re merged. Their purpose is agility.\n While I agree with the kebab-casing of branch names, as developers we should remain free to name our branches as we see fit. Feature branches should stay lightweight and should  not be used to create yet another process.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 05:48:45", "tags": "\u5206\u652f,branch,branches", "title": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684Git\u5206\u652f\u547d\u540d\u7ea6\u5b9a", "title_en": "Git Branch Naming Conventions for the Real World", "transed": 1, "url": "https://blog.kowsheek.com/git-branch-naming-conventions-for-the-real-world/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u5206\u652f", "branch", "branches"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000419, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Juliusz Chroboczek JCH at iif.fr Fri May 1 12\uff1a15\uff1a56 BST 2020\u55e8\uff0c\u5f88\u62b1\u6b49\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u7bc7\u79bb\u9898\u7684\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u6ee5\u7528\u4e86\u8fd9\u4efd\u5217\u8868\u3002\u4f60\u4eec\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u8bb0\u5f97\u51e0\u5468\u524d\u6211\u5e7f\u544a\u8fc7\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9WebRTC\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u6211\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u8c08\u8bdd\u65b9\u5f0f(\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u5f88\u597d)\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u4e3a\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6628\u5929\u521a\u521a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u670912\u4eba\u53c2\u52a0\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae(12\u4eba\u8fdb\u6765\uff0c132\u4eba\u6d41\u51fa)\uff0c\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e3e\u884c\u4e86\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u60f3..\u3002", "note_en": "Juliusz Chroboczek  jch at irif.fr    Fri May 1 12:15:56 BST 2020  Hi, and sorry for abusing this list for another off-topic post.Some of you may remember the peer-to-peer WebRTC server I advertised a fewweeks ago.
