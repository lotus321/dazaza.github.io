Working closely with cutting-edge deep learning teams across a variety of industries, a clear narrative emerged: without better infrastructure, training deep learning models at scale remains extremely difficult, as organizations move from research to production. This feedback led us to build the Determined Training Platform, which now powers teams of Deep Learning Engineers and large GPU clusters  ...\n Our innovative infrastructure platform is now ready for widespread adoption, and we\u2019re excited to share it with the DL community! Today we are announcing that  we have  open sourced our deep learning training platform under the Apache 2.0 license.\n  We designed the  Determined Training Platform to empower Deep Learning Engineers to focus on the task at hand \u2014 training high-quality models. To achieve this goal, our platform tightly integrates all of the features that a DL engineer needs to train models at scale, including:\n  High-performance distributed training that just works.Determined \u2019s distributed training support builds upon Horovod, a popular distributed training framework, but includes a suite of optimizations that results in twice the performance of stock Horovod. Moreover, Determined \u2019s distributed training support is easy to set up (no code changes are needed to move from single-GPU to distributed training), and allows multiple users to seamlessly share the same GPU cluster.

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has committed $250 million directly to fight the pandemic.\n Indeed, in  an interview with the Financial Times, the Microsoft co-founder pledged that the $40 billion foundation would give its \u201ctotal attention\u201d to a crisis that he fears will cost the world \u201ctens of trillions of dollars.\u201d\n He told the newspaper, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken an organization that was focused on HIV and malaria and polio eradication, and almost entirely shifted it to work on this. This has the foundation\u2019s total attention. Even our non-health related work, like higher education and K-12 (schools), is completely switched around to look at how you facilitate online learning.\u201d\n His fact-based approach and his defense of the World Health Organization have also put him at odds with a president for whom truth is, er, situational. This has  made Gates a target of right-wing attacks and conspiracy theories.\n The world\u2019s second-richest person stepping up in this arena is a contrast to the richest, Jeff Bezos, who is back hands-on at Amazon. The pandemic has brought hefty revenues to Seattle\u2019s largest company because of stay-home shoppers \u2014 but also unprecedented challenges. Bezos said Thursday the \u201ccurrent crisis is demonstrating the adaptability and durability of Amazon\u2019s business as never before, but it\u2019s also the hardest time we\u2019ve ever

Wall Street on Thursday by  posting a first-quarter profit despite the wider economic slowdown brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.\n  Today\u2019s tweet might be extra curious those who remember the details of Musk\u2018s settlement with the SEC over alleged securities fraud.\n Aside from having to step down as company\u00a0chairman, it requires someone\u00a0 double-check any Musk tweet that might affect\u00a0value of Tesla stock.\n When asked about how this process will work in  a 60 minutes interview, Musk said it himself: \u201cThe only tweets that would have to be say \u2018reviewed,\u2019 would be if it had a probability of causing a movement in the stock.\u201d\n After being pressed on how one would know if a tweet had that potential, he quipped: \u201cI guess we

Musk said someone had left the keys in the vehicle and the door open overnight, causing the Model S to enter into a \u201cwaiting for driver\u201d mode that depleted 2 percent of the vehicle\u2019s battery. This resulted in the slightly less than 400-mile range.\n Not so, said the EPA. \u201cWe can confirm that EPA tested the vehicle properly, the door was closed, and we are happy to discuss any technical issues with Tesla, as we do routinely with all automakers,\u201d an EPA spokesperson said in a statement to  The Verge.\n  On other technology fronts, we increased the range of model S and X yet again, this time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X. Actually, we said that, actually, the model \u2014 the real Model S range is 400 miles, but when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, [EPA] left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car - and it did this overnight.\n And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost 2% of its range. And as a result, it had a 391 test. As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we\u2019re actually confident that we will achieve a 400-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months \u2014 the true range of the Model S for the past two months has been 400 miles.\n  Update May 1st, 5:20pm ET:  Updated to include Musk\u2019s

"note_en": "The news that Professor John Martinis had resigned from Google sent ripples through the entire quantum community.\u00a0A few days after the announcement, I was on two previously scheduled calls with quantum executives and a call with another quantum\u00a0CEO.\u00a0Each was as baffled and as curious about Professor Martinis&#39; departure from Google as I was.\n  I had read a few quotes attributed to Professor Martinis as the reason he resigned.\u00a0Somehow the remarks seemed to lack enough \u00a0justification for such a big move on his part. I thought more detail was needed, and Professor Martinis agreed to clarify the record.\n  We are in an era of quantum experimentation and development. There are a handful of quantum scientists today that I believe will be historical figures a hundred years from now.\u00a0John Martinis is one of those people.\u00a0He has made monumental contributions to quantum computing, including handing Google the title to the historic achievement of quantum supremacy.\n     For those reasons, instead of an article with a few quotes by him, I decided to publish the full transcript of our conversation, and Professor Martinis gave his permission.\u00a0In the interview, he describes details of his complex situation and why he ultimately decided to resign. \u00a0Additionally, you&#39;ll find many nuggets and surprises in the \u00a0interview.\n  Small parts of the transcript have been edited for clarity and I have entered notes where appropriate. My original plan was to provide a summary of my thoughts and conclusions. However, Professor Martinis was completely open about his relationship with the hardware group and with his manager, Hartmut Neven, founder of the Google Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab. After reviewing the transcript, I felt everything was said that needed to be said. All my questions were answered. I will say  ...\n        I was very\u00a0curious about the reason you left Google. The quote that was attributed to you as the reason didn&#39;t make sense to me.\u00a0So maybe we could start at the beginning for some background.\n            Yes, that&#39;s right. I was a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and we had government funding and were doing quite well. Google got interested and my group and I came over to work at Google, basically because we both wanted to build a useful quantum computer.\n        I think at the time it was in the teens.\u00a0It was a good-sized group, but not everyone came over at first.\u00a0For most of the students, they came to Google after they graduated with their PhD.\n    I did a count and it appears that you and your group published about 200 papers while you were at Google.\n    While at Google, that seems high, but I have published a large number of papers in my career and a lot of them on quantum. I was also involved in other research.\u00a0I actually started with quantum computing when I was a PhD student way back in the mid-eighties at UC Berkeley.\n    What was the agreement when you first went to Google as far as maintaining a leadership role?\n    So, of course I had a leadership role at UC Santa Barbara, and I was quite concerned about changing that. When I moved to Google, Hartmut [Neven] was running the project.\u00a0He had started a quantum project [at google] and he&#39;s the one who wanted to hire me.\u00a0I was the head of the hardware group and he was head of the whole quantum AI group. So that&#39;s the way we started.\n    You did some amazing work while you were at Google. You\u00a0handed them the title to quantum supremacy. There was some controversy, but it was an important\u00a0milestone, and you did it.\n    We talked publicly about quantum supremacy for a couple of years and how we were going to do it. I think a lot of people thought it was a pretty bold milestone, but we were excited about the challenge.\u00a0I thought the later controversy drummed up by IBM was a kind of\u00a0fake news.\u00a0But in the end, it worked out okay, as controversy brought attention.\n    As it turned out, if you&#39;d used\u00a0a few more qubits, it would have been far beyond the reach of any classical computer and there would have been no question about its validity.\n    Yes, that \u2019s correct. Scott Aaronson at UT Austin wrote a piece in the New York Times describing the impact. You can quibble about details, but the strangest part is that IBM said that the Summit computer was able to do this, but it was basically a white paper, and they [IBM] actually didn&#39;t run a program. Of course, if you&#39;re going to claim something for experimental physics or computer science, you should actually run programs. I&#39;ve  ...\n    When did you first sense there was a problem with your relationship at Google with Hartmut Neven?\n    This is a complex situation, but I can outline it for you. There has been tension for several years now, but it mostly has been with the hardware group. It started around the time we first proposed quantum supremacy. To explain the tension, you should understand that my personal research style tends to be very intently focused. For example, with the quantum supremacy experiment, I focused on doing the experiment because I thought it would be  ...\n  Note: At this point, Professor Martinis asked me if I had read Peter Thiel&#39;s book,  Zero to One. Thiel was a co-founder of\u00a0PayPal and Palantir. He explained that Peter Thiel defines personality styles as either a definite optimist or indefinite optimist. Professor  Martinis considers himself to be a definite optimist. One quote from Thiel&#39;s book seems to mirror his thinking: \u201c\u2026a definite person determines the one best thing to do and  ...\n    It&#39;s okay. Anyway, he [Peter Thiel] says that most people in the US are indefinite optimists. And everyone says, oh yeah, we can build a quantum computer, but everyone is doing very general research on it, but with indefinite goals. My view is, I definitely want to create a quantum computer with some particular design. I saw the quantum supremacy experiment and I thought let&#39;s focus on this and let&#39;s get it to work. So, there&#39;s  ...\n        My personality is to intensely focus on some goal.\u00a0\u00a0I think this was hard on the group.\u00a0Once we got quantum supremacy to work, and we didn&#39;t need such intense focus, people naturally wanted more independence.\n  Also, leaders of the group came from UC Santa Barbara, and it&#39;s very natural to want to leave your advisor and form your own group and be independent.\u00a0Hartmut saw that too, and he is much more of an indefinite optimist than I am.\u00a0Seeing all\u00a0the tension, they [the group] and management thought it would be better if I wasn&#39;t leading the project anymore. Three people in the project would be co-leaders and I would be advising.\n        Initially, I thought it wasn&#39;t going to work for me. But it was clear that&#39;s what everyone wanted. We went ahead and I tried it for nine months. During those nine months I was productive, as I invented a way to scale up the qubits and solved some wiring technology. I was doing my job, but I felt uncomfortable about the direction the project was going on the five to ten-year time scale. After some other bad events happened,  ...\n    Yes, I completely understand. What was competing for control of the group at the time? Was it anything in particular or was it just that the group wanted more freedom?\n    Yes. I&#39;ll give you a\u00a0specific example that happened last year.\u00a0It was very difficult for me at the time.\n  When wiring a qubit system, it is very important to figure it out in a scalable, cost-sensitive way. I had been developing some new technology that was quite far along. I was quite proud of various inventions, as solutions were somewhat tricky, and you had to think very carefully about how to build a system. Wiring is funny as it is something that everyone thinks they can do, but it&#39;s subtle. But one theorist, who  ...\n  This went on and on, so I started talking to Hartmut about it, explaining that it didn&#39;t make sense. We have a relatively small group and we don&#39;t have an abundance of \u00a0resources. And I have it covered, so we should stop this other program.\u00a0But Hartmut didn\u2019t back me up and wanted to go ahead and try both.\n  I guess I just didn&#39;t handle that very well. I was the lead of the hardware group, but I couldn&#39;t stop a project that didn&#39;t make any sense to me.\n        More precisely, I had already lost control. I wasn&#39;t really leading the hardware group, but of course still felt responsibility, like getting the quantum supremacy experiment to work. In the end, Hartmut and I just disagreed on what to do. But he&#39;s the boss, so it \u2019s his decision. I think this whole year-long process made me very uncomfortable, and I just couldn&#39;t handle it because I have been making  ...\n    You were making good progress toward increasing the number of qubits. I think one of the quotes I read said that you were on the path\u00a0to making a quantum computer with a few hundred to a thousand qubits.\n    Yes, we have this plan, and even one for a much larger quantum computer.\u00a0As a definite optimist, I liked that we had a definite plan that made sense to the group.\u00a0After the quantum supremacy results, google management was very supportive, so everything was going great.\n        Yes, but I was not very happy because I disagreed with some important decisions. I had many talks with Hartmut about it, especially about the leadership role.\u00a0I thought it would be the most reliable path to follow my expertise, since I have had a successful history.\n  And in the end, I felt that the group had a good plan, and they know what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re all very smart, they&#39;re going to be happy doing it their way. And I can go off and do science in the way I know best.\u00a0I want to help the world of quantum computing in a way that makes sense to me.\n  I&#39;m sad because I really thought we really could build something amazing together, but you know, things don&#39;t always work out the way you want.\u00a0You just have to figure out the best way forward.\n    When you get in a situation like that, it&#39;s a lot easier if you just step away.\u00a0I assume you&#39;re going to keep working on quantum projects.\n    I&#39;ve had a lot of inquiries from people. And I still would like to build a quantum computer with this definite-optimistic approach.\u00a0But this requires a good amount of funding, so I\u2019ll see if it\u2019s possible.\n  One idea is to work with other qubits groups, who are making different qubits, to figure out how they can scale up and build a large quantum computer.\u00a0Because I have an example with superconducting qubits that I now understand well, I hope to use those ideas for these other approaches. So, this might be a great opportunity.\n        Yes, I would. We would obviously want to discuss all of this.\u00a0Maybe we just need right now some social distancing. I did like working for Google and Hartmut, and maybe there is some way to make everyone happy.\u00a0I wish them the best. They&#39;re a great team.\n        There&#39;s going to be some really nice papers coming out using the quantum-supremacy Sycamore chip. Maybe not be quite so impactful [as quantum supremacy], but they are really going to advance the field a lot in applications as a cloud quantum computer. There should be more great results coming out of the group in the next few years.\n        Oh yes.\u00a0Everyone is still working there, which is great.\u00a0They will have more independence and say in planning their project, so I am happy for them.\n    When do you think we&#39;ll see a useful superconducting quantum computer? Can we do it in the next five years?\n    Hartmut has talked about this, so I can explain some more. The Google plan is roughly to build a million-qubit system in about ten years, with sufficiently low errors to do error correction. Then at that point you will have enough error-corrected logical qubits that you can run useful, powerful algorithms that you now can&#39;t solve on a classical supercomputer.  ...\n    Well, that&#39;s all my questions. I really appreciate your time. Is there anything I didn&#39;t ask that you would like to say?\n    Oh, I&#39;m just going to say that technically the group at Google is doing great. They have a good plan. They have really good scientists there. And I&#39;m excited that they&#39;ll be able to make progress and push this forward.\u00a0I wish them the best.\n        Okay.
