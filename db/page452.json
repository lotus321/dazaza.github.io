When you breathe in, the air you breathe is being filtered by the mask; when you breathe out, it is not. (The valve only operates in one direction.)\n One-way valves make sense if you\u2019re kicking up sawdust in your basement,  walking around California during wildfire season or working in a factory where particles you definitely don\u2019t want to breathe in may be in the air. In these cases, the mask\u2019s job is to protect you. The valve makes it more comfortable to wear so you can get through your day or your factory shift without feeling too stifled.\n     In the age of COVID-19, we wear masks when out and about for two reasons: First, we  hope they might protect us from other people, at least a little bit. (The science on this is not very convincing.) The second reason is more significant:   they protect us from infecting others if it turns out  we are infected and don\u2019t know it.\n    Valves defeat that second purpose. A valved mask is letting your breath out unfiltered; the valve acts as a little escape hatch for any virus-laden droplets you\u2019re breathing out. Some municipalities that require masks have specified that   masks with valves do not count. You also won\u2019t typically see valved masks in healthcare settings for the same reason. As the CDC   explains:\n respirators with exhalation valves should not be used in situations where a sterile field must be maintained (e.g., during an invasive procedure in an operating or procedure room) because the exhalation valve allows unfiltered exhaled air to escape into the sterile field.\n  If you have a stash of N95s that you previously used as dust masks, or if you\u2019re considering buying a designer cloth mask that has a valve (somehow the fancy ones all seem to have valves), be aware that they only filter your inhaled air, not your exhaled air. And right now, that\u2019s not good enough.\n As the saying goes, \u201cyour mask protects me, my mask protects you,\u201d so please use a valve-less mask to do your part in reducing transmission.",

"note_en": "A woman in  Texas was isolating with her family. She was frightened and carried a secret: she was eight weeks pregnant.\n Even under normal circumstances, obtaining an abortion in Texas is described as \u201c mostly impossible\u201d. But during the Covid-19 pandemic, politicians in Texas and seven other states have worked to try to halt abortions entirely. They have undertaken  costly lawsuits to restrict abortion in the name of health and safety, even as doctors lined up against them.\n Experts have described the order as the most chaotic 30 days since 2013, when Texas imposed severe restrictions on abortion clinics, later overturned by the supreme court.\n Alabama,  Arkansas,  Iowa,  Louisiana,  Ohio,  Tennessee and  West Virginia have all seen confusion and intermittent bans as anti-abortion state politicians categorized abortion services as non-essential, and included abortion clinics in bans on elective surgical procedures. The orders have left women desperate, as appointments were cancelled, rescheduled and cancelled again subject to court rulings.\n \u201cI am scared to go outside,\u201d said the Texas woman, who the Guardian is not naming because her family is not aware she is pregnant and seeking an abortion. Her story was provided by We Testify, a group which collects women\u2019s stories of seeking abortions. \u201cI just saw the news about  Ohio and that scared me that I can\u2019t get an abortion in time,\u201d she said about restrictions in that state. \u201cNow, they did it in Texas. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n  Abortion clinics across the US face existential threats under normal circumstances. Providers and clinics routinely face state harassment, angry protesters and threats of violence.\n Abortion providers said Covid-19 has exacerbated this fight, with some states claiming abortions need to be stopped during the pandemic to preserve hospital beds and personal protective equipment for workers.\n \u201cNo one is exempt from the governor\u2019s executive order on medically unnecessary surgeries and procedures, including abortion providers,\u201d said the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton,  early in the pandemic. \u201cThose who violate the governor\u2019s order will be met with the full force of the law.\u201d Paxton did not return a call for comment.\n The American Medical Association, the country\u2019s largest association of physicians, has described such regulations as \u201c exploiting\u201d the Covid-19 pandemic.\n \u201cInstead of saying, for example, \u2018There should be no abortion\u2019... [abortion opponents] are trying to create uncertainty about what the reality on the ground is,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and an expert on reproductive rights.\n  At the same time, clinic directors have anecdotally reported a rise in demand amid the myriad uncertainties raised by the pandemic. More than  26 million Americans have lost jobs, with more unemployment claims expected, and at least  55,000 people have died as a result of the virus. One clinic in Wichita, Kansas, reported an almost threefold increase in patients,  CBS reported.\n \u201cPeople are delaying all kinds of medical care to stay out of hospitals. You can\u2019t put a pregnancy on pause, so imagine being forced into that position \u2013 it must be terrifying\u201d, said the Very Reverend Katherine Hancock Ragsdale, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation said\n Texas politicians\u2019 decision to ban abortion set off a month-long ping-pong of court battles. As Covid-19 spread ferociously in the US in March and April, federal court rulings restored, then abolished, abortion access multiple times, sometimes just hours apart.\n On 23 March, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, issued an  executive order halting all elective surgical procedures, specifically calling out abortion. Abortion providers sued on 25 March, a federal court agreed with them and blocked the state\u2019s order on 30 March.\n But the reprieve lasted only 21 hours. The fifth circuit court of appeals in New Orleans,  Louisiana, reinstated Texas\u2019s executive order on 31 March. The court\u2019s bench is arguably the most conservative in the nation, and is outwardly hostile to abortion rights.\n \u201cThey were open one day, and they were closed the next day, and they were allowed to do medication abortions one day, and not the next day,\u201d said Nikiya Natale, statewide manager of the Texas Equal Access Fund, which helps women pay for abortions.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve had to cancel hundreds of appointments \u2026 and numerous times,\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which operates clinics in Texas and four other states. Whole Woman\u2019s Health sued Texas to continue providing abortions. \u201cWomen are sobbing on the phone, begging,\u201d she said. The process, she said, felt like \u201cabuse\u201d.\n  At one point, only four abortion clinics in Texas were open to serve a population of 5.8 million women of reproductive age, she said. Three of them were Whole Woman\u2019s Health locations. That has left clinics across the state with a month\u2019s worth of patients on a waiting list.\n In other states, similar situations have played out. An epileptic woman in  Tennessee with twins, premature infant daughters and a two-year-old son told a federal court of her attempt to get an abortion, when she was caught up in that state\u2019s ban.\n To prevent another pregnancy, she underwent a tubal ligation and used condoms as well. She was in disbelief when both failed. \u201cI feel science failed me,\u201d she told the court.\n When she tried to obtain an abortion, arguments were already under way in court. One Friday in April, it was legal to get an abortion. But by Monday, before she could go to the clinic, it was banned.\n \u201cI was terrified again,\u201d she told the court. \u201cCaring for a toddler and two twin babies alone, while exhausted from and deeply anxious about an unwanted pregnancy, worrying every day that the pregnancy will suddenly leave me unable to care for my kids, and managing all of this in the midst of a pandemic.\u201d\n Monied interests have also come to support the bans. In just one example, one of Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorneys,  Jay Sekulow, bragged about his faith-based not-for-profit legal centers support for Texas\u2019s abortion ban.\n (@JaySekulow) BREAKING: The  @ACLJ has helped secure a huge victory for life in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals out of Texas. The Court agreed with our argument, concluding that there\u2019s \u201cno constitutional right to any particular  #abortion procedure.\u201d  https://t.co/NDG66plP0n\n \u201cThe [American Center for Law and Justice] has helped secure a huge victory for life in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals out of Texas,\u201d Sekulow tweeted.\n The back and forth has forced women, at least the few with means, to travel at an exceptionally dangerous time, boarding planes or driving out of state and violating stay-at-home orders.\n \u201cWe had someone who flew in from Texas,\u201d said Renee Chelian, founder of Northland Family Planning Clinics in Detroit, Michigan. \u201cShe had family here, but she got on a plane and flew. None of the rest of us are flying.\u201d\n When workers from Whole Woman Health\u2019s called to reschedule patients, some were in the car driving to neighboring Oklahoma and New Mexico. The women would ask, are you sure we should turn around? Is 5am too early to come in?\n As restrictions have gone into place, interest has grown in self-managed abortions. Plan C, a website which provides information on self-managed abortions, saw daily visits grow 20% in April and 11% in March, around the time states enacted bans.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no reason in the world that a great number of abortions can\u2019t be done through telemedicine,\u201d said Ragsdale. \u201cTalk to your doctor, or video conference, and have the drugs delivered to your home. The  FDA regulations don\u2019t allow that \u2013 it\u2019s time they do.\u201d\n  Even in states supportive of abortion clinic directors have said protesters have become more antagonistic during the pandemic, flouting social distancing guidelines.\n \u201cThese people are standing out in front of abortion clinics, harassing women, refusing to wear masks,\u201d Chelian said.\n Some of Chelian\u2019s clinic protesters, who are reliable regulars week-in and week-out, have joined pro-gun, anti-social-distancing rallies at the  Michigan  capitol of Lansing. \u201cAt the end of March, they were claiming as Christians they won\u2019t get the virus\u201d, she said.\n This article was amended on 30 April 2020 to correct the name of We Testify and to correct Nikiya Natale\u2019s job

"note_en": "The   app is now available in Australia \ud83d\ude37  However, it&#39;s a shame that they have decided not to release the source code for full transparency.  Luckily, I&#39;m a curious chap and also a professional mobile developer.\n So, I&#39;ve downloaded and decompiled the Android app using the freely available, open source tools apktool and JadX.  Here are my findings for those who are interested interested:\n First things first, the app is not obsfucated (scrambled); this means we can decompile it to a level almost as good as having the original source code.  They may not have released the source code but there is a clear intent of transparency displayed by not obsfucating it.\n The Android app looks to be written in Kotlin and uses Android building blocks like activities, services, broadcast receivers, RoomDatabase, Retrofit etc  Industry standard stuff.\n Given the Android app is Kotlin, I expect   iOS is written in Swift and uses the standard iOS APIs.  iOS apps take much more work to reverse engineer so this is simply a guess on my part.\n Data is stored locally in a SQLite database using the RoomDatabase API.  This places collected data inside the apps internal storage, a secure part of your phone strictly private to  .\n This means data is secured using the operating systems security mechanisms and *is not* accessible by other applications.  Unless you have a jail-broken device or have deliberately unlocked root permissions, the data collected by   is secure.\n The app broadcasts a unique BluetoohLE SSID that other phones with   installed can use to detect it.  Importantly, the app *does not* broadcast the device name so when another phone detects you, you are identified using a Bluetooth address and not a device name.\n then uses a BluetoothLeScanner to watch for other devices that broadcast the apps known SSID.  Basically,   only picks up and records other phones that have given their permission to broadcast.  This implementation is vanilla Android and is industry standard.\n In terms of data transmission and remote storage, the app requires that the user manually uploads the data.  The only place in the app that transmits the data is the UploadDataUseCase:\n The data upload is authenticated by a One Time Pin request that is sent your mobile phone.  This is important as all data upload is through user consent only.\n Lastly, data is transmitted via HTTPS to an AWS instance secured with a public/private key pair.  Web development and security is not my domain so I&#39;ll leave it to others to verify the locality of that endpoint.\n It&#39;s also interesting to note that there is a cleanup task that automatically deletes all records after 21 days.\n From what I can see, everything in the   app is above board, very transparent and follows industry standard.  I&#39;d interested in hearing perspectives on the app from my tech friends. Please chime in if you are also having a dig around and find something of note \ud83d\ude0a\n Also, my good friend  @GeoffreyHuntley is doing a much more thorough tear down of the app.  See here:\n Another important update, please take a look at  @VTeagueAus&#39;s investigation into  .  She is a security expert and is definitely more qualified than myself to comment on the apps privacy and security.\n We are running a live panel discussing our findings of   tomorrow night.

10.240.0.38(\u8bf7\u8010\u5fc3\u7b49\u5f85).d", "note_en": "FTL usually refers to &#34;faster than light&#34;. A theoretical particle known as a tachyon that powers certain spaceships in the Star Trek universe keeps the plot going for decades through multiple series and and movie franchises.\n Today though, we are going to be talking about running linux applications faster than linux. Our company,  NanoVMs has been working with unikernels for a while now but we&#39;ve mostly been focused on their security properties and had not put much thought into their performance considerations.\n Some have even correctly pointed out that  nanos is not a traditional &#34;true blue&#34; unikernel as it retains different privilege levels for kernel vs user code. This is because there are certain privileged instructions that allow you to change page mappings and if you have that capability then all the ASLR and page protections in the world don&#39;t matter. You&#39;re going to get hacked.\n Having said that, there&#39;s nothing preventing us from running software faster than most linux distributions or linux in general. In fact it is almost a guarantee because linux is a general purpose operating system and is simply built to run everything from the latest FPS game to a load bearing database to doing inference at the edge.\n It was also purpose built to run on bare metal and so it has facilities that a unikernel would never incorporate. Over half of linux is device drivers and it&#39;s not a case of you deciding what to pick/choose for your hand-rolled kernel. Keep in mind these same design concepts (multiple process, multiple users, interactivity) are what powered the PDP-7.\n  As much trash as we talk on the multiple process model   you kind of need it for bare metal installations. You want that capability for the laptop or phone you are reading this article on. However, for production server-side applications that always run inside of a virtual machine, which is mostly 99% of everything server-side nowadays, that condition goes away.\n In fact we don&#39;t want users, nor do we want remote interactive access, nor do we want a bunch of random crap running that is not our software. There&#39;s already one layer of linux running as the hypervisor - does the guest need to be a heavy-weight GPOS as well? It is these environmental characteristics that allows us to do what we do.\n Before we go further down the road it should be clear linux is a general purpose operating system and as such has many use-cases - for example, linux is and will forever be our favorite development environments.\n Not only do we get security benefits by only allowing one application to run it tends to run much, much faster. There are a  lot of unikernel projects out there, but at the end of the day cloning decades of kernel work just takes a ton of time and effort and it can be years before you see performance gains for commonly used software.\n Since  OPS is written in Go and we have numerous other software projects at our company written in Go we&#39;ve used Go quite a lot for testing and thus that&#39;s where we&#39;ve started seeing some results. You should be able to replicate this with most Go releases just by using the latest Nanos release but if you are using Go 1.14 you&#39;ll need to build nanos from source (or use the nightly release) as we  just threw in a SA_ONSTACK fix. A scheduling change was made between Go 1.13 and  ...\n  To build from source you&#39;ll need to clone  Nanos and a simple make is necessary. If you haven&#39;t installed  OPS yet you should do so. From there you can copy your local build to the latest ops release like so:\n  It is highly recommended to just use the pre-built releases from  OPS if you can.\n  package main import (  &#34;fmt&#34;  &#34;net/http&#34;)  func  main () { fmt.Println( &#34;hello world!&#34;) http.HandleFunc( &#34;/&#34;,   func (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { fmt.Fprintf(w,  &#34;Welcome to my website!&#34;) }) fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir( &#34;static/&#34;)) http.Handle( &#34;/static/&#34;, http.StripPrefix( &#34;/static/&#34;, fs)) http.ListenAndServe( &#34;0.0.0.0:8080&#34;,  nil)}\n       Now let&#39;s spin up 2 more instances on GCE directly. One for the benchmarking using  ab and one for the go webserver to just sit on a debian instance.\n Don&#39;t be dumb like the author and wonder why the latency is two orders of magnitude difference from a different region -  use the same region and zone you are using with OPS:\n   \u279c ~ scp -i ~ /.ssh/nope eyberg@nsa.com:~ /y/hackernoon .hackernoon  100%  7321KB  9.0MB/s  00: 00\u279c ~ gcloud beta compute scp --zone  &#34;us-west2-a&#34; --project  &#34;project-something&#34; hackernoon  &#34;gtest&#34;:~ /.\n        eyberg@bench:~$ ab -c  1 -n  100 http: //10.240.0.38:8080/This is ApacheBench, Version  2.3 &lt;$Revision:  1757674 $&gt;Copyright  1996 Adam Twiss, Zeus Technology Ltd,  : //www.zeustech.net/Licensed to The Apache Software Foundation,  : //www.apache.org/Benchmarking  10.240 .0 .38 (be patient).....doneServer Software:Server Hostname:  10.240 .0 .38Server Port:  8080Document Path:  /Document Length: 22 bytesConcurrency Level: 1Time taken for tests: 0.028 secondsComplete requests: 100Failed requests:  ...\n eyberg@bench:~$ ab -c  1 -n  100 http: //10.240.0.41:8080/This is ApacheBench, Version  2.3 &lt;$Revision:  1757674 $&gt;Copyright  1996 Adam Twiss, Zeus Technology Ltd,  : //www.zeustech.net/Licensed to The Apache Software Foundation,  : //www.apache.org/Benchmarking  10.240 .0 .41 (be patient).....doneServer Software:Server Hostname:  10.240 .0 .41Server Port:  8080Document Path:  /Document Length: 22 bytesConcurrency Level: 1Time taken for tests: 0.037 secondsComplete requests: 100Failed requests:  ...\n Ok - got them warmed up.

Now before you get all crazy on the twitters keep in mind that benchmarking can measure  lots of things. To be utterly painfully clear - these benchmarks are   very crude and naive. They are only meant to get you interested - not necessarily prove anything. This was merely looking at a go webserver requests/second. Measuring a different language like Rust or Node will produce very different results.\n In fact - let&#39;s go ahead and do just that. Let&#39;s look at a simple Rust webserver real quick:\n use std::io::{Read, Write}; use std::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream}; use std::thread;  fn  handle_read( mut stream: &amp;TcpStream) {  let  mut buf = [ 0u8;  4096];  match stream.read(&amp; mut buf) {  Ok(_) =&gt; {  let req_str =  String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;buf);  // println!(&#34;{}&#34;, req_str); }  Err(e) =&gt;  println!( &#34;Unable to read stream: {}&#34;, e), }}  fn  handle_write( mut stream: TcpStream) {  let response =  b&#34;HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello  ...\n export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/gcloud.jsonops image create -c config.json -a main -i rustz1ops instance create -z us-west2 -a -i rustz1\n Using the same config as before we&#39;ll upload it to Google and spin up three new instances. One for the rust unikernel, one for a debian instance on the same subnet and one running debian w/the rust webserver on it. Note: I&#39;m choosing debian for no other choice than it&#39;s the default choice and so would be used quite a lot.\n    eyberg@dtest:~$ ab -c 1 -n 100 http://10.240.0.94:8080/This is ApacheBench, Version 2.3 &lt; $Revision: 1757674 $&gt;Copyright 1996 Adam Twiss, Zeus Technology Ltd, http://www.zeustech.net/Licensed to The Apache Software Foundation, http://www.apache.org/Benchmarking 10.240.0.94 (be patient)..... doneServer Software:Server Hostname: 10.240.0.94Server Port: 8080Document Path: /Document Length: 39 bytesConcurrency Level: 1Time taken  fortests: 0.025 secondsComplete requests:  ...\n  eyberg@dtest:~$ ab -c 1 -n 100 http://10.240.0.8:8080/This is ApacheBench, Version 2.3 &lt; $Revision: 1757674 $&gt;Copyright 1996 Adam Twiss, Zeus Technology Ltd, http://www.zeustech.net/Licensed to The Apache Software Foundation, http://www.apache.org/Benchmarking 10.240.0.8 (be patient)..... doneServer Software:Server Hostname: 10.240.0.8Server Port: 8080Document Path: /Document Length: 39 bytesConcurrency Level: 1Time taken  fortests: 0.021 secondsComplete requests: 100Failed  ...\n Keep in mind these are on 1vCPU instances, but let&#39;s go ahead and up the concurrency:\n eyberg@dtest:~$ ab -c 10 -n 1000 http://10.240.0.94:8080/This is ApacheBench, Version 2.3 &lt; $Revision: 1757674 $&gt;Copyright 1996 Adam Twiss, Zeus Technology Ltd, http://www.zeustech.net/Licensed to The Apache Software Foundation, http://www.apache.org/Benchmarking 10.240.0.94 (be patient)Completed 100 requestsCompleted 200 requestsCompleted 300 requestsCompleted 400 requestsCompleted 500 requestsCompleted 600 requestsCompleted 700 requestsCompleted 800 requestsCompleted  ...\n  eyberg@dtest:~$ ab -c 10 -n 1000 http://10.240.0.8:8080/ [53/188]This is ApacheBench, Version 2.3 &lt; $Revision: 1757674 $&gt;Copyright 1996 Adam Twiss, Zeus Technology Ltd, http://www.zeustech.net/Licensed to The Apache Software Foundation, http://www.apache.org/Benchmarking 10.240.0.8 (be patient)Completed 100 requestsCompleted 200 requestsCompleted 300 requestsCompleted 400 requestsCompleted 500 requestsCompleted 600 requestsCompleted 700 requestsCompleted 800 requestsCompleted  ...\n Well - that&#39;s a pretty large difference! Keep in mind that these are on 1vCPU - Nanos has SMP support because even though there are a ton of languages/applications that are inherently single process/single-threaded that&#39;s not what our future holds. Google  actually has support for instances with 416 threads! Holy multi-threading batman.\n  If you are testing and you just run OPS locally without any taps you&#39;ll be using user-mode networking with no hardware acceleration. Both of these will produce far less results than what you see here. That&#39;s why we use gcloud as a neutral testing ground here and since you can upload the image and start the instance in about 2 minutes it&#39;s not really that big of a deal.\n Likewise, measuring something like filesystem writes is not something we&#39;re looking at here. That you&#39;ll need to wait for the next blogpost for!\n Also keep in mind - Nanos is not linux. A lot of people seem to think we&#39;ve trimmed down the linux kernel and created something like Alpine. That is most definitely not what we have done -  go look at the source.\n We are also testing on Google Cloud here. Your results will most assuredly be different on AWS. Again, most of our testing has been done on Google and even though we can deploy to AWS today I am aware of at least one feature that needs to be implemented to make it go much faster than it is doing today. Why the difference? The instances we run on AWS use Xen and the ones on Google are KVM based. Everything from clocks to network drivers to storage is different.\n This is just the start of the performance stuff however it is promising. Some people think that down the road as the codebase grows we will see significant slowdowns. I don&#39;t think this is realistic though as at the end of the day we are comparing a multi-threaded single process system to a system that is not just multiple process but massively multiple processed. They are just two different beasts.\n Plus, there are a ton of optimizations that we have roadmapped that already exist in other general purpose systems such as fbsd and linux that we haven&#39;t even started on yet. A simple scroll through the issue tracker enumerates many of those. So if anything I expect these numbers to improve by a lot. Plus, one of the cooler, imo, things we can do since we know they are unikernels is that we can make app specific optimizations such as subbing out various schedulers  ...\n  Most of the heavy context switching that you read about comes from large many multiple process systems. There are quite a lot of ramifications to software that is written in this style that is sadly just not being taught anymore even though the &#34;hella-core&#34;\u2122 future is extremely important to be aware of.\n For instance remember that a process will share a heap between multiple threads but two processes have to have their own. This is why we see databases and the JVM utilizing things like huge_pages. This is also why forking as a concurrency primitive can be so horribly slow.\n Also, there are a lot of various interfaces in the kernel that are present to facilitate its environment of being a multiple process system and just as many facilities to ensure the concept of multiple users not stomping on each other&#39;s memory. If you have a kernel that is focused on running one and only one application it is no coincidence that it is going to run a lot faster even without tuning. It&#39;s honestly not even fair to compare the two types.\n  Linux has expectations that it could be deployed onto real hardware. We know we will only ever live as a vm and that allows us to take advantage of that fact. Today it is quite possible to run a vm faster than native linux because of how good hypervisors and virtualization have gotten. The hardware being produced today is actually optimized for hyperscaler deployments (eg: running in a virtualized environment).\n Tack on the fact that there are quite a few syscalls we don&#39;t support nor care too and we automatically get performance boosts.\n Then couple with the fact that a brand new instance of debian or ubuntu or whatever comes with all of this:\n    Keep in mind these are processes that are  already running. We haven&#39;t installed  anything yet. This is a fresh boot! This is on a single thread instance!! 93 processes are all fighting each other for that one thread.\n   root@instance -1: /home/eyberg# ps aux | grep pythonroot  1332  0.1  0.5  171708  19432 ?

Let&#39;s not forget that I&#39;m an active user on this system screwing with the performance for every single command I type. We call them &#34;commands&#34; but what are they really? That&#39;s right - yet another program.\n On some of the smaller instances you will be throttled too. The f-1 and g-1 instances for instance are labeled wrong in the gcloud dashboard as &#34;1 vcpu&#34; -  they really are 0.2 and 0.5 respectively and after playing with them enough I feel that the 20% and 50% are bursty all the time. You can really tell the difference between a shared thread and one that is all yours.\n All this is to say that running a general purpose operating system in the cloud works and everyone does it cause it&#39;s the only tools we had.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:45:37", "tags": "linux,faster,\u5185\u6838", "title": "\u6bd4Linux\u66f4\u5feb", "title_en": "Faster Than Linux", "transed": 0, "url":

"note_en": "For those who don\u2019t know, the  OWASP Top Ten is a list of common (web) application security concerns that are frequently referenced within the infosec community. If you\u2019re applying for a position in the industry, more often than not, one of the requirements listed on the job posting will be \u201cfamiliarity with the OWASP Top Ten,\u201d and you can expect to be quizzed on them during a job interview.\n I started out wanting to write this article as an accessible primer featuring clear examples of the Top Ten. While doing research and reviewing the list, I found I didn\u2019t necessarily concur with their breakdown and organization of vulnerabilities and thought it could perhaps be streamlined and modernized.\n Specifically, I saw some redundancy between points  #2,  #3,  #5, and  #6; some that maybe didn\u2019t deserve a dedicated spot ,such as  #4 (XML External Entities); plus some things that appeared to be missing or understated. It seemed like there was some room for a different take on things, at least.\n So instead of writing a primer, I\u2019ve produced my own version of the list in the form of three high-level areas to cover, each with a list of specific threats and steps for mitigation underneath them.\n I believe this approach is a practical and accessible one that acts as a checklist to ensure one\u2019s bases are covered. Even if you won\u2019t be asked the trivia-type question of listing them off during a job interview, they\u2019ll help you give a more holistic answer about how you\u2019d secure a site when asked what your approach would be. Maybe you can impress your interviewer by saying, \u201cSure, I know the Top Ten, but have you heard of Dawe\u2019s Three?\u201d (working title). One can dream.\n  This is a broad category \u2014 it covers OWASP  #1,  #4,  #7,  #8, plus some additional concerns. Input comes in many forms (including literal form submission) and is the primary way in which users interact with your application. Malicious user input, often in the form of code injection or file interaction, is likely the most often exploited attack vector when it comes to web apps.\n There are many types of attacks that fall under this heading, but they all follow the same pattern: unsanitized, unexpected, or mishandled inputs result in a system doing something that it wasn\u2019t intended to, with negative results. Here\u2019s a list of common concerns, which can act as a jumping-off point for further research (just Google the cited item of interest):\n  Input provided into obvious sections of an application, such as input elements, forms, and URL parameters \u2014 GET and POST variables \u2014 that contain snippets of malicious code that\u2019s then executed on the target system or by clients using the service.\n SQL injection: Database queries are manipulated through user-supplied input to extract or tamper with a site\u2019s database\n Cross-site scripting (XSS) family: Client-side code (such as HTML elements and JavaScript) gets added to a site that\u2019s then executed by visitors, often to directly steal their information or trick them into giving it up \u2014 or to trigger operations on their behalf\n  These are easy to overlook because the exploitation path is less obvious. Instead of providing a simple malicious input to a site, the attacks are embedded in things like markup, encoded data, or other more obscure areas of interaction. These types of attacks can lead to lower-level compromises of the underlying system since the involved operations are often more trusted than simple user inputs, and code executed as a result can be very damaging.\n (Un)serialization: Complex (non-primitive) data passed between the client and server or between services is often serialized (\u201cpacked\u201d and \u201cunpacked\u201d) to facilitate the ease of transmission. Because the data, especially in its serialized form, is unreadable to humans, it\u2019s often overlooked as a potential attack vector. Malicious inputs and instructions can be hidden in serialized data that then are processed and executed upon deserialization.\n XML/JSON attacks: Similar to the above point, XML and JSON (the language of the web) can be manipulated by attackers to achieve their goals. Capabilities of the formats can also be exploited in unintended ways \u2014 they\u2019re not just dumb data wrappers. OWASP dedicates an  entire point (#4)to XML-related XXE attacks, which personally I find to be a very fringe consideration not necessarily worthy of a dedicated spot, but as a whole, these types of attacks must be considered. Beware of what may be  ...\n Cookies, session data, and HTTP headers: These are all forms of input that get processed by clients and servers and thus act as an additional attack vector, albeit an obscure and rarely fruitful one. Keep it in mind during parsing.\n  Files (and file access requests) are another type of input that can pose a significant threat to an application. Abusing storage and retrieval functions can lead to a total compromise of a system or disclosure of its contents.\n Directory traversal: In an app that provides file retrieval, especially from the underlying file system (and not a database), the  filename,  path, and related parameters are vectors for malicious input. If you have a script that downloads a file of a given name from a fixed directory, providing  ../../../../secret.txtcan be a way for attackers to access things they shouldn \u2019t. Some misconfigured webservers can also expose this type of threat in a generic sense \u2014i.e., without specifically relating  ...\n Uploading scripts and files: Like above, attackers may target files for replacement when given the ability to upload things to a server. Alternatively, they may upload malicious scripts (such as web shells) to a location above the webroot which they can then run through their browser. Watch those extensions and MIME types!\n Zip bomb: A malicious ZIP file that extracts to a near-infinite size which can cause denial-of-service and resource-exhaustion type attacks\n Zip slip: A malicious ZIP file that replaces files elsewhere on the system during extraction, relying on similar principles to directory-transversal attacks\n  Repeat after me: Sanitize your inputs. Sanitize  all your inputs. Don\u2019t trust them. Get paranoid. Put on a tinfoil hat.\n I\u2019ve given you a list to work from, and researching specific vectors will yield advice on mitigation \u2014 just make sure you\u2019re considering everything that applies to your system. Put yourself in the hacker\u2019s shoes, and think of ways in which input could possibly be abused \u2014 then compensate for it.\n It\u2019s important to remember, anything that\u2019s passed to the server counts as user input, even if there\u2019s no section on the front end for it and it\u2019s processed behind the scenes. Out of sight shouldn\u2019t mean out of mind \u2014 one quick look at the network panel reveals a wealth of potential attack vectors not immediately obvious when practicing defensive security.\n Once you\u2019re screening your inputs like an overzealous TSA worker, it\u2019s time to move on to shoring up the next core function of your system.\n  Trust is a difficult and fragile thing to achieve over the web \u2014 and this challenge scales as more moving parts and systems get involved.\n In an ecosystem populated by SaaS products, third-party APIs, cross-domain traffic, shared authentication providers, and mixed devices and platforms, there\u2019s a lot of room for a missing authentication check or rule in the mix. You have to ensure each resource is only accessible by whoever should be accessing it, and that the communication channels themselves are also secure. This section roughly covers OWASP  #2,  #3,  #5, and  #6.\n  It\u2019s all about how users are allowed to interact with your system. Any point of interaction, if not properly controlled, is a potential source of information disclosure or unauthorized operations.\n Protocol security: The obvious stuff \u2014 and really a precursor to this category. Communications need to be secured using a modern TLS configuration. Your site redirects HTTP to HTTPS appropriately, and there isn\u2019t room for SSL-strip type attacks. Cookies should use the  secure flag where applicable. Without this, attackers can intercept and manipulate your traffic, and efforts taken to enforce authentication and access control will be in vain.\n Authentication and access control: The core concept of the category from which specific threats extend from. Users should be authenticated and resources protected by an appropriate ruleset \u2014 basically, if established identity  x requests resource  y, determine if they\u2019re permitted access it. An oversight here can lead to information disclosure or worse.\n Lack of server-side checks: Attackers can make calls to your server without using your client (web, mobile, etc). This means auth and AC has to be done on the server. A user may have permission to update their bio, but what happens if they post  {\u201cadmin\u201d: true} as part of their update submission, even if there\u2019s no \u201cadmin\u201d checkbox displayed client-side? All endpoints and actions need to be secured (and sanitized, re: malicious inputs) as if the client doesn\u2019t exist.\n Scraping: Modern APIs are very semantically consistent and don\u2019t rely on security by obscurity. Because of this, it\u2019s easy for someone to write a script to request  /record/1, /record/2, \u2026. If an attacker can guess or infer the URL for sensitive information or iterate/brute-force their way to it, you\u2019re at risk for information disclosure.\n Bot mitigations: A source of brute-force and credential stuffing attacks, as well as spam. Use captchas and IP blacklisting where appropriate, like on login and submission forms.\n Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): Imagine you have an endpoint   https://example.com/user/1/delete to delete a user \u2014 what happens if one of your users is tricked into clicking that link through another website or other source? Any action that can be directly called in this manner is at risk of being exploited by attackers working outside your system. Tokenized operations are one way to mitigate this.\n Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and cross-domain attacks:Browsers and apps can make resource requests behind the scenes. When these requests are to a different site (between subdomains or domains, to an API, etc.), certain security rules apply. A misconfiguration of these rules can mean when one of your users visits a malicious site, that site can automatically trigger a request to your own site using your user \u2019s permissions. These rules are tricky to configure, so it \u2019s tempting  ...\n Unnecessary exposure: Anything that doesn\u2019t need to be publicly accessible shouldn\u2019t be. This can include admin panels, testing files and folders, directory indexing,  robots.txtentries for uncrawlable sections, internal services, testing or internal sites and subdomains, and so forth. For hackers performing reconnaissance, the more information, sites, and resources they can glean, the better. Use IP whitelists and password protection on any sensitive internals that are public-facing but  ...\n   Are your communication channels encrypted and secured against eavesdropping, and do your servers enforce proper protocol use?\n It\u2019s about reviewing your system, spotting gaps, addressing them, and then repeating. Think about how information flow is controlled from the protocol level up for all involved systems and resources. When possible, actually simulate testing the threats versus looking at code and configurations \u2014 something may be behaving differently than expected.\n It\u2019s a lot to cover, and making your system airtight is an art. One must also consider what happens when an item is overlooked and things go wrong.\n  Under the broad umbrella of  ops \u2014 DevOps, sysadmin, policies, and procedures \u2014 bad practices and lack of coverage can lead to disaster or make a disaster worse. Every moving part and its (proper or improper) implementation is a potential source of threat, and the plans and practices put into place by an organization serve to mitigate and handle such threats should the need arise. This is where you prepare for success or failure.\n  This will cover OWASP  #9 and  #10 \u2014 if you\u2019re keeping track, those were the two remaining points. It also includes some of the softer considerations around policies and practices that are often underserved when discussing the security of a system. Neglected best practices develop into latent then active dangers to an organization.\n Dependency count: Can you list all the dependencies and technologies your product uses? Having a high number is neither inherently good or bad, but I\u2019m of the opinion that they should be minimized when possible and within reason. What\u2019s more important is that they\u2019re identified and their risks considered through a security lens. For example, If you\u2019re using WordPress \u2014 a ubiquitous, useful, and regularly-targeted CMS \u2014 it (and its plugins) needs regular attention to be made and kept secure.\n Patching: Using out-of-date software with known vulnerabilities is one of the easiest ways to get compromised. Apply your patches! Automatically is preferred, but for production systems, if you\u2019re taking the manual approach, don\u2019t let anything slip through the cracks. Stay up to date on security bulletins for technology in use throughout your organization.\n Securing software and services: Lack of firewall/IDS/IPS coverage and access control gives hackers extra opportunities to breach your systems. Internal and public systems should be isolated or put into a DMZ (when applicable), in case of a partial breach. Lock down anything that doesn\u2019t need to be publicly accessible, and secure what does.\n Logging: A lack of proper logging means two things: the inability to detect potential threats and patterns of malicious actors and the inability to properly respond to a security incident. Logging should be robust, centralized, regularly reviewed, and available when needed to help trace problems.\n Backups (and RAID): An obvious one. You need a copy, in fact, multiple copies (follow the 3\u20132\u20131 rule) of your important data \u2014 otherwise, you face potential data loss, which can be devastating to an organization. Offline backups are a must. Be prepared for physical disasters, hardware failure, accidental deletion, intentional deletion, corruption,  ransomware and cryptolocker attacks, and so on. Backups must be routinely verified, and the restoration process practiced so you \u2019re prepared  ...\n Disaster recovery plan (DRP): Have you considered what \u2019d happen if there \u2019s a fire in your office, your production server gets hacked, your database is leaked to the public, or all your systems get locked down in a ransomware attack? Thinking about and discussing such threats helps you mitigate them before they happen. Having a documented plan means you \u2019re able to respond quickly and efficiently during an emerging crisis when time is of the essence. Creating and regularly maintaining  ...\n  Secure systems, apply patches, and keep and monitor backups and logs. Put policies into place to ensure this is being done. Brainstorm potential threats and disasters to help develop a DRP, and treat it as a living document. Get creative \u2014 ask as many \u201cwhat happens if \u2026\u201d questions as possible. Also, ask \u201cis [this technology] safe to use?\u201d and \u201care we following best practices?\u201d out of habit.\n For routine maintenance, such as checking logs and applying patches, simply using a repeating calendar event and shared reporting document can make sure nothing is left to slide. Assign responsibility to an individual, and follow up with them to ensure things are being done.\n Due diligence and thoughtful preparation will provide security and peace of mind in your organization.\n  As you can see, there are a lot of bases to cover. At a high level, three things need to be done to ensure an app is secure:\n  Those get broken down into the related steps and considerations documented above. This by no means an exhaustive list \u2014 but rather a framework to get you thinking about securing an application from the most common threats. Given the complexity and interplay of technologies in use today, it\u2019s impossible to cover all the potential ways a system may be exploited.\n When securing your application, in particular, think about what you\u2019re doing that isn\u2019t standard, and in that difference, if there are any unique dangers that you may face.\n  Relating this back to OWASP, I\u2019ve covered all the individual points in the Top Ten, plus some additional areas.\n I think three high-level points, each with significant detail underneath, may be an easier-to-remember and more practical framework in comparison.\n I do believe the way I\u2019ve presented this may serve as a more comprehensive checklist-style approach to actually securing an application, versus a simple catalog of certain threats. Ultimately, I think this should act as a useful reference for someone who\u2019s found themselves responsible for securing an application/system \u2014 it\u2019s built from my experience in doing just that for over 10 years, put to paper.\n And if you liked this writeup, I also produced a  ransomware-focused mitigation guide for organizations earlier this year.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:45:31",

"note_en": "I get that people are getting a bit of cabin fever and perhaps that&#39;s impacting people&#39;s outlook on the world, but a recent piece by David Rotman in the MIT Tech Review is truly bizarre. The title gets you straight to the premise:  Covid-19 has blown apart the myth of Silicon Valley innovation. Of course, even the paragraph that explains the thesis seems almost like a modern updating of the famous  &#34;what have the Romans ever done for us?&#34; scene from Monty Python&#39;s  Life of Brian:  ...\n Silicon Valley and big tech in general have been lame in responding to the crisis. Sure, they have given us Zoom to keep the fortunate among us working and Netflix to keep us sane; Amazon is a savior these days for those avoiding stores; iPads are in hot demand and Instacart is helping to keep many self-isolating people fed. But the pandemic has also revealed the limitations and impotence of the world \u2019s richest companies (and, we have been told, the most innovative place on earth) in the face of  ...\n Wait, what? That doesn&#39;t seem &#34;lame&#34; at all. That kinda seems central to keeping much of the world safe, sane, and connected. And the next paragraph seems equally ridiculous:\n Big tech doesn\u2019t build anything. It\u2019s not likely to give us vaccines or diagnostic tests. We don\u2019t even seem to know how to make a cotton swab. Those hoping the US could turn its dominant tech industry into a dynamo of innovation against the pandemic will be disappointed.\n Leaving aside the hilariously wrong &#34;big tech doesn&#39;t build anything,&#34; this paragraph reads like &#34;how dare pharmaceutical companies not build video conferencing software.&#34; Besides, tons of big tech companies are doing a lot (beyond the admitted list above) to help during the pandemic, including Google&#39;s and Apple&#39;s  efforts to help with contact tracing, and then, of course, there are plenty of examples of the big tech companies of Silicon Valley trying to do more to  ...\n   Basically, the entire premise of Rotman&#39;s article makes no sense at all, and he just keeps repeating it like if he says it enough, maybe people will believe him:\n The pandemic has made clear this festering problem: the US is no longer very good at coming up with new ideas and technologies relevant to our most basic needs.\n Except that we are -- as his own article makes clear. The fact that internet companies aren&#39;t magically creating vaccines isn&#39;t a condemnation of Silicon Valley innovation. I mean, at best, you could argue that it&#39;s a failure of big pharma innovation, but it seems a bit early to be saying that one way or another given that we&#39;re just a few months into this thing, and a bunch of innovations that are helping to rapidly create a vaccine, like genetic testing, have also developed  ...\n The only way Rotman supports his premise is to argue that software/internet companies are producing software/internet products, rather than manufacturing physical goods. But, again, that&#39;s like saying &#34;why doesn&#39;t Pfizer create videoconferencing software.&#34; It&#39;s not their business. And, perhaps Rotman should get out of Cambridge and come to Silicon Valley (well, post pandemic) to learn about how there&#39;a a  hardware renaissancehappening in Silicon Valley, in part thanks  ...\n The whole article reads like Rotman had a premise, and then wrote the article despite the near total lack of any actual evidence to support the premise. It&#39;s a bad look for MIT&#39;s Tech Review, but what good has MIT ever brought the world anyway?", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:45:26", "tags": "\u79d1\u6280,tech,companies", "title":

"note_en": "If the 1980s saw the advent of trickle-down economics, the 2020s are witnessing the dawn of flush-down economics. As the coronavirus crisis is making clear, Americans are becoming more dependent on freebies subsidized by venture capitalists and investors. If you \u2019re using Zoom for free, if you have a free subscription to Disney+, or if you \u2019re getting \u201cfree \u201ddelivery from DoorDash, then you are the beneficiary of flush-down economics. What was once the quaint over-spending by so-called unicorns,  ...\n So far, flush-down economics has been a barely noticeable lifestyle boost. It has manifested, for example, in random discounted rides from Lyft and Uber; it has meant an under-enforcement of account-sharing by streaming services like Netflix or Spotify. When retrospectives of the 2010s arrive, they \u2019ll inevitably play scenes of scooters clogging up city sidewalks. Pangs of nostalgia will greet Americans as they reminisce of the simpler, pre-coronavirus days when our biggest concern was Silicon Valley  ...\n The origin of this cash glut comes from the 2008 Recession when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero in a move to stimulate the economy. At that point, the government was effectively giving away money, which led to the most significant injection of cash into corporate America in history. By November of last year, as cited by the Washington Post, corporate debt had swelled to nearly  ten trillion dollars.\n What was meant to be a temporary move has now become business as usual. While the Fed had resumed raising rates in December 2015, they slashed them back to zero in March of this year, when American deaths from the virus surpassed 100.\n The theory of zero interest rates is that easy access to money will encourage companies to invest and thus grow the economy. In practice, we end up with an awkward flurry of so-called unicorns \u2014 companies with billion-dollar valuations \u2014 as well as already grown-up tech companies like Amazon and Netflix, who are out-spending each other in a vain attempt at monopoly.\n  What kinds of freebies can we expect? Delivery services are currently having their moment during the crisis, so investment will likely continue to inflate the GrubHubs and DoorDashes of the world. For example, in the first month that I used DoorDash, I was offered a month of free delivery. When that ended, I went back to DoorDash and signed up for a free trial of their DashPass, which also has free delivery. When my DoorDash freebies end, I will switch to GrubHub and run the cycle all over again.  ...\n It\u2019s not just the delivery space that will see a happy marriage between subsidy and crisis. Teletherapy and telemedicine are booming as everyone shelters-at-home. Enable My Child, for example, has seen a  surge in demand for online pediatric therapyduring the Pandemic. They currently charge $80/hr., which is a discount from brick-and-mortar rates, and which can be explained by the $1.2 million they raised in 2017. We can expect fundraising rounds of $10 \u201350 million for companies like theirs  ...\n Virtual learning was supposed to become the Next Big Thing a few years ago, around the time when Kahn Academy blew up. But maybe that was too early. Students who had attempted to enroll in virtual classrooms over the past decade have occasionally encountered signs saying, \u201cthis classroom is full, \u201dwhich is odd for Internet businesses. Suddenly, post-COVID, the same classrooms can now fit 40,000 students. The next two years will likely determine who will be the e-learning juggernaut, so we  ...\n Innovative brokerage apps like Robin Hood may go beyond zero commissions and offer cash-back on the first hundred trades for new users. Already, they offer new users a free,  single share of a randomly chosen stock. Given they raised nearly a billion in venture capital, they can afford to subsidize user on-boarding. The promise of owning a platform is so tantalizing to venture capitalists that they \u2019ll flush billions down the drain to train consumers on novel ways of spending their time and  ...\n  So far, most of the bounty has concentrated in creative class hot spots. The notion of the creative class is an awkward one, promulgated by urban futurist Richard Florida, who predicted that cities like Austin and Portland would foster artisanal farmer \u2019s markets and local breweries in an attempt to attract new kinds of \u201cknowledge \u201dworkers. What he couldn \u2019t predict was how coveted this demographic would become to unicorns and wannabe unicorns. For example, one summer in the mid-2010s, Lyft  ...\n  What impact do startups have on jobs? Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow at the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard, believes startups create jobs, saying that, \u201cFrom 1977 to 2005, existing companies were net job destroyers, losing 1 million net jobs per year. In contrast, new businesses in their first year added an average of 3 million jobs annually.\u201d However, this statistic, like many labor statistics,  can\u2019t convincingly say that startupslike Uber and Lyft create jobs. If anything,  ...\n Whether there has been an overall increase in jobs or not is debatable, but at the very least, the  kindsof jobs Americans are getting has changed forever. By racing to spend billions, companies like Amazon and Uber have demanded workers fast, with no strings attached, which has led to the on-demand cottage industry. Amazon warehouse workers, for example, are often older adults who spend most of the year living in mobile homes but pick up a few shifts during the holiday season. Conveniently  ...\n Another impact on the labor market, albeit a smaller one, is in creating zero-skill jobs for recent grads. Even though these tech-enabled startups are supposed to scale their operations in the cloud, they still invariably need bodies in the office. These disposable kids \u2014and they \u2019re usually in their low-to-mid 20s \u2014are meant to be hired quickly, with the least amount of risk. The service associates (i.e., receptionists) at WeWork, all seem to have college degrees, which gives them a  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:45:20", "tags": "\u6765\u5230,flush,\u7f8e\u56fd,jobs",

"note_en": "A month ago  I wrote about changes in Internet traffic caused by the COVID-19 emergency. At the time I wrote:\n Cloudflare is watching carefully as Internet traffic patterns around the world alter as people alter their daily lives through home-working, cordon sanitaire, and social distancing. None of these traffic changes raise any concern for us. Cloudflare&#39;s network is well provisioned to handle significant spikes in traffic. We have not seen, and do not anticipate, any impact on our network&#39;s performance, reliability, or security globally.\n That holds true today; our network is performing as expected under increased load. Overall the Internet has shown that it was  built for this: designed to handle huge changes in traffic, outages, and a changing mix of use. As we are well into April I thought it was time for an update.\n  Here&#39;s a chart showing the relative change in Internet use as seen by Cloudflare since the beginning of the year. I&#39;ve calculated moving average of the trailing seven days for each country and use December 29, 2019 as the reference point.\n  On this chart the highest growth in Internet use has been in Portugal: it&#39;s currently running at about a 50% increase with Spain close behind followed by the UK. Italy flattened out at about a 40% increase in usage towards the end of March and France seems to be plateauing at a little over 30% up on the end of last year.\n It&#39;s interesting to see how steeply Internet use grew in the UK, Spain and Portugal (the red, yellow and blue lines rise very steeply), with Spain and Portugal almost in unison and the UK lagging by about two weeks.\n   Similar increases in utilization are seen here. The US, Canada, Australia and Brazil are all running at between 40% and 50% the level of use at the beginning of the year.\n  We measure the TCP RTT (round trip time) between our servers and visitors to Internet properties that are Cloudflare customers. This gives us a measure of the speed of the networks between us and end users, and if the RTT increases it is also a measure of congestion along the path.\n Looking at TCP RTT over the last 90 days can help identify changes in congestion or the network. Cloudflare connects widely to the Internet via peering (and through the use of transit) and we connect to the  largest number of Internet exchanges worldwide to ensure fast access for all users.\n Cloudflare is also present in 200 cities worldwide; thus the TCP RTT seen by Cloudflare gives a measure of the performance of end-user networks within a country. Here&#39;s a chart showing the median and 95th percentile TCP RTT in the UK in the last 90 days.\n  What&#39;s striking in this chart is that despite the massive increase in Internet use (the grey line), the TCP RTT hasn&#39;t changed significantly. From our vantage point UK networks are coping well.\n   The picture here is slightly different. Both median and 95th percentile TCP RTT increased as traffic increased. This indicates that networks aren&#39;t operating as smoothly in Italy. It&#39;s noticeable, though, that as traffic has plateaued the TCP RTT has improved somewhat (take a look at the 95th percentile) indicating that ISPs and other network providers in Italy have likely taken action to improve the situation.\n This doesn&#39;t mean that Italian Internet is in trouble, just that it&#39;s strained more than, say, the Internet in the UK.\n  The Internet has seen incredible, sudden growth in traffic but continues to operate well. What Cloudflare sees reflects what we&#39;ve heard anecdotally: some end-user networks are feeling the strain of the sudden change of load but are working and helping us all cope with the societal effects of COVID-19.\n It&#39;s hard to imagine another utility (say electricity, water or gas) coping with a sudden and continuous increase in demand of 50%.\n  Internet Performance", "posttime":

"note_en": "For months, Elon Musk has been spreading doubt, confusion, and outright misinformation about the deadliest pandemic of our time.\n Since the outbreak began, he\u2019s promoted studies that suggest doctors are  inflating case numbers for financial reasons, or that  the vast majority of fatalities in Italy are due to other causes. He promoted  a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine, which was debunked so quickly that both Twitter and Google Docs refused to host it. In another instance, he  compared the outbreak to  the common cold. On March 6th, he  said simply \u201cthe coronavirus panic is dumb.\u201d  On March 14th, he said  ...\n  Musk has not entirely dismissed the dangers of the outbreak,  recommending that people stay home while displaying symptoms and that the elderly self-isolate. But those measures are far weaker than the prevailing public health guidance, and the overall picture is clear. In every discussion, Musk has taken the side doubting the threat posed by the novel coronavirus and applauded the lifting of restrictions.\n Most recently, Musk\u2019s vigorous skepticism has led him to promote medical misinformation. On Sunday,  he shared a briefing by two Bakersfield doctors who argued that all distancing restrictions should be lifted immediately, claiming that the ongoing outbreak is no worse than a common case of influenza. The claims were quickly and emphatically condemned by a  rangeof medical groups, and YouTube has since removed the video for violating its community guidelines. But Musk has not deleted his tweet,  ...\n Earlier today, Musk tweeted \u201cFree America Now,\u201d an echo of previous tweets from President Trump calling for an end to the various distancing measures. Neither Tesla nor SpaceX responded to inquiries into Musk\u2019s views on the issue.\n Musk\u2019s exceptional success has been built on counterintuitive bets, so when he stakes out an opposing view, people listen. He has legions of fans across the world ready to take his word over anyone else\u2019s. As the world struggles through a grueling and uncertain period of social distancing, those fans now have reason to flout distancing orders and push for premature reopenings, which would almost certainly make the outbreak worse.\n This skepticism has also directly impacted Musk\u2019s stewardship of Tesla. The company\u2019s Fremont factory is subject to an ongoing public health closure from Alameda County, but Tesla  has defied that order twice:first, keeping the factory open for five days after the order was issued, then calling certain employees back to the factory last week. (The company eventually backed down on the second case.) Thus far, the company has avoided any serious repercussions for skirting the public health rules,  ...\n Musk has a combative relationship with his critics \u2014both in the press and in the business world. He \u2019s behaved recklessly in the past and gotten away relatively clean, whether it was his abortive bid to take Tesla private or bizarre feud with a rescue worker in Thailand. But there is more at stake this time, and Musk \u2019s bizarre Twitter habits are more troubling. We desperately need clear-headed guidance from as many corners as possible.

carmaker&#39;s value after tweeting its share price was too high.\n It also knocked $3bn off Mr Musk&#39;s own stake in Tesla as investors promptly bailed out of the company.\n &#34;Tesla stock price too high imo,&#34; he said, one of several tweets that included a vow to sell his possessions.\n In other tweets, he said his girlfriend was mad at him, while another simply read: &#34;Rage, rage against the dying of the light of consciousness.&#34;\n In 2018, a tweet about Tesla&#39;s future on the New York stock market led to regulators fining the company $20m and Mr Musk agreeing to have all further posts on the platform pre-screened by lawyers.\n   On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported it had asked the billionaire if he was joking about the share price tweet and whether it had been vetted, receiving the reply &#34;No&#34;.\n Tesla&#39;s share price has surged this year, putting the electric carmaker&#39;s value at close to $100bn, a mark that would trigger a bonus payment of hundreds of millions of dollars to the entrepreneur.\n   &#34;We view these Musk comments as tongue in cheek and it&#39;s Elon being Elon. It&#39;s certainly a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot button issue and [Wall] Street clearly is frustrated,&#34; Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives told Reuters news agency.\n In 2018, Mr Musk tweeted that he may have secured funding to possibly remove Tesla from the stock market and take it private, which again led to swings in the share price. The Securities and Exchange Commission judged it a market-moving comment, fined him and forced Tesla to put in place checks to ensure it did not happen again.\n But last month, a federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit by shareholders over the going-private tweet, including a claim that Mr Musk intended to defraud them.\n   Earlier this week he tweeted to his 33.4 million followers some strong criticism of US stay-at-home restrictions because of the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019 he found himself in court last year after tweeting that a British diver was a &#34;pedo guy&#34;.\n Mr Musk said the promise to sell his possessions included his house, formerly owned by actor and producer Gene Wilder, and bought in 2013.\n &#34;One stipulation on sale,&#34; he tweeted, &#34;I own Gene Wilder&#39;s old house. It cannot be torn down or lose any of its soul.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:44:58", "tags": "\u57c3\u9686\u00b7\u9a6c\u65af\u514b,\u7279\u65af\u62c9,\u9a6c\u65af\u514b,musk", "title":

final beta version of iOS 13 \u2014 previously numbered \u201c13.4.5.\u201d Today, the company is changing up the beta cycle with the release of iOS 13.5, a revised version that includes the  coronavirus exposure notification system it co-developed with Google.\n Prior to now, features in the new iOS point release were relatively trivial, including an updated music link sharing feature for social networks, and bug fixes. But the addition of the exposure notification tool is significant. It will enable users of both iPhones and Android phones to optionally cooperate in sharing anonymized location data, flagging potential COVID-19 contacts. If a user is diagnosed with the virus, an anonymous notification can be passed on to people who were within Bluetooth  ...\n  Apple and Google have worked aggressively to build trust in their contact tracing solution,  adding more privacy-focused features into the system last week. But it remains unclear  whether a critical mass of users will actually adopt the feature,and whether it will practically deliver positive results. The United States and some EU countries have backed the initiative, accepting the tech companies \u2019approach to user privacy and decentralizing data, while the United Kingdom has signaled that  ...\n   VB Transform 2020 Online - July 15-17, 2020: Join leading AI executives at VentureBeat&#39;s AI event of the year.

Authorized apps will be able to provide notifications if you \u2019ve  ...\n A smaller feature is designed to speed up iOS 13.5\u2019s authentication of users wearing face masks to protect against the virus. iPhones with Face ID will now quickly display the passcode entry screen when a mask is detected, rather than delaying for a full scan attempt.\n Described as \u201cbeta 3\u201d as it\u2019s carrying forward the release cycle from iOS 13.4.5, iOS 13.5 is available now for download from Apple\u2019s developer site, as well as an over-the-air update for iPhones running the prior beta OS. The prior  iOS 13.4 beta cycle took 1.5 months from start to finish, and the final version of iOS  ...\n Apple\u2019s software development tool Xcode 11.5 has also been released with developer API-level support for the feature, and although its iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS operating systems aren\u2019t expected to add contact tracing, they\u2019ve all been bumped to the\u00a0.5 suffix as well.\n Update at 10:30 a.m. Pacific:A private Google Play services update beta is also being released today, enabling some Android Studio developers to begin testing the exposure notification feature. Android devices will not require a full system update; the new feature will be enabled on phones running Android 6.0 or later.  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:44:54", "tags":

"note_en": "The more researchers know about how the coronavirus attaches, invades and hijacks human cells, the more effective the search for drugs to fight it. That was the idea my colleagues and I hoped to be true when we began building a map of the coronavirus two months ago. The map shows all of the coronavirus proteins and all of the proteins found in the human body that those viral proteins could interact with.\n In theory, any intersection on the map between viral and human proteins is a  place where drugs could fight the coronavirus. But instead of trying to develop new drugs to work on these points of interaction, we turned to the more than 2,000 unique drugs already approved by the FDA for human use. We believed that somewhere on this long list would be a few drugs or compounds that interact with the very same human proteins as the coronavirus.\n  Our multidisciplinary team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco,  called the QCRG, identified 69 existing drugs and compounds with  potential to treat COVID-19. A month ago, we began shipping boxes of these drugs off to  Institut Pasteur in Paris and  Mount Sinai in New York to see if they do in fact fight the coronavirus.\n In the last four weeks, we have tested 47 of these drugs and compounds in the lab against live coronavirus. I\u2019m happy to report we\u2019ve identified some strong treatment leads and identified two separate mechanisms for how these drugs affect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings were  published on April 30 in the journal Nature.\n   The map we developed and the FDA drug catalog we screened it against showed that there were potential interactions between the virus, human cells and existing drugs or compounds. But we didn\u2019t know whether the drugs we identified would make a person more resistant to the virus, more susceptible or do anything at all.\n To find those answers we needed three things: the drugs, live virus and cells in which to test them. It would be optimal to test the drugs in infected human cells. However, scientists don\u2019t yet know which human cells work best for studying the coronavirus in the laboratory. Instead we used African green monkey cells, which are  frequently used in place of human cellsto test antiviral drugs. They can be readily infected with the coronavirus and respond to drugs very closely to the way human  ...\n After infecting these monkey cells with live virus, our partners in Paris and New York added the drugs we identified to half and kept the other half as controls. They then measured the amount of virus in the samples and the number of cells that were alive. If the samples with drugs had a lower virus count and more cells alive compared to the control, that would suggest the drugs disrupt viral replication. The teams were also looking to see how toxic the drugs were to the cells.\n  After sorting through the results of hundreds of experiments using 47 of the predicted drugs, it seems our interaction predictions were correct. Some of the drugs do in fact work to fight the coronavirus, while others make cells more susceptible to infection.\n It is incredibly important to remember that these are preliminary findings and have not been tested in people. No one should go out and buy these drugs.\n But the results are interesting for two reasons. Not only did we find individual drugs that look promising to fight the coronavirus or may make people more susceptible to it; we know, at a cellular level, why this is happening.\n We identified two groups of drugs that affect the virus and they do it two different ways, one of which has never been described.\n  At a basic level, viruses spread by entering a cell, hijacking some of the cell\u2019s machinery and using it to make more copies of the virus. These new viruses then go on to infect other cells. One step of this process involves the cell making new viral proteins out of viral RNA. This is called translation.\n When going through the map, we noticed that several viral proteins interacted with human proteins involved in translation and a number of drugs interacted with these proteins. After testing them, we found two compounds that disrupt the translation of the virus.\n The two compounds are called  ternatin-4 and  zotatifin. Both of these are currently used to treat multiple myeloma and seem to fight COVID-19 by binding to and inhibiting proteins in the cell that are needed for translation.\n Plitidepsin is a similar molecule to ternatin-4 and is currently undergoing a  clinical trial to treat COVID-19. The second drug,  zotatifin, hits a different protein involved in translation. We are working with the CEO of the company that produces it to get it into clinical trials as soon as possible.\n    Cell receptors are found both inside of and on the surface of all cells. They act  like specialized switches. When a specific molecule binds to a specific receptor, this tells a cell to do a specific task. Viruses often use receptors to  infect cells.\n Our original map identified two promising  MV cell receptors for drug treatments, SigmaR1 and SigmaR2. Testing confirmed our suspicions.\n We identified seven drugs or molecules that interact with these receptors. Two antipsychotics,  haloperidol and  melperone, which are used to treat schizophrenia, showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Two potent antihistamines,  clemastine and  cloperastine, also displayed antiviral activity, as did the  compound PB28 and the  female hormone progesterone.\n Remember, all these interactions have so far only been observed in monkey cells in petri dishes.\n At this time we do not know exactly how the viral proteins manipulate the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. We think the virus uses these receptors to help make copies of itself, so decreasing their activity likely inhibits replication and reduces infection.\n Interestingly, a seventh compound \u2013 an ingredient commonly found in  cough suppressants, called dextromethorphan \u2013 does the opposite: Its presence helps the virus. When our partners tested infected cells with this compound, the virus was able to replicate more easily, and more cells died.\n  This is potentially a very important finding, but, and I cannot stress this enough, more tests are needed to determine if cough syrup with this ingredient should be avoided by someone who has COVID-19.\n All these findings, while exciting, need to undergo clinical trials before the FDA or anyone else should conclude whether to take or stop taking any of these drugs in response to COVID-19. Neither people nor policymakers nor media outlets should  panic and jump to conclusions.\n Another interesting thing to note is that hydroxychloroquine \u2013 the controversial drug that has shown  mixed results in treating COVID-19 \u2013 also binds to the SigmaR1 and SigmaR2 receptors. But based on our experiments in both labs, we do not think hydroxychloroquine binds to them efficiently.\n Researchers have long known that hydroxychloroquine easily binds to receptors in the heart and  can cause damage. Because of these differences in binding tendencies, we don\u2019t think hydroxychloroquine is a reliable treatment.  Ongoing clinical trials should soon clarify these unknowns.\n  Our idea was that by better understanding how the coronavirus and human bodies interact, we could find treatments among the thousands of drugs and compounds that already exist.\n Our idea worked. We not only found multiple drugs that might fight SARS-CoV-2, we learned how and why.\n But that is not the only thing to be excited about. These same proteins that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect and replicate in human cells and that are targeted by these drugs are also hijacked by  related coronaviruses SARS-1 and MERS. So if any of these drugs do work, they will likely be effective against  COVID-22, COVID-24 or any future iterations of COVID that may emerge.\n  The next step is to test these drugs in human trials. We have already started this process and through these trials researchers will examine important factors such as dosage, toxicity and potential beneficial or harmful interactions within the context of COVID-19.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:44:28", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u6cbb\u7597,treat", "title":

"note_en": "Note: The 2020 lines in the charts are provisional data through April 11. The end of the first week of each month is labeled.\n Total deaths in seven states that have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic are nearly 50 percent higher than normal for the five weeks from March 8 through April 11, according to  new death statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is 9,000 more deaths than were reported as of April 11 in official  counts of deaths from the coronavirus.\n The new data is partial and most likely undercounts the recent death toll significantly. But it still illustrates how the coronavirus is causing a surge in deaths in the places it has struck, probably killing more people than the reported statistics capture. These increases belie arguments that the virus is only killing people who would have died anyway from other causes. Instead, the virus has brought a pattern of deaths unlike anything seen in recent years.\n If you look at the provisional deaths from all causes, death counts in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, Maryland and Colorado have spiked far above their normal levels for the period. In New York City, the home of the biggest outbreak, the number of deaths over this period is more than three times the normal number. (Recent data suggests it could have reached  six times higher than normal.)\n  In New Jersey, deaths have been 172 percent of the normal number so far \u2014 more than 5,000 additional deaths, compared with an average count from the past five years. In Michigan, the partial death count is 121 percent of the count in a normal year, the equivalent of nearly 2,000 more deaths.\n These numbers are preliminary because death certificates take time to be processed and collected, and complete death tallies from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can take up to eight weeks to become final. The speed of that data reporting varies considerably by state. In Connecticut, for example, where reported coronavirus deaths are high, the C.D.C. statistics include zero reported deaths from any cause since Feb. 1, because of reporting lags.\n We compared these provisional death counts with the average number of deaths each week over the past five years. Public health researchers use the term \u201cexcess deaths\u201d to describe a gap between recent trends and a typical level of deaths.\n It\u2019s difficult to know whether the differences between excess deaths and the official counts of coronavirus deaths reflect an undercounting of coronavirus deaths or a surge in deaths from other causes. It\u2019s likely a mix of both.\n  There is evidence, in  New York and other places, that the official coronavirus counts are probably too low. Tests for the illness can be hard to get, and not all who die now are being tested, particularly if they die outside a hospital. New York City  recently revised its own statistics for the number of coronavirus-related fatalities, saying thousands of additional deaths were probably because of Covid-19, even though no tests had been conducted.\n There is also increasing evidence that stresses on the health care system and fears about catching the disease have caused some Americans to die from ailments that are typically treatable. A recent  draft paper found that hospital admissions for a major type of  heart attack fell by 38 percent in nine major U.S. hospitals in March. In a normal year, cardiovascular disease is the country\u2019s leading cause of death.\n Some causes of death may actually be going down. There appear to be  fewer road fatalities in California, as more U.S. residents stay at home, for example. It is possible that those reductions could cancel out coronavirus deaths in places where the virus is not yet widespread. But, in many states, any such reductions have been clearly outweighed by increases in deaths directly and indirectly related to the virus.\n  Demographers often use measures of total deaths, sometimes called all-cause mortality, to evaluate the effects of natural disasters, where it can be difficult to trace particular causes.\n In Puerto Rico in 2017, only  64 deaths were initially attributed to Hurricane Maria. But an analysis of the additional deaths showed the way that the disaster had, directly and indirectly, led to nearly  3,000 deaths over six months. The total included the immediate deaths from mudslides and drownings, but also sepsis, diabetes and suicides that came later as the power failure stretched on for months.\n Coronavirus is clearly killing more U.S. residents directly than any hurricane has, but it is also changing lives in ways that may also contribute indirectly to increased deaths \u2014 by overloading the health care system and discouraging people from seeking care.\n Measures of total deaths are also commonly used in countries without detailed accounting of causes of death. Right now, they are the most useful tool, several epidemiologists said, for measuring the impact of coronavirus in the United States, too.\n \u201cIt gives you an overall sense of how big things are,\u201d said Samuel Clark, a professor of sociology at Ohio State University, whose work is in demography and epidemiology. \u201cFor now, you can basically attribute the excess mortality to Covid-19. But you also grab all the things that are not Covid at all, but are probably created by the situation.\u201d\n  Around the world, the coronavirus is bringing large waves of mortality. In Spain, deaths over the last month are 66 percent higher than normal, according to  New York Times reporting. In Ecuador, they are  more than 80 percent higher than normal. In Paris, more than twice as many people are dying every day as normal \u2014 far more than during a typical bad flu season.\n Eventually, we will get more clarity about all of the reasons that people died this year. While no mortality statistics are ever perfect, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses detailed death certificates to code the causes of death for everyone who dies each year in the United States. But that process typically takes more than a year to complete.\n For now, total deaths are our best glimpse into the ways the coronavirus is affecting the normal patterns of survival.\n Sources:  Centers for Disease Control and P revention (total death numbers);  New York Times database of reports from state and local health agencies and hospitals (coronavirus death numbers); New York City health department (coronavirus deaths for New York City) | Notes: Coronavirus deaths for New York City include both confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19.

To be sure, there have been many talented Swedes deserving of international recognition: August Strindberg, Ingmar Bergman, ABBA, Robyn, Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, the founders of Spotify and Skype, and \u2014of course \u2014Alfred Nobel, just to name a few. Sweden \u2019s generous social welfare system, meanwhile, is often held up by envious American progressives as a model to emulate.  ...\n      With its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, though, Sweden\u2019s upright image has been tarnished. Over the past few weeks, the world has watched as Sweden\u2019s public health agency has largely ignored international scientific consensus on the most efficient and lifesaving response to COVID-19: social distancing. Sweden is the only nation in the group of  more economically developed countriestaking an almost entirely laissez-faire approach to the pandemic. As a native Swede who has been based  ...\n        First, it continues to be very difficult to get tested for COVID-19\u2014both for active infection and for antibodies. The Swedish public health agency Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten has  restrictedtesting priority to hospitalized patients and people who work in health or elderly care \u201cwith suspected COVID-19. \u201dThe agency says that patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms should not be prioritized for testing until they are hospitalized, and it is not prioritizing testing of potentially asymptomatic  ...\n          Just as the U.S. and most of Europe were tightening restrictions, Swedish bar owners were  allowed to open their outside patios  earlier than usual. With some minor exceptions, Swedish bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, clubs, and stores remain open to this day. Sweden\u2019s per capita death rate is now among the highest in the world, above the United States and nearly six times as high as some of our Scandinavian neighbors. Total  deaths from COVID-19 in Swedenare nearing 2,500, more  ...\n  For the most part, Sweden\u2019s citizens\u2014many of whom are passionate supporters of progressive human rights, immigration policies, feminism, and equality culture, and of the country\u2019s famed teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg\u2014have gone along with policies leading to large-scale death.\n        Swedes have done the least in Europe to change their movements according to social distancing,  anonymized mobility data from Google has shown. When I flew into Sweden earlier this month from Los Angeles (a necessary trip\u2014taken while dressed in mask, gloves, and a  Beastie Boys\u2019 \u201cIntergalactic\u201d\u2013type faux hazmat suit), it was like arriving in an alternate universe. No screening of any kind took place. There were no pamphlets about COVID-19 precautions. It was like COVID-19  ...\n  What I quickly noticed during the ride to my Stockholm apartment was how things seemed exactly normal for this time of year. Spring, when the Swede wakes up from his winter depression and goes outside to manically face the sun with closed eyes, was the same as it ever was. No one I could see was minding social distance. Caf\u00e9s were full to the brim, and people were picnicking in parks, on the same blanket. And within the first few hours back in Stockholm, I saw more  ...\n    After spending the past decade as a cultural journalist and TV producer in San Francisco and Los Angeles, I have temporarily moved back to Sweden because I want to be close to my 71-year-old mother during this difficult time (all internationally recommended safety precautions  more than taken). To witness the differences between my home country and my adopted country has been confusing and infuriating.\n        There are a number of explanations for Sweden\u2019s unique approach, but they revolve\u2014I think\u2014around a culture of conformity and the self-image of exceptionalism. Prior to my return, the phrase \u201cWe\u2019re only following recommendations\u201d had been regurgitated to me for two months by Swedish friends. Susan Sontag  once described the Swedish capacity for conformity: \u201cWhenever possible, situations and words are taken at face value. \u201dOften, this has meant listening to  ...\n          State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has been one of the loudest and most trusted voices among the country\u2019s pandemic response team. He has taken an almost lobotomized detachment in discussing the tragic costs of his response plan and refused to take responsibility for the worst outcomes of that plan, blaming elder care facilities for the deaths that have been the inevitable result of the government\u2019s approach.\n  \u201cI think to great parts we have been able to achieve what we set out to achieve,\u201d Tegnell recently told the BBC. \u201cWhat has not worked out very well is our death toll, and that\u2019s very much\u2014I mean, it\u2019s partly due to the strategy, but not really very much. It\u2019s mainly due to that our homes for elderly have not been able to keep the disease out.\u201d\n      Another prominent public voice has been Johan Giesecke, previously at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, currently an adviser to the Swedish public health agency. Giesecke \u2019s hot takes about the Swedish model border on the absurd, with his interviews sprinkled with quotes like \u201cI \u2019ve got a gut feeling about this \u201dand \u201cEvery other country is wrong. \u201dSwedes in general don \u2019t seem troubled by this nonsense; both Tegnell and Giesecke  ...\n  There have been some voices of reason outside of the official government response. Swedish virologist Lena Einhorn \u2014a staunch critic of Tegnell and Giesecke \u2014explained to the BBC why she wanted the country to start bending the curve \u2014to give the health care system time to develop therapeutics and possibly a vaccine. Joacim Rockl\u00f6v, professor in epidemiology at Ume\u00e5 University, and Anders Jansson, a doctor at Danderyd Hospital, have also been  ...\n        Many Swedish pundits have aggressively defended Sweden \u2019s COVID-19 model. A destructive culture of bullying against any journalist \u2014and even scientists! \u2014critical of Sweden \u2019s official response has developed, where editorial writers standing on self-proclaimed platforms of empathetic ideologies have been the most disdainful. Blinded by a sense of invincibility, writers have trashed Sweden \u2019s experts and any critical debate in a pandemic  ...\n    What I haven\u2019t seen much of is rational discussion about why there is such unwavering faith that Sweden\u2019s tiny public health agency could be superior to the collected knowledge about COVID-19 in every other economically developed country. One of the few journalists to ask the critical questions on an ongoing basis has been German TV correspondent Christian Stichler, who in a recent Swedish TV debate said there is a missing  streitkultur  ...\n    There have also sadly been few news stories about the dead and their families, or stories about all the Swedish health care workers who have risked their lives under the ghastly conditions our authorities have left them with. For a country as small as Sweden, that alone should be a national trauma.\n    A handful of writers have provided a few non-trolling critical voices. For instance, Peter Wolodarski, the editor in chief of Sweden\u2019s biggest newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, has not bowed to the opinions of many of his own colleagues.\n  The politics of COVID-19 have felt similarly jumbled. I have seen more correlation between the rhetoric of the Swedish left and Fox News than between the Swedish left and progressive movements internationally. It has been the Swedish left that has fiercely praised the Swedish COVID-19 response with overtones of nationalism. That protests over the lockdowns have popped up across America over the past few weeks is of course not  ...\n    Where have Sweden\u2019s government and Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven been in all of this? L\u00f6fven held one somber, prerecorded five-minute address to the nation last month. It wasn\u2019t exactly impassioned, and it offered very little in the way of an actual plan to stop the spread of the virus.\n      This has all been shattering for an at least temporarily repatriated expat. During my decade in California, Sweden has functioned as a mental support cushion of safety and reason, especially after the still-hard-to-fathom election of the star of  The Apprenticeas president of the United States. I \u2019ve held this faith despite Sweden having its own very visible issues with the far-right: The nationalist far-right-wing Sweden  ...\n    One explanation for Sweden \u2019s unique COVID-19 response has been the high trust Swedes have had in their government, historically. That trust has started to slip in recent years, with a divergence between those supporting the rising far-right and those more committed to Sweden \u2019s historical values. L\u00f6fven was barely able to maintain his position as prime minister after our last election in 2018, and he did so by abandoning  ...\n      The Sweden of my youth, meanwhile, was still steered by the idea of  folkhemmet( \u201cthe people \u2019s home \u201d), developed mainly in the 1930s and 1940s. It offered a safe midway point between socialism and capitalism that attracted many human rights leaders, while avoiding communism \u2019s brutal suppression of individual liberty or the destructive and reckless impoverishment of those deemed \u201closers \u201din cutthroat American  ...\n  \u201cThe people\u2019s home,\u201d though, is also unfortunately very much connected to the guiding Swedish principle of  lagom\u2014just the right amount. What  lagom has come to mean in Sweden during COVID-19 is what it usually means: that no one should stick out (paradoxically this is exactly what Sweden is doing internationally). And  lagomis in turn tied to a culture of conflict avoidance that can be found in quotidian Swedish  ...\n        Many Swedes  do reflect critically over Sweden\u2019s COVID-19 response. And increasingly so. But this period seems likely to become a historical note as shameful as when Sweden let the Germans march through Norway.\n  Sweden\u2019s peculiar cultural attributes, the idea of  lagom, unbounded trust in state experts, and an internalized sense of exceptionalism have mainly served Sweden well. But in a global crisis, they become a liability. It is still possible that Sweden \u2019s COVID-19 response could be exonerated \u2014say, herd immunity does take effect and Sweden \u2019s death rate is lower than neighboring countries \u2019at some point down  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:44:05", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u745e\u5178,sweden", "title": "\u6211\u521a\u56de\u5230\u745e\u5178\u7684\u5bb6\u3002\u6211\u88ab\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u53cd\u5e94\u5413\u574f\u4e86", "title_en": "I Just Came Home to Sweden.

However little has been done to estimate the number of suicides due to the lockdowns.\n Earlier covid-19 death models may have erred too far on the side of caution. On March 16th, the Imperial College published a paper estimating the US deaths due to covid-19 to be 2.2M. [1] This study and others have triggered a series of lockdowns across the nation. As of today, April 29th, CDC forecasts \u201conly\u201d 72k deaths due to covid-19. [2] As 47k people die from committing suicide every year in the US [3], the rise of number of suicides due to covid-19 lockdowns should become a major concern.\n Covid-19 lockdowns can and will trigger more suicides for various reasons but we will focus on the two main ones: - Unemployment due to the covid-19 recession - Isolation due to the covid-19 lockdowns\n During the Great Depression, suicide rates increased by 22.8%. [4] Indeed, being unemployed has been found to increase the odds of committing suicide by 246% to 263% varying on gender and age. [5] Covid-19 job losses are expected to reach 47M people. [6] This alone will translate to an additional 9.6k to 10.7k suicides just in 2020. [10]\n Moreover social isolation is as deadly as unemployment. Being strictly isolated raise all causes of mortality by 60% to 134%. [7] With 85% of the US population under stay-at-home order [8], depending if the lockdowns are 3 months long or up to next year, and 36.48% of the population living alone in 2019 [9], this will translate to another 2.2k to 20.1k additional suicides in 2020.
