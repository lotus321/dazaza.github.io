No loaders. No regex. Ship your docs with a couple of super simple declarations.\n Support for legacy and modern frameworks. Perfect for companies migrating from AngularJS to Vue or React.\n Setup Pitsby is based on two types of file. Choose a technology to see how simple they are.\n Pitsby configuration should be created in the root directory of the project which you want the website will be created for. It\u2019s responsible to tell Pitsby where  *.doc.js files are, among other things.\n You should create one  *.doc.js file per component per engine. If your project makes components available for more than one technology, each of them needs to have its own  *doc.js file.\n Build Once you have set up a  configuration file and, at least, one  documentation file, you can easily generate the website running:\n pitsby build You can see the result serving it with    http-server or any other lib that you prefer:\n http-server ./pitsby\n Watch To keep Pitsby watching the changes that you make on any file listed on on the  configuration file, run:\n pitsby build --watch\n Pitsby is utterly awesome and easy - no more pain while documentating

"note_en": "Today, there are two main ways to run compute workloads on GPU. One is CUDA, which has a fantastic ecosystem including highly tuned libraries, but is (in practice) tied to Nvidia hardware. The other is graphics APIs used primarily for gaming, which run on a wide variety of hardware, but historically offer much less power than CUDA. Also, the tooling for compute in that space is terrible. Historically, a lot of compute has also been done with OpenCL, but its future is cloudy as it \u2019s been officially  ...\n Vulkan has been catching up fast in its raw capabilities, with recent extensions supporting more advanced GPU compute features such as subgroups, pointers, and a memory model. Is it getting to the point where it can run serious compute workloads?\n In this blog post are some initial explorations into implementing  prefix sum on recent Vulkan. I have a rough first draft implementation which suggests that Vulkan might be a viable platform, for a sufficiently persistent implementor.\n  As Hacker News user fluffything points out in  this HN thread on my  Taste of GPU compute talk, prefix sum is an excellent benchmark for evaluating GPU compute languages and runtimes.\n For one, it is useful in and of itself. I use it in  font-rs to integrate fragments of exact-area computations to arrive at the total area coverage for font rendering. It is also used as a primitive in many more operations, including GPU-side dynamic allocation and  compaction.\n For two, it is simple. The sequential version can be expressed in just a handful of lines of code:\n def  prefix_sum ( a ):  s  =  0  result  =  []  for  x  in  a :  s  +=  x  result . append ( s )  return  result\n For three, it is challenging but possible to implement efficiently on GPU. The above code has a strictly sequential dependency, but because addition is associative, it is possible to exploit a great deal of parallelism, and there is literature on that going back decades. Even so, efficiently exploiting that parallelism on GPU requires communication between invocations (\u201cthreads\u201d in more common GPU lingo) and careful attention to the memory hierarchy.\n The generalization of prefix sum is called \u201cscan,\u201d and works with any associative operation, not just addition. It doesn\u2019t even have to be commutative; examples of that include  regular expressions and  IIR filtering. More precisely, a scan can be done with any  monoid, a structure with an identity element as well as the associative operation; the identity element is required for the \u201cexclusive\u201d variant of scan, as it is the first element of the output.\n  The state of the art is  decoupled look-back. I\u2019m not going to try to summarize the algorithm here, but recommend reading the paper. The results are impressive \u2014 for large data sets, they report reaching memcpy speeds, meaning that no further speedup is possible.\n That work is a refinement of  Parallel Prefix Sum (Scan) with CUDA from Nvidia\u2019s GPU Gems 3 book. A production-quality, open source implementation is  CUB. Another implementation, designed to be more accessible but not as optimized, is  ModernGPU scan.\n My own  implementation is very much a research-quality proof of concept. It exists as the  prefix branch of the  piet-gpurepository. Basically, I wanted to determine whether it was possible to come within a stone \u2019s throw of memcpy performance using Vulkan compute kernels. It \u2019s a fairly straightforward implementation of the decoupled look-back paper, and doesn \u2019t implement all the tricks. For example, the look-back is entirely sequential; I didn \u2019t parallelize the look-back as suggested  ...\n The implementation is enough of a rough prototype I don \u2019t yet want to do careful performance evaluation, but initial results are encouraging: it takes 2.05ms of GPU time to compute the prefix sum of 64Mi 32-bit unsigned integers on a GTX 1080, a rate of 31.2 billion elements/second. Since each element involves reading and writing 4 bytes, that corresponds to a raw memory bandwidth of around 262GiB/s. The theoretical memory bandwidth is listed as 320GB/s, so clearly the code is able  ...\n  One of the achievements of \u201cmodern C++\u201d is the C++11 memory model. In the olden days, the mechanism for lock-free programming patterns in C and C++ was the  volatile qualifier and various nonstandard barrier intrinsics. People reasoned about these operationally \u2014 the primary function of  volatile was to disable certain optimizations, and the barrier intrinsics compile to a memory fence instruction, which generally cause hardware to flush caches.\n Today, most lock-free aficionados consider those times to be barbaric. The semantics of  volatile were never clearly defined for the purpose of multithreading (though people used it anyway, because it appeared to be useful), and the barrier instructions had the disturbing property of being hardware specific. Because x86 has \u201ctotal store order,\u201d barrier instructions are generally not needed for  publication safety. However, the same code on, say, ARM, which has more weakly ordered memory  ...\n With the C++11 memory model, the programmer specifies the needed ordering constraints precisely. The compiler can then optimize the program very aggressively, as long as it meets those constraints. For example, acquire and release semantics (the basis of publication safety) will compile to explicit memory fence instructions on ARM, but to nothing on x86. A good writeup is the blog post  C++ atomics and memory ordering.\n The new  Vulkan memory modelbrings the same idea to GPU compute. I used it in my code, in large part because I wanted to experiment with it. I \u2019ve done a fair amount of lock-free code using the C++ memory model. And lock-free code, while fairly rare on the CPU (my main motivation is to avoid priority inversion for real time audio), is more or less required on the GPU, because mutex is not available in kernel code. Even if it were, it would create a lot of problems, as it would block  ...\n Is a memory model absolutely required to run this code? If you replace the atomic loads and stores with simple array accesses, it deadlocks. However, at least on my hardware, correct operation can be recovered by adding the  volatile qualifier to the  WorkBuf array. As with older style C++, there are two risks. Though it seems to work reliably and efficiently on my hardware, it\u2019s possible the  volatilequalifier and explicit fences cause more cache flushing than is needed, or suppress  ...\n We\u2019re already seeing variation in hardware that requires different levels of vigilance for memory semantics. On most GPU hardware, the invocations (threads) within a subgroup (warp) execute in lock-step, and thus don\u2019t require any synchronization. However, as of Nvidia Volta, the hardware is capable of  independent thread scheduling. Correct code will add explicit memory semantics even within a subgroup, which will, as in total store order on x86, compile to nothing on hardware  ...\n In my research for this blog post, I did not come across any evidence of people actually using the Vulkan memory model, i.e. no search hits for the relevant identifiers other than work associated with the spec. Thus, one contribution of this blog post is to show a concrete example of code that uses it.\n  On GPU, it\u2019s easiest to run workloads that use static allocation, for example a fixed size buffer per workgroup, and workgroups arranged in a 2D grid (\u201cdispatch\u201d operations support 1D and 3D as well). But dynamic allocation is possible, with care.\n The two major approaches to dynamic allocation are prefix sum and atomic bump allocation. The main reason for one over the other is whether you care about the ordering. Let\u2019s take a simple problem of computing some function on an array of input values, where the output is variable sized.\n Using a prefix-sum approach, you run a first pass of computing the size of the output. The prefix sum of that result yields an offset into an output buffer. The second pass (after the prefix sum) computes the function and writes it into the output buffer, using the offset provided by the prefix sum. [Also note that if we \u2019re getting really fancy, it might be possible to fuse either or both of these passes with the prefix sum itself, decreasing the amount of global memory  ...\n An atomic bump allocation approach simply does   atomicAdd on each output, using a bump allocation index (effectively a pointer) as the first argument and the size of the allocation as the second. This yields results broadly similar to the prefix sum approach, but with the outputs in arbitrary order. Perhaps the order is not important, or, alternatively, a sort pass can be applied afterwards (sorting on GPU is another topic with a rich literature).\n The two can be combined. For example, it makes sense to do a prefix sum of the sizes of items within a workgroup, and a single atomic bump allocation for the per-workgroup total.\n One problem that might benefit from prefix sum for dynamic allocation is  flattening B\u00e9zier curves to polylines. Each B\u00e9zier segment can be computed in parallel, but you generally want to preserve the order of segments within the full path. The flattening algorithm I presented in that blog post (and its  generalization to cubics) fits nicely into this framework \u2014it \u2019s already in two passes, where the first computes the number of segments required, and the second can compute  ...\n  High performance prefix sum requires coordination between threads \u2014 it\u2019s possible to extract some parallelism by running O(log n) tree reduction passes, each of which pulls only from the previous pass, but this would be considerably slower than state of the art. Coordination must be at all levels of the hierarchy. GPU compute has always made threadgroup shared memory available for such coordination. An even faster but newer capability is  subgroups, not yet universally  ...\n My prototype code uses subgroups extensively. One serious limitation is that it assumes a subgroup size of 32, which is true for some hardware. However, other hardware has different size subgroups, and then Intel is special.\n By default, when compiling a compute kernel, the Intel drivers use a  heuristicto determine the subgroup size, which can then be 8, 16, or 32. It actually makes sense they use a heuristic, as there \u2019s a complex tradeoff. A bigger subgroup means bigger chunks of work, which means less per-chunk overhead, but also fewer registers available per thread, and potentially more wasted work due to divergence. Again, that depends on workloads. For low-probability, expensive conditional  ...\n It might be  possible to write a kernel that adapts to subgroup size, but there are a number of considerations that make this tricky. One is whether the number of items processed by a workgroup adapts to subgroup size. If so, then the size of the dispatch must be adapted as well. There is an  extensionfor the CPU side to query subgroup size of a pipeline, but, sadly, it doesn \u2019t seem to be implemented on Intel drivers on Windows, where it would be most useful. (It is,  ...\n Another problem is querying the subgroup size from inside the kernel, which has a surprising gotcha. By default, the  gl_SubgroupSize variable is defined to have the value from  VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupProperties, which in my experiment is always 32 on Intel no matter the actual subgroup size.\n Newer (Vulkan 1.2) Intel drivers offer the ability to both accurately query and control over the subgroup size, with the  VK_EXT_subgroup_size_control extension. With that extension, setting the  VK_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_ALLOW_VARYING_SUBGROUP_SIZE_BIT_EXT at pipeline creation time makes  gl_subgroupSizebehave as expected. Also, I can set the subgroup size to 32, and the kernel works fine. Note though that in general, setting a too-large subgroup size can actually  ...\n On RDNA-based AMD cards, the subgroup size extension lets you get subgroups of 32 on RDNA-based AMD cards, though the default is 64.\n In practice, the programmer will write multiple versions of the kernel, each tuned for a different subgroup size, then on CPU side the code will query the hardware for supported subgroup sizes and choose the best one that can run on the hardware. Note that, in general, querying the range of supported subgroup sizes requires the subgroup size extension to be reliable, though you do string-matching on the device name to come up with a good guess. Note that the  specialization  ...\n Brian Merchant has done more exploration into the tradeoff between subgroups and threadgroup shared memory, for a different primitive operation, transpose of 32x32 boolean matrices. That  transpose timing writeup contains measurements on a variety of hardware, and is recommended to the interested reader.\n  The  subgroupInclusiveAdd function seems like it\u2019s doing a lot \u2014 it\u2019s performing a prefix sum operation on an entire subgroup\u2019s worth of data. Does hardware contain an assembly instruction that directly implements it? What if you want to do an operation other than addition, where there isn\u2019t an intrinsic available?\n Obviously different hardware will be different, but looking at the Radeon GPU Analyzer output on  Shader Playground tells us a lot. It generates a tree reduction (the Hillis-Steele algorithm as presented in the  prefix sum Wikipedia page) with lg(n) stages of subgroup shuffle + add. Since subgroup shuffle is available in Vulkan (but see below), if you were to write out such a reduction you\u2019d be able to get similar results.\n On AMD hardware there is one additional twist:  AMD has an additional level of hierarchy between subgroup (64 invocations, 1 wavefront) and invocation (thread). Internally, the hardware is organized around a  row of 16 elements. Access to elements within a row uses a different instruction modifier ( row_shr) than across the entire wave ( row_bcast or  wave_ror, for two examples), and is likely lower latency in the chip. The Vulkan subgroup extensions provide a powerful  ...\n  It is tempting to use a portability layer such as gfx-hal to run compute workloads on a variety of graphics APIs. (Other such portability layers include MoltenVK for running Vulkan on top of Metal, and similar work for running  OpenCL on DX12). But such an approach is limited to the lowest common denominator \u2014 it can\u2019t provide capabilities that are missing in the underlying layer.\n   Also note that gfx-hal currently doesn\u2019t give access to Shader Model 6 intrinsics (subgroup operations), but there\u2019s an  issue and hopefully that will be fixed.\n  Metal is closer to Vulkan in capabilities (especially newer versions), but still lacks subgroup size control and a memory model.\n  I covered a fair number of GPU compute infrastructure projects in my talk and the associated  GPU resources list. Since then I\u2019ve learned of quite a few more:\n vuda, which runs (SPIR-V) compute workloads using an API similar to the CUDA host API.\n    OpenCL 3.0 is announced, with a number of strategies to rescue OpenCL from a fate of irrelevance.\n I am also optimistic about  WebGPU becoming a viable platform for compute workloads, both delivered over the web and in native implementations such as  wgpu.\n Echoing fluffything\u2019s comment, I propose adopting prefix sum as something of a \u201chello world\u201d benchmark of GPU compute. It\u2019s simple enough it should be practical to implement without too much effort (and if not, that\u2019s also an important data point), it exercises \u201cadvanced\u201d features such as subgroup shuffles, and it\u2019s reasonably easy to quantify. When looking at these potential infrastructure projects, ask these questions:\n  The result of my explorations on Vulkan suggest (but do not yet prove) good answers to these questions, but at the expense of doing a lot of the low-level legwork yourself, and programming the kernel in a very low-level style (in GLSL). I think there\u2019s a huge opportunity for more sophisticated tools.\n Also, I think it\u2019s a great benchmark for the emerging field of GPU-friendly languages. Is it possible to express the algorithm in a reasonably high-level manner? If so, does it compile to code with competitive performance? Can we write a high-performance abstraction as a library that can be consumed easily? Can that abstraction offer portability across hardware but hide the complexity from its users? Can you provide your own monoid?\n  I \u2019ve showed that Vulkan can do prefix sum with near state of the art performance. However, I \u2019ve also outlined some of the challenges involved in writing Vulkan compute kernels that run portably and with high performance. The lower levels of the stack are becoming solid, enabling a determined programmer to ship high performance compute across a wide range of the hardware, but there is also an opportunity for much better tooling at the higher levels.  ...\n Thanks to Brian Merchant, Matt Keeter, and msiglreith for discussions on these topics, and Jason Ekstrand for setting me straight on subgroup size concerns

said that &#34;foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in the United States bulk-power system.&#34;\n The US president said that successful attacks against the US power grid would &#34;present significant risks to our economy, human health and safety, and would render the United States less capable of acting in defense of itself and its allies.&#34;\n The White House argued that equipment made outside the US could be manipulated by foreign adversaries to insert and later exploit vulnerabilities in electrical equipment &#34;with potentially catastrophic effects.&#34;\n Besides barring power grid operators from buying and installing new foreign equipment, the order also authorizes the Secretary of Energy to start procedures to identify current electrical equipment manufactured outside the US and develop strategies with government agencies and the private sector to have it isolated, monitored, and eventually replaced in the future.\n    Despite President Trump citing hacking threats as a primary reason for signing the new order, the US has not seen any destructive attacks from foreign hackers until now.\n   Instead, the US power grid ecosystem has been the target of constant reconnaissance operations from foreign hackers, with Russian threat actors being the most persistent.\n In 2018, the Department of Homeland Security issued a security advisory about increased  Russian cyber-operations targeting the US energy sector.\n In 2019, unknown hackers  used a simple denial of service (DoS) flaw to reboot firewalls at an electric power grid operator for hours, but they did not breach the operator&#39;s internal network to alter power grid parameters.\n Earlier this year, in January, the Federal Bureau of Investigations sent

"note_en": "This blog post discloses a sandbox escape on macOS. I reported the issue to Apple Product Security on December 19 2019, the day the Apple Security Bounty program finally opened. (I discovered the issue in August 2019.) Today I received an email from Apple Product Security saying &#34;we do not see any actual security implications.&#34; I&#39;ve heard this kind of response  before\u2014they don&#39;t see any security implications \u2026until they do \u2014but in any case I obviously won&#39;t be receiving a bounty  ...\n Attached is a sample Xcode project that demonstrates how a sandboxed Mac app can escape the sandbox with one click. This sandbox escape works on the current public shipping version macOS 10.15.2. I&#39;ve also tested on macOS 10.14.6.\n To reproduce, build and run the sample app. Then click to allow when the system dialog asks if the sample app can control TextEdit via Apple Events. This will allow the sample app to create a file named &#34;escaped&#34; in the directory &#34;/Users/Shared&#34;, outside the sandbox. You&#39;ll also hear the app say &#34;hi&#34; to signal that it&#39;s successfully escaped the sandbox. The sample app has actually launched a shell script, &#34;test.sh&#34;, which can run any arbitrary code outside the sandbox.\n The sandbox escape is made possible by the entitlement &#34;com.apple.security.files.user-selected.executable&#34; possessed by TextEdit. It&#39;s also possessed by some Mac App Store apps such as BBEdit. (Note that while TextEdit and BBEdit are themselves sandboxed, this entitlement would also allow them to escape their own sandbox. Thus, any app with the &#34;com.apple.security.files.user-selected.executable&#34; entitlement is only nominally sandboxed, effectively not sandboxed.)\n Normally, when a sandboxed app writes to a file, the file is quarantined. If the file is a shell script, then the quarantine extended attribute would prevent the script from running. However, when an app such as TextEdit with the &#34;com.apple.security.files.user-selected.executable&#34; entitlement saves a file, it removes the quarantine extended attribute!\n My sample app opens a shell script in TextEdit, and then it uses the Apple Events permission to tell TextEdit to save the file, thus removing the quarantine and allowing the script to be executed outside the app&#39;s sandbox.\n This should appear very innocuous to the user, because nobody thinks that TextEdit is dangerous, so one would think it&#39;s not much of a risk to allow TextEdit to be controlled.\n Note that I chose the directory  /Users/Shared to avoid macOS &#34;privacy protections&#34; that prevent interaction with various other directories such as Desktop, Documents, and Downloads. Note also that this issue (if you consider it an issue) still exists on the latest version 10.15.4 of macOS.\n  I&#39;ve written a  new blog post that attempts to clarify a number of issues raised

"note_en": "On March 23, U.S. stock markets closed the day after a multi-week plunge of nearly 30%. This drop coincided with a wave of lockdowns across the country, as well as similar moves throughout Europe, Latin America and South Asia. Since then, the U.S. economy has been in free-fall, with more than 26 million people filing for unemployment, waves of retail stores on the edge of bankruptcy, energy and oil companies teetering on the brink, travel grounded, and the GDP was down 4.8% in the first quarter  ...\n  What is going on? How can it be that stocks are soaring when the economy is crashing? Market movements are often head-scratching, but in this case, the answer may be relatively simple: because of moves by the Federal Reserve, financial markets are awash in money, vast, water-hose supplies of money. Since March, the Fed has committed to lend or buy trillions of dollars of financial assets, which by  some estimatesmight end up exceeding $8 trillion dollars by the time all is said and done. No one  ...\n      And it\u2019s not just the Fed. Congress has allocated almost $3 trillion in economic aid; the Bank of Japan is doing much the same as the Fed for the world\u2019s third largest economy; the European Central Bank is not far behind, and multiple governments around the world are following suit.\n  The result is that even as real-world economies freeze and implode in the short-term, financial markets are buoyed by a tsunami of liquidity.\n  That troubles many investors, who see either sharp spikes of inflation or dire reckoning ahead for stocks and bonds. Respected investor Jeffery Gundlach, one of the most influential bond managers,  warned this week that markets will soon head south fast and the people should be more \u201cwary of panaceas.\u201d Analysts at Bank America  positthat the recent market strength is simply a dead-cat bounce like what happened in 2008 before a more intense crash later that year. Others believe that all  ...\n    And yet, there is something else going on that should give pause to the belief that market strength is a head fake. If it were only about a sea of money floating everything, then you would think that stocks across the board would be going up. That is not the case.\n  In fact, there is a dramatic difference in how individual companies are faring that reflects a cold-eyed assessments of how they will do in a pandemic world. Companies that are seen as especially vulnerable, such as retail stores spread across malls, are seeing stock declines of 50% and have only recovered marginally since March 23. The Gap, Macy \u2019s, Michael Kors, all face daunting prospects, and no amount of liquidity in financial markets will paper that over. Energy companies,  ...\n      On the flip side, clear beneficiaries of the current upheaval are doing well. Five mega-tech companies \u2013 Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Google \u2013 alone make up $5 trillion of market cap, and Amazon in particular has seen its stock go  up more than 30% since mid-March. Costco and Clorox have seen booming business along with Walmart, as has the video conference company Zoom.\n    So while markets are not moving on real-time economic fundamentals, they are moving on reasonable judgements of fundamentals going forward and distinguishing between industries that look to be hardest hits from those that might even benefit from the dramatic economic dislocations that COVID-19 responses are creating. If everything were going up indiscriminately, that would indicate markets were fully detached. There are not.\n  And for those who \u2013understandably \u2013might see all of this as yet further proof that once again, the financial world will get saved at the expense of tens of millions of real people and millions of small companies will get sacrificed, this time it is different. The Fed, for instance, is committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars of municipal bonds at favorable rates, which will mean that cash-strapped state governments should be able to retain teachers and policemen  ...\n  So while it appears crazy that markets are doing relatively well as the world economy burns down, there is a method to the madness that reflects some potentially positive realities of an otherwise dire time. That may be small comfort just now, but it is a clear reminder that as bad as things are just now, they actually could be considerably worse.\n      Check the box if you do not wish to receive promotional offers via email from TIME.\n  You can unsubscribe at any time.

"note_en": "\u201cS   \u201d, urged a sign at a protest against Tennessee \u2019s lockdown on April 20th \u2014though whether the person holding it was trolling the other protesters is unknown. Some claim social distancing is pointless, since covid-19 \u2019s elderly victims would soon have died of other causes. In Britain many pundits have said that two-thirds of the country \u2019s dead were already within a year of passing away. They cite an estimate made in March by Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London who advises  ...\n Mr Ferguson notes that two-thirds was the upper bound of his estimate, and that the real fraction could be much lower. He says it is \u201cvery hard\u201d to measure how ill covid-19\u2019s victims were before catching it, and how long they might have lived otherwise. However, a study by researchers from a group of Scottish universities has attempted to do so. They found that the years of life lost ( s) for the average Briton or Italian who passed away was probably around 11, meaning that few of covid-19 \u2019s victims  ...\n First the authors analysed data for 6,801 Italian victims, grouped by age and sex for confidentiality. About 40% of men were older than 80, as were 60% of women. (The virus has killed fewer women than men, perhaps because they have different immune responses.) The authors excluded the 1% of victims under 50. Then they calculated how much longer these cohorts would normally survive. Life expectancies for old people are surprisingly high, even when they have underlying conditions, because many of  ...\n Then the authors accounted for other illnesses the victims had, in case they were unusually frail for their age. For 710 Italians, they could see how many had a specific long-term condition, such as hypertension or cancer. The authors used a smaller Scottish sample to estimate how often each combination of diseases occurs among covid-19 victims. Finally, they analysed data for 850,000 Welsh people, to predict how long somebody with a given age and set of conditions would normally live.\n    Strikingly, the study shows that in this hybrid European model, people killed by covid-19 had only slightly higher rates of underlying illness than everyone else their age. When the authors adjusted for pre-existing conditions and then simulated deaths using normal Italian life expectancies, the  s dropped just a little, to 11.1 for men and 10.2 for women. (They were slightly lower for Britons.) Fully 20% of the dead were reasonably healthy people in their 50s and 60s, who were expected to live  ...\n The researchers warn that their data exclude people who died in care homes, who might have been especially sickly. Nor can they account for the severity of underlying illnesses. For example, covid-19 victims might have had particularly acute lung or heart conditions. More complete data could produce a lower estimate of  s. Mr Ferguson also points out that tallies of all-cause mortality will contain clues. If the pandemic has merely hastened imminent deaths, there should be fewer than usual once  ...\n Still, the available evidence suggests that many covid-19 victims were far from death\u2019s door previously, and cut down at least a decade before their time. Allowing the virus to spread freely would sacrifice the strong as well as the weak.  \u25a0\n Sources: &#34;Covid-19 \u2013 exploring the implications of long-term condition type and extent of multimorbidity on years of life lost: a modelling study&#34;, by P Hanlon, F Chadwick, A Shah et al., 2020; Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (Italy); SAIL Databank (Wales); Public Health Scotland\n  This article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline &#34;Before their time&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:57:19", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005,died,victims", "title": "\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u8fd9\u79cd\u75c5\u6bd2\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u4f1a\u5f88\u5feb\u6b7b\u4ea1\u5417\uff1f", "title_en": "Would most Covid-19 victims have died soon, without the virus?", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/05/02/would-most-covid-19-victims-have-died-soon-without-the-virus", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005", "died", "victims"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000189, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u60f3\u8c61\u4e00\u4e0b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u3001\u5236\u9020\u5546\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u521b\u9020\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230Pop\uff01_OS\u3002", "note_en": "Imagine an OS for the software developer, maker and computer science professional who uses their computer as a tool to discover and create.

"note_en": "In the early 2000s, Brandon Sandmaier worked as a heavy-duty mechanic in Canada \u2019s tar sands, the world \u2019s largest industrial project, located in northern Alberta. He built pipelines and repaired 400-ton trucks that haul thick, oily bitumen through the open-pit mines. But after more than 10 years in the oil and gas industry, Sandmaier went back to school to study alternative energy in 2014. He knew he wanted to eventually start his own business and he saw potential for growth in solar. He now  ...\n Jake Kubiski was working as an electrician in Alberta \u2019s oil industry when he went on vacation to Costa Rica in 2015 and saw how renewable energy was booming there. Returning home, he decided to start a clean energy business in Alberta, where the industry was still nascent. Now the owner and CEO of Kuby Renewable Energy, an Edmonton-based solar contractor, he has hired about 10 staff with work experience in the fossil fuel industry. \u201cAlberta oil and gas field employees are extremely well-trained,  ...\n Sandmaier and Kubiski\u2019s businesses are part of a growing renewable energy sector in Alberta \u2014 unlikely shoots of life in a province that has been described as a petrostate. For decades, Alberta\u2019s economy was dominated by the exploitation of viscous bitumen in its vast tar sands, which hold the world\u2019s  third-largest oil reservesbehind Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. But since oil prices crashed in 2014, about 35,000 jobs in Alberta \u2019s tar sands have been lost, likely for good. Now, the Canadian  ...\n    As Alberta \u2019s oil and gas industry comes to grips with a long-lasting downturn, workers in the oil industry are beginning to look to the renewable energy sector to make up for the jobs being shed in the tar sands. A handful of nonprofit and economic development agencies are starting retraining programs to prepare former oilfield hands to work in solar and wind power. \u201cMost of the workers that reach out to us have been through boom-bust cycles once, twice, three times, \u201dsays Andrea Visser,  ...\n Sandmaier says more oil workers are reaching out to him to explore working in renewables. \u201cIf presented with an opportunity,\u201d he says, \u201cthey would take it.\u201d\n Rod Wood, national representative for the labor union, Unifor, which represents many oil and gas workers in Alberta, says that although there are a few forward-looking people in the energy industry, many remain resistant to change. But he says that as the tar sands industry continues to be buffeted and as the fight to slow climate change gathers momentum, an energy transition is inevitable. \u201cThe transition is going to occur, \u201dsays Wood, whether Albertans are ready for it or not. \u201cI think  ...\n Around 10 percent of Alberta\u2019s electricity generation currently comes from renewable energy sources, according to the  Canada Energy Regulator. However, renewables are growing fast: From 2005 to 2018, Alberta\u2019s installed renewable electricity capacity  nearly doubled, from 1,484 megawatts to 2,825 megawatts. More than 1,300 megawatts of renewable energy projects are now under construction in the province.\n     The Alberta government says that  8,100 people in the province work as solar installers and  3,200 people as wind turbine technicians. By one estimate, direct and indirect employment in Alberta\u2019s renewable energy sector totals  26,000 jobs, and two consulting firms,  Solas Energy Consulting and  the Delphi Group, forecast that as many as 20,000 new jobs may be created in Alberta\u2019s renewable energy sector by 2030. As of 2018, Alberta\u2019s oil and gas industry employed  153,000 people, a number that  ...\n Programs to retrain oil and gas workers are getting underway, albeit slowly. A non-profit corporation, Calgary Economic Development, recently started a U.S. $1.1 million program to transition unemployed oil and gas professionals to jobs in digital technology, such as software development and programming, which can be used in a variety of energy industries. And Iron &amp; Earth is rolling out three programs to train oil and gas workers in solar and wind energy later this year. The group  ...\n     Oil has long been the lifeblood of Alberta\u2019s economy. In 2018, the oil sands produced  2.9 million barrels per day, about two-thirds of Canada \u2019s total production. In the early 2000s, people from across the country flocked to Fort McMurray, the epicenter of the oil sands boom, to make six-figure salaries. Tar sands companies could not find enough workers. Then, oil prices crashed in 2014 and stayed low, in part because of the fracking boom south of the border in the United States. More  ...\n Those jobs are likely not coming back, according to Ian Hussey, research manager at the Parkland Institute, who wrote the report. Facing tighter budgets, oil companies have changed the way they operate to reduce costs. Suncor, an oil sands mining company, eliminated all drivers that operate massive haul trucks in one of its mines in 2018 and replaced them with driverless trucks. The company is now replicating that model at its other mines and is expecting to cut 400 drivers by 2023.  ...\n    As pressure grows to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, forces from outside Alberta are also threatening the oil sands, whose thick bitumen requires an extraction and refining process that produces more greenhouse gases than conventional oil. In recent months, major financial institutions \u2014 from Sweden\u2019s central bank to the world\u2019s largest asset manager, Blackrock \u2014 have  shifted away from investing in Alberta\u2019s fossil fuel industrydue to its climate impacts. And in February, Teck  ...\n The global economic recession created by the coronavirus has further darkened the outlook for the tar sands industry. As companies slash their spending and delay projects, Alberta\u2019s oil and gas sector is seeing hundreds of layoffs and thousands of jobs put on hold.\n While the majority of oil workers are not eager to switch careers, many see the writing on the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that they work in an industry that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d says Jamie Kirkpatrick, program manager at  Blue Green Canada, an alliance among labor unions, environmental groups, and civil society organizations that advocates for working people and the environment. However, he says, switching to other sectors can be unappealing since it often means taking a sizeable  ...\n While acknowledging the contribution of fossil fuels to people \u2019s livelihoods, Iron &amp; Earth is heading campaigns asking for federal and provincial government support to retrain fossil fuel workers and create more jobs in renewable energy. More than 5,000 people have signed the organization \u2019s pledge to \u201cstand with fossil fuel workers calling for training in renewable energy. \u201dIron &amp; Earth has already retrained a small number of fossil fuel workers and members of the Louis  ...\n     The Calgary Economic Development project is aimed at transitioning displaced oil and gas professionals, such as engineers and geoscientists, into the technology sector. The federally funded project is focused on Calgary, a hub for major oil companies that has been hit hard by the oil downturn. The program, which offers six months of free training, accepted 50 students in its first round, although 500 people applied. Another 50 students will take part in a second round of training  ...\n The previous left-of-center Alberta government bolstered clean-energy growth by pledging to generate 30 percent of the province\u2019s electricity from renewables by 2030. The province provided incentives to homeowners and businesses for solar installation and held three auctions for renewable power projects in 2017 and 2018, leading to the ongoing construction of 1,360 megawatts of renewable energy capacity.\n However, the current conservative government scrapped these programs when it came to power last year. Estimates now are that by 2030 renewables are likely to provide 19 percent of the province\u2019s electricity, doubling current generation, according to  one forecast.\n    Market forces are increasingly driving renewables growth in the province. Several major projects have secured funding from private investors despite the lack of support by the provincial government. A 400-megawatt  solar project, the largest in the country, received $500 million in backing from a Danish investment group earlier this year, and a North American energy company, TC Energy, agreed to buy more than half of the electricity generated by a 130-megawatt solar project  ...\n The recovery period that follows the current coronavirus-related swoon in the oil industry could be an opportunity to pivot to a new energy future in Alberta, Wood, the labor official, says. In March, the federal government said it was preparing a multibillion-dollar bailout for the struggling oil and gas industry. In response, 256 academics across Canada signed  a letterto Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urging the government to \u201csupport an economic recovery plan that encompasses  ...\n     For now, oil is still king. Less than two miles from Sandmaier\u2019s solar company, refineries continue to process more than 300,000 barrels a day. \u201cWe cannot just continue to prop up [the fossil fuel] industry,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to look at what industries do have hope.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:57:08", "tags": "\u5bfb\u627e,industry,\u827e\u4f2f\u5854\u7701,oil", "title":

"note_en": "William Shakespeare is widely regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time and one of the most important and influential people who has ever lived. His written works (plays, sonnets and poems) have been translated into more than 100 languages and these are performed around the world.\n There is also an enduring desire to learn more about the man himself. Countless books and articles have been written about Shakespeare\u2019s life. These have been based primarily on the scholarly analysis of his works and the official record associated with him and his family. Shakespeare\u2019s popularity and legacy endures, despite  uncertainties in his life story and debate surrounding  his authorship and identity.\n The life and times of William Shakespeare and his family have also recently been informed by cutting-edge archaeological methods and interdisciplinary technologies at both New Place (his long-since demolished family home) and his burial place at Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon. The  evidence gathered from these investigationsby the Centre of Archaeology at Staffordshire University provides new insights into his interests, attitudes and motivations \u2013and those of his family \u2013and shows  ...\n Archaeology has the ability to provide a direct connection to an individual through the places and objects associated with them. Past excavations of the  Shakespearean-era theatres in London have provided evidence of the  places he worked and spent much of his time.\n Attributing objects to Shakespeare is difficult, we have his written work of course,  his portrait(s) and  memorial bust \u2013 but all of his known possessions, like those  mentioned in his will, no longer exist. A single gold signet ring, inscribed with the initials W S, is thought by some to be the most significant object owned and used by the poet, despite its  questionable provenance.\n  Shakespeare\u2019s greatest and most expensive possession was his house, New Place. Evidence, obtained through  recent archaeological investigations of its foundations, give us quantifiable insights into Shakespeare\u2019s thought processes, personal life and business success.\n The building itself was lost in the 18th century, but the site and its remains were preserved beneath a garden. Erected in the centre of Stratford-upon-Avon more than a century prior to Shakespeare\u2019s purchase in 1597, from its inception, it was architecturally striking. One of the largest domestic residences in Stratford, it was the only courtyard-style, open-hall house within the town.\n  This type of house typified the merchant and elite classes and in purchasing and renovating it to his own vision, Shakespeare inherited the traditions of his ancestors while embracing the latest fashions. The building materials used, its primary structure and later redevelopment can all be used as evidence of the  deliberate and carefully considered choices made by him and his family.\n Shakespeare focused on the outward appearance of the house, installing a long gallery and other fashionable architectural embellishments as was expected of a well-to-do, aspiring gentleman of the time. Many other  medieval features were retained and the hall was likely retained as the showpiece of his home, a place to announce his prosperity, and his rise in status.\n It provided a place for him and his immediate and extended family to live, work and entertain. But it was also a place which held local significance and symbolic associations. Intriguingly, its appearance also resembled the courtyard inn theatres of London and elsewhere with which Shakespeare was so familiar, presenting the opportunity to host private performances.\n   Extensive evidence of the personal possessions, diet and the leisure activities of Shakespeare, his family and the inhabitants of New Place were recovered during the archaeological investigations, revolutionising what we understand about his day-to-day life.\n An  online exhibition, due to be made available in early May 2020, presents 3D-scanned artefacts recovered at the site of New Place. These objects, some of which may have belonged to Shakespeare, have been chosen to characterise the chronological development and activities undertaken at the site.\n  Open access to these virtual objects will enable the dissemination of these important results and the potential for others to continue the research.\n  Archaeological evidence recovered from non-invasive investigations at Shakespeare\u2019s burial place has also been used to provide further evidence of his personal and family belief. Multi-frequency Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was  used to investigate the Shakespeare family graves below the chancel of Holy Trinity Church.\n A  number of legendssurrounded Shakespeare \u2019s burial place. Among these were doubts over the presence of a grave, its contents, tales of grave robbing and suggestions of a large family crypt. The work confirmed that individual shallow graves exist beneath the tombstones and that the various members of Shakespeare \u2019s family were not buried in coffins, but in simple shrouds. Analysis concluded that Shakespeare \u2019s grave had been disturbed in the past and that it was likely that his  ...\n  These family graves occupy a significant (and expensive) location in Holy Trinity Church. Despite this, the simple nature of Shakespeare\u2019s grave, with no elite trappings or finery and no large family crypt, coupled with his belief that he should not be disturbed, confirm a simple regional practice based on pious religious observance and an affinity with his hometown.\n    There is still so much we don\u2019t know about Shakespeare\u2019s life, so it\u2019s a safe bet that researchers will continue to investigate what evidence there is. Archaeological techniques can provide quantifiable information that isn\u2019t available through traditional Shakespearean research. But just like other disciplines, interpretation \u2013 based on the evidence \u2013 will be key to unlocking the mysteries surrounding the life (and death) of the English language\u2019s greatest

We have partially released the source code used in this work. You can find the user-level packet I/O engine for Intel 82598/82599 NICs  here. We do not have a definite release plan for other parts of the PacketShader code not made available on the web as of today.\n    PacketShader is a high-performance PC-based software router platform that accelerates the core packet processing with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Based on our observation that the CPU is the typical performance bottleneck in high-speed sofware routers, we scale the computing power in a cost-effective manner with massively-parallel GPU. PacketShader offloads computation and memory-intensive router applications to GPUs while optimizing the packet reception and transmission path on Linux.  ...\n    As you all know, GPU is a central chip in your graphics card. GPUs expose a high level of processing parallelism by supporting tens of thousands of hardware threads and ample memory bandwidth. Beyond fast graphics rendering, recent GPUs are widely used for high-performance parallel applications whose workloads require enormous computation cycles and/or memory bandwidth. The data-parallel execution model of GPU fits nicely with inherent parallelism in most router applications.\n    We implemented high-performance packet I/O engine for user-level application.  This project is being maintained separately, and the source code is publicly available now.  Currently-available Linux network stack is not optimized for high-performance IP packet processing, say, for multi-10G networks. For high-speed software routers and better utilization of GPUs, we optimize the packet I/O path in Linux with the following approach.\n  Huge packet buffer: Instead of allocating metadata (sk_buff or skb) and packet data for each packet reception, PacketShader pre-allocates two circular buffers that can hold a large array of metadata and packet data. This greatly reduces the memory allocation/deallocation overhead for high-speed packet reception.\n  Batch processing: PacketShader batch processes a group of packets at a time in the hardware, device driver, and even in the application layer. This amortize per-packet processing overhead.\n  NUMA-aware data placement: PacketShader minimizes packet movement between local and remote memory in a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) system. Packets received by NICs are processed by its local CPU and memory.\n  Multi-core CPU scalability: PacketShader takes advantage of receive-side scaling (RSS) to eliminate the lock contention in accessing the NIC queues. It also removes the false sharing problem with the CPU cache by aligning the start address of RX queue to the cacheline boundary. Finally, it removes the global  ...\n  With our packet I/O optimization, we are able to run the packet processing in  the user level even for multi-10G router workloads.\n    Figure 1 shows the performance of our optimized packet I/O engine. RX+TX bars represent the case of no-op forwarding, which transmits a packet from a port to another port without further processing.\n    We have implemented four &#34;router applications&#34; based on the packet I/O engine: IPv4 forwarding, IPv6 forwarding, OpenFlow switch, and IPsec tunneling. The below four graphs compare the throughput of the CPU-only implementation and the GPU-accelerated implementation. The performance results clearly show  ...\n    For the IP forwarding, we offloaded longest prefix matching to GPU. Forwarding table lookup is highly memory-intensive, and GPU can acclerate it with both latency hiding capability and bandwidth.\n    OpenFlow and IPsec represent compute-intensive workloads of software routers in our work. We have confirmed that compute-intensive applications can benefit from GPU as well as memory-intensive applications.\n    Our prototype implementation uses two four-core Intel Nehalem CPUs (2.66GHz), four dual-port 10GbE Intel NICs, and two NVIDIA GTX 480 cards. Since we use many PCI-e devices, our machine adopts two IOHs (formerly called Northbridge). Interestingly, the performance of our system is limited by the dual-IOH  ...\n        PacketShader: a GPU-accelerated Software Router ( slides)    Sangjin Han, Keon Jang, KyoungSoo Park and Sue Moon.

"note_en": "Software development teams find life can be much easier if they integrate their work as often as they can. They also find it valuable to release frequently into production. But teams don&#39;t want to expose half-developed features to their users. A useful technique to deal with this tension is to build all the back-end code, integrate, but don&#39;t build the user-interface. The feature can be integrated and tested, but the UI is held back until the end until, like a keystone, it&#39;s added to  ...\n A simple example of this technique might be to give a customer the option of a rush order. Such an order needs to be priced, depending on where the customer lives and what delivery companies operate there. The nature of the goods involved affects the picking approach used in the warehouse. Certain customers may qualify to have rush orders available to them, which may also depend on the delivery location, the time of year, and the kind of goods ordered.\n All in all that&#39;s a fair bit of business logic, particularly since it will involve gnarly integration with various warehousing, catalog, and customer service systems. Doing this could take several weeks, while other features, need to be released every few days. But as far as the user is concerned, a rush order is just a check-box on the order form.\n To build this using the check-box as the keystone, the team does development work on the underlying business logic and interfaces to internal systems over the course of several production releases. The user is unaware of all this latent code. Only with the last step does the keystone check-box need to be made visible, which can be done in a relatively short time. This way all latent code can be integrated and be part of the system going into production, reducing the problems that come with a long-lived  ...\n  The latent code does need to be tested to the same degree of confidence that it would be if it were active. This can be done providing the architecture of the system is setup so that most testing isn&#39;t done through the user interface.  Unit Tests and other lower layers of the  Test Pyramid should be easy to run this way. Even  Broad Stack Tests can be run providing there is a mechanism to make them  Subcutaneous Tests. In some cases there will a significant amount of behavior within the UI itself,  ...\n Not all applications are built in such a way that they can be extensively tested in a subcutaneous manner - but the effort required to do this is worthwhile even without the capability to use a keystone. Tests running through the UI are always more trouble to setup, even with the best tools to automate the process. Moving more tests to subcutaneous and lower level tests, especially unit tests, can dramatically speed up  Deployment Pipelines and enable  Continuous Delivery.\n Of course, most UIs will be more than a check-box, although often they aren&#39;t that much more work to keystone. In a web app, a complex feature will often be an independent web page, that can be built and tested in full, and the keystone is merely a link. A desktop may have several screens where the keystone is the menu-item to make them visible.\n That said, there are cases when the UI can&#39;t be packaged into a simple keystone. When that&#39;s the case then it&#39;s time to use  Feature Toggles. Even in this case, however, thinking of a keystone can be useful by ensuring that the feature toggle only applies to the UI. This avoids scattering lots of toggle points through the back end code, reduces the complexity of applying the toggle, allows the use of  simple toggle mechanisms, and makes it easier to remove when the time comes.\n There is a general danger with developing a UI last, in that the back-end code may be designed in a way that doesn&#39;t work with the UI once it&#39;s built, or the UI isn&#39;t given the attention it needs until late, leading to a lack of iteration and a poor user experience. For those reasons a keystone approach works best within an overall approach that encourages building a product through thin vertical slices that lead to releasing small but fully working features rapidly.\n I&#39;ve used the example of a user-interface here, but of course the same approach can be used with any other interface, such as an API. By building the consumer&#39;s interface last, and keeping it simple, we can build and integrate even large features in small chunks.\n Dark Launching is a variation where the new feature is called once its built, but no results are shown to the user. This is done to measure the impact on the back-end systems, which is useful for some changes. Once all is good, we can add the keystone.\n I first came across the metaphor of a keystone for this technique in the second edition of Kent Beck&#39;s  Extreme Programming Explained .

"note_en": "One of the questions I get asked the most these days is when the world will be able to go back to the way things were in December before the coronavirus pandemic. My answer is always the same: when we have an almost perfect drug to treat COVID-19, or when almost every person on the planet has been vaccinated against coronavirus.\n The former is unlikely to happen anytime soon. We\u2019d need a miracle treatment that was at least 95 percent effective to stop the outbreak. Most of the  drug candidates right now are nowhere near that powerful. They could save a lot of lives, but they aren\u2019t enough to get us back to normal.\n  Humankind has never had a more urgent task than creating broad immunity for coronavirus. Realistically, if we\u2019re going to return to normal, we need to develop a safe, effective vaccine. We need to make billions of doses, we need to get them out to every part of the world, and we need all of this to happen as quickly as possible.\n That sounds daunting, because it is. Our foundation is the biggest funder of vaccines in the world, and this effort dwarfs anything we\u2019ve ever worked on before. It\u2019s going to require a global cooperative effort like the world has never seen. But I know it\u2019ll get done. There\u2019s simply no alternative.\n Here\u2019s what you need to know about the race to create a COVID-19 vaccine.\n  Dr. Anthony Fauci has said he thinks it\u2019ll take around eighteen months to develop a coronavirus vaccine. I agree with him, though it could be as little as 9 months or as long as two years.\n Although eighteen months might sound like a long time, this would be the fastest scientists have created a new vaccine. Development usually takes around five years. Once you pick a disease to target, you have to create the vaccine and test it on animals. Then you begin testing for safety and efficacy in humans.\n Safety and efficacy are the two most important goals for every vaccine.  Safety is exactly what it sounds like: is the vaccine safe to give to people? Some minor side effects (like a mild fever or injection site pain) can be acceptable, but you don\u2019t want to inoculate people with something that makes them sick.\n Efficacy measures how well the vaccine protects you from getting sick. Although you\u2019d ideally want a vaccine to have 100 percent efficacy, many don\u2019t. For example, this year\u2019s flu vaccine is  around 45 percent effective.\n  Phase one is the safety trial. A small group of healthy volunteers gets the vaccine candidate. You try out different dosages to create the strongest immune response at the lowest effective dose without serious side effects.\n  Once you\u2019ve settled on a formula, you move onto  phase two, which tells you how well the vaccine works in the people who are intended to get it. This time, hundreds of people get the vaccine. This cohort should include people of different ages and health statuses.\n  Then, in  phase three, you give it to thousands of people. This is usually the longest phase, because it occurs in what\u2019s called \u201cnatural disease conditions.\u201d You introduce it to a large group of people who are likely already at the risk of infection by the target pathogen, and then wait and see if the vaccine reduces how many people get sick.\n After the vaccine passes all three trial phases, you start building the factories to manufacture it, and it gets submitted to the WHO and various government agencies for approval.\n This process works well for most vaccines, but the normal development timeline isn\u2019t good enough right now. Every day we can cut from this process will make a huge difference to the world in terms of saving lives and reducing trillions of dollars in economic damage.\n So, to speed up the process, vaccine developers are compressing the timeline. This graphic shows how:\n       In the traditional process, the steps are sequential to address key questions and unknowns. This can help mitigate financial risk, since creating a new vaccine is expensive. Many candidates fail, which is why companies wait to invest in the next step until they know the previous step was successful.\n For COVID-19, financing development is not an issue. Governments and other organizations (including our foundation and an amazing alliance called the  Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) have made it clear they will support whatever it takes to find a vaccine. So, scientists are able to save time by doing several of the development steps at once. For example, the private sector, governments, and our foundation are going to start identifying facilities to manufacture  ...\n Fortunately, compressing the trial timeline isn\u2019t the only way to take a process that usually takes five years and get it done in 18 months. Another way we\u2019re going to do that is by testing lots of different approaches at the same time.\n  As of April 9, there are  115 different COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the development pipeline. I think that eight to ten of those look particularly promising. (Our foundation is going to keep an eye on all the others to see if we missed any that have some positive characteristics, though.)\n     The most promising candidates take a variety of approaches to protecting the body against COVID-19. To understand what exactly that means, it\u2019s helpful to remember how the human immune system works.\n When a disease pathogen gets into your system, your immune system responds by producing antibodies. These antibodies attach themselves to substances called  antigens on the surface of the microbe, which sends a signal to your body to attack. Your immune system keeps a record of every microbe it has ever defeated, so that it can quickly recognize and destroy invaders before they make you ill.\n Vaccines circumvent this whole process by teaching your body how to defeat a pathogen without ever getting sick. The two most common types\u2014and the ones you\u2019re probably most familiar with\u2014are inactivated and live  vaccines. Inactivated vaccines contain pathogens that have been killed. Live vaccines, on the other hand, are made of living pathogens that have been weakened (or \u201cattenuated \u201d). They \u2019re highly effective but more prone to side effects than their inactivated  ...\n Inactivated and live vaccines are what we consider \u201ctraditional\u201d approaches. There are a number of COVID-19 vaccine candidates of both types, and for good reason: they\u2019re well-established. We know how to test and manufacture them.\n The downside is that they\u2019re time-consuming to make. There\u2019s a ton of material in each dose of a vaccine. Most of that material is biological, which means you have to grow it. That takes time, unfortunately.\n That\u2019s why I\u2019m particularly excited by two new approaches that some of the candidates are taking:  RNA and DNA vaccines. If one of these new approaches pans out, we\u2019ll likely be able to get vaccines out to the whole world much faster. (For the sake of simplicity, I\u2019m only going to explain RNA vaccines. DNA vaccines are similar, just with a different type of genetic material and method of administration.)\n Our foundation\u2014both through our own funding and through  CEPI\u2014has been supporting the development of an RNA vaccine platform for nearly a decade. We were planning to use it to make vaccines for diseases that affect the poor like malaria, but now it\u2019s looking like one of the most promising options for COVID. The first candidate to start human trials was an RNA vaccine created by a company called Moderna.\n Here\u2019s how an RNA vaccine works: rather than injecting a pathogen\u2019s antigen into your body, you instead give the body the genetic code needed to produce that antigen itself. When the antigens appear on the outside of your cells, your immune system attacks them\u2014and learns how to defeat future intruders in the process. You essentially turn your body into its own vaccine manufacturing unit.\n Because RNA vaccines let your body do most of the work, they don \u2019t require much material. That makes them much faster to manufacture. There \u2019s a catch, though: we don \u2019t know for sure yet if RNA is a viable platform for vaccines. Since COVID would be the first RNA vaccine out of the gate, we have to prove both that the platform itself works and that it creates immunity. It \u2019s a bit like building your computer system and your first piece of software at the same  ...\n Even if an RNA vaccine continues to show promise, we still must continue pursuing the other options. We don\u2019t know yet what the COVID-19 vaccine will look like. Until we do, we have to go full steam ahead on as many approaches as possible.\n  The smallpox vaccine is the only vaccine that\u2019s wiped an entire disease off the face of the earth, but it\u2019s also pretty brutal to receive. It left a scar on the arm of anyone who got it. One out of every three people had side effects bad enough to keep them home from school or work. A small\u2014but not insignificant\u2014number developed more serious reactions.\n The smallpox vaccine was far from perfect, but it got the job done. The COVID-19 vaccine might be similar.\n If we were designing the perfect vaccine, we\u2019d want it to be completely safe and 100 percent effective. It should be a single dose that gives you lifelong protection, and it should be easy to store and transport. I hope the COVID-19 vaccine has all of those qualities, but given the timeline we\u2019re on, it may not.\n The two priorities, as I mentioned earlier, are  safety and  efficacy. Since we might not have time to do multi-year studies, we will have to conduct robust phase 1 safety trials and make sure we have good real-world evidence that the vaccine is completely safe to use.\n We have a bit more wiggle room with efficacy. I suspect a vaccine that is at least 70 percent effective will be enough to stop the outbreak. A 60 percent effective vaccine is useable, but we might still see some localized outbreaks. Anything under 60 percent is unlikely to create enough herd immunity to stop the virus.\n The big challenge will be making sure the vaccine works well in older people. The older you are, the less effective vaccines are. Your immune system\u2014like the rest of your body\u2014ages and is slower to recognize and attack invaders. That\u2019s a big issue for a COVID-19 vaccine, since older people are the most vulnerable. We need to make sure they\u2019re protected.\n The shingles vaccine\u2014which is also targeted to older people\u2014combats this by amping up the strength of the vaccine. It\u2019s possible we do something similar for COVID, although it might come with more side effects. Health authorities could also ask people over a certain age to get an additional dose.\n  How many doses will it be? A vaccine you only get once is easier and quicker to deliver. But we may need a multi-dose vaccine to get enough efficacy.\n  How long does it last? Ideally, the vaccine will give you long-lasting protection. But we might end up with one that only stops you from getting sick for a couple months (like the seasonal flu vaccine, which protects you for about six months). If that happens, the short-term vaccine might be used while we work on a more durable one.\n  How do you store it? Many common vaccines are kept at 4 degrees C. That\u2019s around the temperature of your average refrigerator, so storage and transportation is easy. But RNA vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperature\u2014as low as -80 degrees C\u2014which will make reaching certain parts of the world more difficult.\n My hope is that the vaccine we have 18 months from now is as close to \u201cperfect\u201d as possible. Even if it isn\u2019t, we will continue working to improve it. After that happens, I suspect the COVID-19 vaccine will become part of the routine newborn immunization schedule.\n Once we have a vaccine, though, we still have huge problems to solve. That\u2019s because\u2026\n  In order to stop the pandemic, we need to make the vaccine available to almost every person on the planet. We\u2019ve never delivered something to every corner of the world before. And, as I mentioned earlier, vaccines are particularly difficult to make and store.\n There\u2019s a lot we can\u2019t figure out about manufacturing and distributing the vaccine until we know what exactly we\u2019re working with. For example, will we be able to use existing vaccine factories to make the COVID-19 vaccine?\n What we can do now is build different kinds of vaccine factories to prepare. Each vaccine type requires a different kind of factory. We need to be ready with facilities that can make each type, so that we can start manufacturing the final vaccine (or vaccines) as soon as we can. This will cost billions of dollars. Governments need to quickly find a mechanism for making the funding for this available. Our foundation is currently working with CEPI,  ...\n Part of those discussions center on who will get the vaccine when. The reality is that not everyone will be able to get the vaccine at the same time. It\u2019ll take months\u2014or even years\u2014to create 7 billion doses (or possibly 14 billion, if it\u2019s a multi-dose vaccine), and we should start distributing them as soon as the first batch is ready to go.\n Most people agree that health workers should get the vaccine first. But who gets it next? Older people? Teachers? Workers in essential jobs?\n I think that low-income countries should be some of the first to receive it, because people will be at a much higher risk of dying in those places. COVID-19 will spread much quicker in poor countries because measures like physical distancing are harder to enact. More people have poor underlying health that makes them more vulnerable to complications, and weak health systems will make it harder for them to receive the care they need. Getting the  ...\n With most vaccines, manufacturers sign a deal with the country where their factories are located, so that country gets first crack at the vaccines. It\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s what will happen here. I hope we find a way to get it out on an equitable basis to the whole world. The WHO and national health authorities will need to develop a distribution plan once we have a better understanding of what we\u2019re working with.\n Eventually, though, we\u2019re going to scale this thing up so that the vaccine is available to everyone. And then, we\u2019ll be able to get back to normal\u2014and to hopefully make decisions that prevent us from being in this situation ever again.\n It might be a bit hard to see right now, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We\u2019re doing the right things to get a vaccine as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I urge you to continue following the guidelines set by your local authorities. Our ability to get through this outbreak will depend on everyone doing their part to keep each other safe.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:56:34", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u75ab\u82d7,covid,vaccine", "title": "\u5173\u4e8e\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75ab\u82d7\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u662f", "title_en": "What you need to know about the Covid-19 vaccine", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/What-you-need-to-know-about-the-COVID-19-vaccine?WT.mc_id=20200430100000_COVID-19-vaccine_BG-EM_&WT.tsrc=BGEM", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u75ab\u82d7", "covid", "vaccine"]}]
