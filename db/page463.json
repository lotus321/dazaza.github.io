"note_en": "The breathtaking slowdown in global aviation is taking a huge toll on Boeing, which said on Wednesday that it would slash about 16,000 jobs after reporting that revenue tumbled by 26 percent in the first three months of the year.\n \u201cThe global pandemic has changed the way we live and work,\u201d said Boeing\u2019s chief executive, David L. Calhoun, in a note to staff. \u201cIt is changing our industry. We are facing utterly unexpected challenges.\u201d\n Airlines around the world are trying to stay alive, with losses expected to total more than $300 billion by year\u2019s end, according to an industry trade group. As a result, many carriers are delaying purchases, deliveries and maintenance.\n Boeing said it was slowing aircraft production, including for the troubled 737 Max, the 787, the 777 and the 777x. The company is also exploring ways to raise more capital, either from the federal government or from financial markets. The job cuts, about 10 percent of Boeing\u2019s staff, will be even steeper for those employed in the divisions most exposed to the downturn, the commercial airplanes and services businesses. Staff cuts in those units will be about 15 percent.\n \u201cI know this news is a blow during an already challenging time,\u201d Mr. Calhoun said in the note. \u201cI regret the impact this will have on many of you. I sincerely wish there were some other way.\u201d\n  Boeing reported a net loss of $641 million in the first quarter, compared with a $2.1 billion profit a year earlier.\n The company has said that it does not expect air travel to recover to levels reached before the pandemic for three years and that it would most likely take several years more for travel to return to its previous long-term growth rate.\n Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft business was especially hard hit in the first quarter by the grounding of the Max and the pandemic, with revenues for that business down nearly 50 percent, to $6.2 billion, from a year earlier. Total revenue dropped to $16.9 billion. The company received just 49 new orders and had 196 cancellations between January and March.\n On Tuesday, Southwest Airlines said it had been negotiating a reduction in the number of 737 Max jets that it would accept this year. Southwest said it would now receive no more than 48 Max jets by the end of 2021, instead of the 107 it had previously expected to take.\n Boeing said it hoped to reach its job cut targets through voluntary means, including buyouts and early-retirement offers. Employees who take the buyout will receive three months of health care and one week of pay for every year they have worked at Boeing, up to 26 years, the company told workers last week. Employees have until Monday to signal their interest in buyouts. If approved, they would leave in early June.\n Any cuts are likely to be disproportionately focused on Boeing\u2019s facilities in Washington State and South Carolina, home to its three major commercial aircraft factories. A  weekslong shutdown of operations at those facilities disrupted production of passenger planes but also affected Boeing\u2019s defense and space business.\n While Boeing is struggling to manage the effect of the pandemic, the company this week also expressed concern for the health of its suppliers, which receive about 70 percent of the company\u2019s revenues.\n \u201cCurrently, our team is focused on the best ways to keep liquidity flowing through our industry and to our supply chain until our customers are buying airplanes and related services again,\u201d Mr. Calhoun told shareholders on Monday.\n To that end, the company has taken out a loan, cut costs and suspended dividend payments and stock buybacks, he said. Boeing has $15.5 billion in cash on hand, but plans to raise more capital soon. In an interview on CNBC on Wednesday, Mr. Calhoun did not specify whether some of that would be in the form of  federal aid.\n On Wednesday, Boeing also said it had suffered more than $2 billion in one-off costs in the first quarter.\n A slower-than-expected ramp-up in production of the 737 Max, which was grounded last year after two fatal crashes, subtracted about $1 billion from the company\u2019s bottom line. And it incurred a pretax charge of $827 million for the KC-46A Tanker, most of it stemming from repairs Boeing agreed to make this month  after discussions with the Air Force.\n The company took a $336 million charge for repairs on the 737 Next Generation aircraft, and the four-week suspension of work at Boeing\u2019s facilities in Washington State cost the company about $137 million.\n Over the weekend, Boeing also announced that it was  terminating its $4.2 billion deal to buy an 80 percent stake of Embraer\u2019s commercial jet business. Embraer is contesting that move and said Monday that it had begun arbitration proceedings.\n   If you\u2019ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n  This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on  how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \u201cHow will we know when to reopen the country?\u201d In  an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson  staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs  ...\n  The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts  donations here.  Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the  American Red Cross, and  World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related  GoFundMe fund-raisershave started  ...\n  The C.D.C. has  recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting  new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don \u2019t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they  ...\n  If you\u2019re sick and you think you\u2019ve been exposed to the new coronavirus,  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there\u2019s a chance \u2014 because of a lack of testing kits or because you\u2019re asymptomatic, for instance \u2014 you won\u2019t be able to get tested.\n  It seems to spread  very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n  No.  Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n  Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and  little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions \u2014 not just those with respiratory diseases \u2014 particularly hard.\n  If the family member doesn\u2019t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible,  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C.If there \u2019s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not  ...\n  Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves,  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n  Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don\u2019t live in your home.  Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n  That\u2019s not a good idea. Even if you\u2019re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year\u2019s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n  Watching your balance go up and down can be scary.  You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions \u2014 don\u2019t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you\u2019re at least saving as much as you can to get that \u201cfree money.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:51:22", "tags":

"note_en": "For a while now I have been contemplating a series of seminars titled  &#34;Everyproof assistant&#34; that would be devoted to all the different proof assistantsout there. Apart from the established ones( Isabelle/HOL,  Coq, Agda, Lean), there are other interesting experimentalproof assistants, and some that are still under development, or just proofs ofconcept. I would like to know more about them, and I suspect I am not the onlyone.\n Getting the authors of proof assistants to travel to Ljubljana and giving talksat our  Foundations of mathematics and theoretical computerscienceseminar has largely become impossible. But luckily research seminars world-wideare rapidly moving online, and so is our Foundations seminar. I am thereforedelighted to announce the first &#34;Every proof assistant&#34; seminar:\n Time: Thursday, April 30, 2020 from 18:00 to 19:00 (Central European Summer Time, UTC+2)  Location: online at  Zoom ID 965 4439 5816  Speaker:  Valery Isaev (JetBrains research)\n  Abstract:I will discuss Arend, a proof assistant developed at JetBrainsResearch. The aim of Arend is to provide a powerful system for formalizationresults in homotopy type theory and in ordinary mathematics. To achieve thelatter goal, we prove a flexible class system with subtyping, universepolymorphism with a powerful level inference mechanism, quotient sets with aconvenient pattern matching principles for them. We also recently implementeda tactic framework which can be used to automate  ...\n I have a couple more in the pipeline, so follow this blog, the  Foundations seminar announcements or my Twitter account  @andrejbauer.\n     Will PVS and ACL2 be covered. Both are in the Boyer-Moore family. ACL2 has a significant user based in hardware verification. PVS is used in the CPS community.\n  I am not sure what we will cover. We will start with proof assistants that are closer to the type-theoretic community, just because I know the scenery there better.\n PVS and ACL2 definitely belong to the &#34;established&#34; group, together with Coq, Agda, Lean, Isabelle etc. We will get to those eventually.\n      Will these talked be recorded and put out somewhere? They look extremely interesting and it would be a same to miss them.\n      My proof editor (DC Proof) is a very simple system based on my own versions of natural deduction and set theory which you may find interesting in themselves. DC Proof was designed to introduce math undergrads to the basic methods of proof.\n I am an amateur software developer. I am not associated with any academic institution and have no postgraduate degrees.\n  I messed up the time zones and missed the first talk.Any chance a recording will be available?Looking forward to the series!\n  The seminars will be recorded and the videos will be published online. See the link above for the first video. I will also provide links to the proof assistants.\n If you would like to suggest a proof assistant, please contact me by e-mail. I took note of the suggestions in the comments.\n Write your comment using  Markdown.

"note_en": "AI startup companies have been emerging at breakneck speed for the past few years, all the while touting TOPS benchmark data. But what does it really mean and does a TOPS number apply across every application? Answer: It depends on a variety of factors.\n Historically, every class of design has used some kind of standard benchmark for both product development and positioning. For example, SPECint, dhrystone, and geekbench are used as a set of benchmark programs for processor performance. RFC 2544 is used to benchmark networking ASICs. But the development of more customized and heterogeneous hardware, coupled with continuous updates in AI algorithms, has made decisions based on benchmarks murky at best.\n \u201cIn recent years, we have seen a lot of advancements in hardware choices available for AI \u2013 from GPUs to FPGAs to custom hardware ASICs,\u201d said Anoop Saha, market development manager at Mentor, a Siemens Business. \u201cHowever, the existing benchmarks are not suitable for measuring how the hardware will work for AI applications \u2013 either in training or in inference.\u201d\n Currently, TOPS (tera operations per second) is the most common metric used for describing the performance of many hardware design. But buyer beware.\n \u201cThere are a zillion companies out there doing inference, and they make a lot of claims, \u201dsaid Steve Teig, CEO of Perceive. \u201cMany of those claims are overblown. When people say, \u2018I have this many TOPS and this many TOPS per watt, \u2019I encourage them to poke at that. I do that when I look at other people \u2019s claims. I think, \u2018You claim you run this network at this speed, and you can look up on the web how many ops is this network at that speed. You could figure it out then determine how many TOPS  ...\n Understanding what makes up a TOPS number requires understanding of what exactly is being tested. But that does little for providing the context for how a device will behave in the real world.\n \u201cTOPS measures only the performance of a chip, \u201dsaid Saha. \u201cPower consumption is a bigger challenge in acceleration of neural networks. That is because of the highly parallel nature of these algorithms, which also have significant memory accesses. A better metric is TOPS per watt \u2014performance per unit of energy. Indeed, most datasheets of AI hardware now describe both TOPS and TOPS per watt as a metric, and both are important. TOPS per watt is even more important for edge devices compared to  ...\n A TOPS number also can vary depending on whether it is measuring fixed or floating point operations, according to Pulin Desai, group director for product marketing, management and business development at Cadence. \u201cFor fixed-point operations, usually people will use tera ops numbers. Sometimes they may throw in some floating point operations and refer to giga ops, which is floating point operations per second. A third thing engineering groups say is, \u2018I don \u2019t care about raw capacity. You have  ...\n Looking deeper To understand a TOPS number requires some investigative work. For example, what type of operations are included in that number? If a product is running at 1GHz with 2,048 8-bit operations, that equals 2,048 times 1,024 giga ops, or 2 TOPS. But if it\u2019s really 4-bit operations, the number of 4-bit operations might be able to be doubled and it may be advertised as 20 TOPS.\n \u201cGenerally, we tend to stick to 8-bit because most of the inference happening today is on 8-bit, \u201dDesai said. \u201cAnd that \u2019s a multiply accumulate operation. But now insert a DSP, where there are a lot of parallels operations. If there is another operation in parallel, because it \u2019s a parallel device, you have to add up the 2,048 multiplier accumulator operations plus this other 8-bit operation. More simply, I say the number of MAC operations and number of 8-bit operations. You add those up  ...\n This kind of detail is essential to determine exactly what is being measured. \u201cIf somebody was giving you the tera ops numbers, then what type of data types is it \u20142-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit? What did you use? If you calculated tera ops, what frequency did you assume? And is your device only doing this operation, or are there some other operations happening in parallel? If they gave the information on a particular network, then the same question applies. \u2018Did you use fixed point to give  ...\n This is far from an objective analysis, however. Performance can vary depending on the optimizations done on the network, such as pruning, quantization and compression. Many machine learning models can provide similar accuracy with a low precision integer model instead of using floating point operations. So a TOPS per watt for a hardware using a 32-bit-integer precision would be different from that with 8-bit-integer precision. Depending on the accuracy they require, the user can decide  ...\n The bigger question is which applications should be run to provide accurate benchmark metrics. \u201cFor a while now, common networks like MobileNet, ImageNet and ResNet are used for those metrics, \u201dSaha said. \u201cWhat is needed is a standardized set of benchmark applications, which are not only fair and exhaustive, but which have a common dataset to avoid any variations that can happen from the datasets. MLPerf is an industry initiative aimed at developing a standardized benchmark applications  ...\n Benchmarking in context In all of this it is helpful to remember this is a relatively immature market developing literally by the day, noted Andrew Grant, senior director for artificial intelligence at Imagination Technologies. \u201cThings are changing all the time, so for any sort of chip architect or SoC architect they \u2019ve got a lot of stuff to take in and try to understand. If you look at mature markets like CPUs where CoreMark and things like that are quite important \u2014or if you look at  ...\n With AI, there are different benchmarks to look at different aspects of performance. \u201cBut even then, you end up with a situation where if you \u2019re looking at say, a mobile GPU, then how that particular GPU performs over a period of time and what its drain on the battery is could be really important. But that isn \u2019t taken into account by the pixel drawing aspects of that benchmark, \u201dGrant explained. \u201cWhen we look at the AI benchmarks themselves, remember that the whole artificial intelligence,  ...\n To make matters more confusing, different benchmarks apply at different levels in the development of an SoC. In Imagination \u2019s case, because its IP will then go into someone else \u2019s SoC, a lot of the benchmark activity is related directly to a particular network under a particular set of circumstances. \u201cWe are often asked whether we can run a representative network of what the customer is likely to actually use, and then we will work through and run that on a GPU or run that on our  ...\n Beyond MLPerf, a number of organizations are seeking to establish a more comprehensive basket as a benchmark. This is similar to what happened in the CPU and GPU space. For instance, AI-Benchmark.com does a lot of work on networks that already have made their way into silicon.\n What is needed today is a common understanding of what the different areas of AI benchmarks mean, and what the implications are for unbalanced benchmarks. \u201cThere are examples in GPU-land where manufacturers end up having to chase a particular benchmark, because that \u2019s one of the common benchmarks that is quoted, although it may no longer be relevant for the users. You end up in that rather strange situation where the numbers that have been displayed on the billboard are great, but  ...\n  Benchmark accuracy Beyond all of this is the accuracy of the AI benchmark results. \u201cThis is a key point that was introduced in the latest version of AI-Benchmark, \u201dsaid Salvatore De Dominicis, application engineering manager for AI at Imagination. \u201cWhen you \u2019re analyzing a quantized network, there is a very high risk of losing precision and getting a result that is not actually accurate unless the IP is designed in a way to preserve precision and accuracy when it \u2019s needed. This  ...\n Accomplishing all of this, while also maintaining performance and low power consumption, is non-trivial. \u201cThis is why the benchmark vendors like AI-Benchmark actually pushed the introduction of this new category, \u201dDe Dominicis said. \u201cBasically, the score is heavily influenced by the quality of the results, which is in the optic of the whole market being quite new. So the situation is not stable. Things are moving. Initially there were a lot of solutions that had at first looked  ...\n To make IP more accurate requires designing the hardware so that the internal precision is kept high when necessary, De Dominicis noted. \u201cThe problem then becomes understanding when it \u2019s necessary, because you obviously don \u2019t want to pay the cost everywhere. Otherwise, you will have increasing area and power consumption. The idea is that you want to have a good final accuracy. This means that the output of the network is as close as possible to the theoretical output. We provide  ...\n Implications of architectural choices Once the applications and the metrics are well-defined, designers face a critical choice. \u201cWhat are the levers they can play with to get optimal performance and power metrics? Choosing the right architecture is extremely vital here, because they have the biggest ROI for improving results, \u201dSaha said. \u201cHere, too, one size does not fit all. A designer will need to align the goals and use cases to select the right architecture. Whether it is  ...\n Finding the optimial architecture requires running the benchmark applications as early as possible, getting accurate performance and power numbers, and having the ability to tweak the architecture quickly. And then, repeat everything. In other words, system architects need to take a build-measure-learn approach to create a use case-based optimized architecture for the AI hardware.\n \u201cThere is a special class of application specific hardware accelerators, typically used in edge or IoT devices, \u201dSaha said. \u201cThe use cases would be limited to a few specific neural network algorithms. Making the right architecture choices become even more vital for these accelerators, which must be tuned for the application. For example, in a deep neural network, different layers might need different architectures. Some layers might have a millions of weights, which need to  ...\n Looking ahead Within this rapidly evolving area, the challenges are constantly evolving. A network may not be the right one, or there might be a newer one coming.\n \u201cThe newer one may require more processing capacity, or they may require some different kind of things, \u201dsaid Cadence \u2019s Desai. \u201cDevelopment teams end up looking at two levels. First, they make sure they have a scalable solution because they need flexibility or future proofing. This is about having the ability to respond to the changes in the marketplace by having a flexible architecture. It could be flexible in terms of programmability or how they make it. It could be scalable.  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:50:57", "tags": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd,\u57fa\u51c6,world,\u64cd\u4f5c,benchmark", "title": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u9ed1\u6697\u4e16\u754c", "title_en": "The Murky World of AI Benchmarks", "transed": 0, "url": "https://semiengineering.com/the-murky-world-of-ai-benchmarks/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd", "\u57fa\u51c6", "world", "\u64cd\u4f5c", "benchmark"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000105, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4f60\u62c5\u5fc3\u6cc4\u9732\u4f60\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5730\u5740\u5417\uff1f\u538c\u5026\u4e86\u6536\u5230\u4f60\u4ece\u672a\u6ce8\u518c\u8fc7\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5417\uff1f\u90a3\u4e9b\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u771f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5417\uff1f\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u522b\u540d\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u60a8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u8fdc\u79bb\u5783\u573e\u90ae\u4ef6\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u8fdc\u79bb\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u7c97\u7565\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u5f53\u8868\u5355\u9700\u8981\u60a8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5730\u5740\u65f6\uff0c\u8bf7\u5355\u51fb\u201c\u4e2d\u7ee7\u201d\u6309\u94ae\u63d0\u4f9b\u522b\u540d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4f1a\u5c06\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u4ece\u522b\u540d\u8f6c\u53d1\u5230\u60a8\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6536\u4ef6\u7bb1\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u4efb\u4f55\u522b\u540d\u5f00\u59cb\u63a5\u6536\u60a8\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5176\u7981\u7528\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u5220\u9664\u3002", "note_en": "Do you worry about giving away your email address?

"note_en": "With interchangeable lenses and a 12-MP sensor, the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera provides a lot more flexibility and resolution than other modules.\n   The Raspberry Pi Camera Module is one of those add ons that we love to play with. Creating images and videos using a $35   Raspberry Pi in real time is still mind blowing for most. You can even use your   Raspberry Pi as a \u00a0PC webcam. But the two previous first-party camera modules have suffered with a fixed focus, albeit good quality, lens and fragile construction.\n  Enter the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera, a new module that ups the image quality with a new 12-MP sensor and supports interchangeable lenses and tripod-mounting. The module is larger and, at $50 without any of the required lenses, quite a bit more expensive than prior models, but the increased resolution and flexibility make it a great choice for photography-intensive projects.\n    A 12.3 megapixel Sony IMX477R sensor on the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera offers significantly more pixels than the 8-MP Pi Camera V2, the previous first-party module which will remain on sale. The camera is also much larger than previous models, measuring 38mm square, versus 24mm by 23mm for the V2.\n The reason for the size increase is due to an interchangeable C mount where compatible lenses (sold seperately) can be screwed into place. The included adapter will also enable CS lenses to be used with the camera.\n  At the four corners of the camera are M2.5 screw holes, which can be used to mechanically connect the camera to an object / frame. At the base of the camera is a 0.25-inch screw point for connecting the camera to a standard photography tripod.\n The final hardware feature is the inclusion of a 200mm ribbon cable compatible with the CSI (camera) connector on all models of Pi, with the exception of the Pi Zero range which requires an adapter for the later boards. Take care when inserting the cable into your powered down Raspberry Pi as the connection is fragile.\n When using the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera, you will need to have a reliable power source. In our tests with a Raspberry Pi 4 we found that the screen would blank when taking an image due to the amount of power being used. The solution is to use the official Raspberry Pi USB charger or another which provides at least 3 amps and 5 volts of reliable juice.\n  The camera is nothing without a lens, and in our supplied review unit we tested a 6mm CCTV C mount lens and a 16mm CS mount lens. The lenses retail for $15 and $50 respectively and you\u2019ll need to buy one right away because the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera module doesn\u2019t include one in the box.\n  To use any of the official cameras with a Raspberry Pi we first need to enable the camera interface in the Raspberry Pi Configuration tool (sudo raspi-config)l. Then, after a reboot, we can start taking pictures.\n You may be thinking that we could use the Raspberry PI High Quality Camera with applications such as Cheese or guvcview, but sadly this is not easily done, and in our tests the images created with Cheese had a nasty purple tint, and guvcview would refuse to start with the camera connected. Hopefully, future software updates will resolve these issues.\n   However, on the bright side, the Chromium browser did recognize the Raspberry Pi High Quality Cameras as a webcam and we were able to use it successfully in Google Meet. Presumably, any other web-based camera application would work just as well.\n   The first time we take a picture with any official camera, we use raspistill, Raspbian\u2019s built-in capture command, which can quickly show if the camera is connected and working as expected. To test the focus of the camera we ran raspistill with the -k switch, which enabled us to set the focus of the lens.\n The Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera\u2019s maximum resolution is 4056 x 3040 pixels (5K) and this produces an image of around 6MB in size. Images are typically saved as JPG, but we can also select RAW, GIF, BMP, PNG, YUV420, RG8888 file formats.\n Another way to capture images and video is via the Picamera Python module which enables the camera to be used in projects powered by the popular programming language. With Picamera we can trigger the camera to take an image / video using sensors and inputs connected to the GPIO. At the time of writing the Picamera library has basic functionality and can record 1080p video and 5K images, and also manipulate the images on the fly. Enhanced functionality for the Raspberry Pi High Quality  ...\n  The previous camera modules provided a decent entry into photography with Raspberry Pi, but they images that were at best \u201cgood \u201d. With a fixed focus lens, the subject had to be brought to the lens and composition was cramped. Version 2 of the Raspberry Pi Camera Module did feature a focus ring to alter the focus of the camera. But this required a special tool to rotate, otherwise you&#39;d risk scratching the lens. Color reproduction was poor and image quality was grainy. But for  ...\n With the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera, we see much sharper images with rich colors. A manually controlled focus means that we can compose our shots and focus in on specific areas and blur out the rest of the shot for that professional look.\n  We took the same shots using the older V2 camera and the new High Quality Camera and as you can see the images are vastly superior with the new camera.\n Overall the image quality with the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera is much better. Indoors and out, we were able to take clear images and change the light levels manually and focus our shots according to the subject. Sadly the weather was not with us at the time of review; rain and electronics rarely mix so further testing will be conducted and added to the review.\n   To record video on the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera, \u00a0we can use the Python Picamera library or we can use  &lt;CODE&gt;raspivid&lt;/CODE&gt; in the terminal. The video output from the latter is in H264 format, which can be played using the VLC or omxplayer media players. At the time of writing the playback is not perfect, and can jump around erratically from time to time. But playing the same video on our Lenovo laptop provided a smooth experience.\n So can the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera capture 4K video? Sorry, no. The best is still 1080p at 30 fps. We did push the camera a little further and managed to get 1080p at 60fps, but it was a little glitchy. To capture higher fps videos we need to drop the resolution. We captured decent footage at 800x600 120fps but it was a little glitchy. We found that converting the video to m4v via the excellent Handbrake video conversion tool provided much better playback.\n   Yes it will, if you have a Pi Zero with the small CSI connector then you can connect up the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera Module and use it in a project. We tested 1080p video recording and still images at max resolution on a Pi Zero. All worked well, if a little slowly compared to a Pi 4. So if you are planning to use the Pi Zero with this camera, don\u2019t expect high speed reactions for trail cameras or home security. But you will get great results.\n The Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera is designed to work with the majority of Pi. The only exception being the first generation of Pi Zero which have no CSI port. But which model is best? Well for larger still images we need to use more GPU memory, around 256MB for a 5K image. So the absolute minimum Pi would be a Pi 2. But for the best results a Pi 3B+ or 4 would be the boards to aim for.\n   If you \u2019re really serious about using a Pi to capture really good images, the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera is your best choice. At $50 for the module plus at least $15 for a lens, the High Quality Camera doesn \u2019t come cheap, particularly when you can buy the Module V2 for under $30 or third-party modules for less than $10. However, if you can spend the premium, the ability to mount the High Quality Camera to a tripod alone is worth the cost of admission and the higher-quality  ...\n     I&#39;ve noticed this post talks a lot about the ability to focus the lens on the High Quality Camera, and the inability to do so on the V2 Pi Camera, however you can change the focus on the V2 Pi Camera. Earlier models of the camera (and most third-party clones) have the focus fixed with a dot of glue (even these can be adjusted with enough effort, though I wouldn&#39;t want to suggest everyone do that - it&#39;s definitely worth just grabbing a V2 camera) but the V2 Pi Camera module is a lot easier  ...\n   Reply", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:50:50", "tags": "\u76f8\u673a,raspberry

"note_en": "Canonical, the parent company of \u00a0 Ubuntu Linux, is doing better than ever according to\u00a0 founder and CEO Mark Shuttleworth. Indeed, Canonical is now &#34;self-sustaining.&#34; That is, &#34;We&#39;re now well past the point where Ubuntu and all its supporting systems and infrastructure are dependent on me, said Shuttleworth. &#34;If I were to meet my maker tomorrow. Ubuntu will continue in the very capable hands of the team at Canonical and the community.&#34;\n Canonical is a private company, wholly owned by Shuttleworth, so we don&#39;t know its financial details. However, because the company is based on the Isle of Man, it&#39;s incorporated and registered through the  UK Companies House. and must still file an annual report.\n These reports, unlike US public company reports under the  Security and Exchanges Commission, aren&#39;t timely. The  latest annual Canonical report, for example, was filed on October 15, 2019, and only covers the company&#39;s finances through December 31, 2018.\n While Canonical doesn&#39;t have the kind of revenue Red Hat has--almost a  billion dollars of revenue a quarter its last quarter before being acquired by IBM--the company has been profitable. In the first nine months of Canonical&#39;s 2019 fiscal year, the company had $83.43-million in gross revenue with $10.85-million in profits. A closer look reveals that Canonical has been profitable since 2018.\n Canonical&#39;s numbers don&#39;t look as impressive as Red Hat&#39;s revenue because, Shuttleworth noted, &#34;Ubuntu is much cheaper than RHEL.&#34; Another reason is that many corporate Linux users run their servers without contractual support. For example, while Ubuntu is easily the single most popular  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Linux instance according to  Cloud Market&#39;s latest analysis of operating systems, many of those instances are being run without  Ubuntu Advantagesupport  ...\n   That may change. Beginning with the  Ubuntu 20.04 release, Canonical now offers\u00a0 10 years of support for both the base operating system and 30,000 other associated open-source programs. It&#39;s a very attractive offering for companies that have committed to Linux. Shuttleworth said, &#34;Our strength is in the cloud. In the public clouds, we see tremendous demand.&#34;\n Shuttleworth still plans on taking Canonical public.\u00a0 But, there won&#39;t be a  Canonical Initial Public Offering (IPO) anytime soon. Shuttleworth explained:\n We are taking a cautious posture this year because it&#39;s difficult for us to know that&#39;s going on with our customers. We&#39;ve set specific targets for revenue and growth rates as preconditions effectively for an IPO. We feel we&#39;re very privileged in the way we operate makes us resilient in the face of the challenges of the pandemic. But of course our customers may be impacted. it&#39;s difficult for us to predict that now. I think we&#39;re now we will start to see the very  ...\n   Still, Shuttleworth remains certain Canonical and Ubuntu will prosper. As  TechRepublic columnist Matt Asay wrote, &#34; organizations will turn to open source as they seek to do more with less. They&#39;re not the only ones who see it that way. Dr. Dries Buytaert, co-founder and CTO of  Acquia, the  Drupal-based content management system (CMS) company observed, businesses turn to open source, because when an &#34;Economic downturn happens,  organizations, they have to lower their costs.  ...\n Ubuntu is already popular, affordable and works well on desktops, clouds, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Other businesses will face trouble in the upcoming recession, Canonical won&#39;t be one of them.

"note_en": "This is the COVID-19 CovidSim microsimulation model developed by the MRC Centre for GlobalInfectious Disease Analysis hosted at Imperial College, London.\n CovidSim models the transmission dynamics and severity of COVID-19 infections throughout a spatially and socially structuredpopulation over time. It enables modelling of how intervention policies andhealthcare provision affect the spread of COVID-19. With parameter changes, it can be usedto model other respiratory viruses, such as influenza.\n   \u26a0\ufe0f This model is in active development and so parameter name and behaviours, and output file formats will change without notice.\n \u26a0\ufe0f The model is stochastic. Multiple runs with different seeds should be undertaken to see average behaviour.\n \u26a0\ufe0f As with any mathematical model, it is easy to misconfigure inputs and therefore get meaningless outputs. The Imperial College COVID-19 team only endorses outputs it has itself generated.\n      Running the model for the whole of the UK requires approximately 20GB of RAM.Other regions will require different amounts of memory (some up to 256GB).\n It is strongly recommended to build the model with OpenMP support enabled toimprove performance on multi-core processors. 24 to 32 core Xeon systems giveoptimal performance for large (e.g. UK, US) populations.\n    IMPORTANT: This script uses test data only and is not a run reflective ofreal-world situations.\n   The Python script  run_sample.py demonstrates how to invokeCovidSim to use this data. See the  sample README fordetails on how to run the samples.\n    Given the entire Imperial College team is working full-time on the COVID-19 response, documentation is currently sparse. More documentation and sample files will be added as time permits. In the coming few weeks this will include a much more extensive set of input files to model strategies for exiting lockdown.\n  The following papers are relevant to the model. Please note that some of themmay require a subscription.\n    It is Copyright Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine.

"note_en": "After school board in Alaska pulls books by authors including F Scott Fitzgerald from the curriculum, local businesses are working to encourage reading them\n    A school board in Alaska has got more than it bargained for after pulling classics including The Great Gatsby and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings from the school curriculum, with members of the local community offering incentives to students to read the books anyway \u2013 including $100 (\u00a380) prizes and free mac\u2019n\u2019cheese.\n The Matanuska-Susitna borough school board in Palmer, Alaska, which oversees 46 schools, voted last week to remove five books from its curriculum for high-school English: F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s The Great Gatsby, Maya Angelou\u2019s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Joseph Heller\u2019s Catch-22, Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man, and short-story collection The Things They Carried by Tim O\u2019Brien. According to  local paper the Frontiersman News, five members voted in favour of the removal, and two voted against. The  ...\n According to  a flier from the district\u2019s Office of Instruction, Angelou \u2019s memoir had been challenged over its \u201csexually explicit material, such as the sexual abuse the author suffered as a child, and its \u2018anti-white \u2019messaging \u201d, while Fitzgerald \u2019s classic novel was pulled for \u201clanguage and sexual references \u201d. Invisible Man was marked for containing \u201clanguage, rape and incest \u201d, while Catch-22 was included for its violence, \u201ca handful of racial slurs \u201dand the fact the characters \u201cspeak with  ...\n But locals have protested the removal by promoting the books far and wide. Bookstore Fireside Books has been raising funds to get the books out to young readers locally,  a digital book club has been set up to discuss the titles, the  Mat-Su Valley Banned Book Challenge is offering a $100 prize to those students who read all five titles, and local food truck  DallyMac &amp; Cheese will give a free mac\u2019n\u2019cheese to students who present a one-page report on any of the books.\n \u201cBy providing these books to MatSu Borough students, we aim to: broaden horizons, foster critical thinking, encourage healthy debate and discussion, nurture empathy and understanding, advocate engagement in social issues, enable independent thought [and] challenge censorship,\u201d wrote Fireside Books on Facebook, adding that \u201cmany concerned individuals from far and wide\u201d had donated money to pay for books to be distributed to children.\n \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge response from the community,\u201d  Mary Ann Cockle, owner of the store, told CNN. \u201cThe outpouring of support and concern about banning and censorship has been quite a surprise \u2013 but in a good way.\u201d\n The board was criticised by Palmer city council member Sabrena Combs, who told CNN that describing the topics covered by the books as \u201ctoo harsh or too scary\u201d was \u201cabsurd, because then you end up with kids that graduate and have no idea what any experience outside of their own could possibly be\u201d.\n She also slammed the timing of the meeting, which was livestreamed because of the coronavirus pandemic, saying the board had tried to slip it \u201cunder the radar\u201d.\n Jeff Taylor, one of the board members to vote for the books to be removed,  stressed on Facebook that the books had not been banned, rather removed from the approved reading list. But he said that Covid-19 had made public interaction around the issue difficult, and acknowledged that the livestream \u201cdid not facilitate a quick public response\u201d.\n Taylor, who admitted to only having read The Great Gatsby from the selection of five books, said he wanted to \u201cgive parents more freedom, control, and involvement in determining what their children read\u201d.\n \u201cI have no doubt that these books will be read more in the near future than they have been in the recent past. There are even rewards being offered, by private entities, for those who read them,\u201d  he wrote. \u201cI applaud those who choose to read these books on their own accord. I applaud parents and caregivers who are involved in their student \u2019s education. I applaud teachers who truly want to help students learn.

"note_en": "Investments made in internet technologies over the last several decades have given rise to products and services used everyday by billions of people, including messaging, video conferencing, ecommerce and everything in between. We think it \u2019s important to keep investing in the long-term development of the internet to address the needs of the coming decades. That \u2019s why we \u2019re excited to announce a new $515 million fund that will be used to invest in crypto networks and businesses. Here are some  ...\n  The payments system we use today was designed more than a half-century ago, and the way we transfer and distribute value has lots of room for improvement. Transferring   actual  value quickly and cheaply without a third party, in much the same way we currently transfer data like emails or photos, will soon be technologically possible at scale.\n Payment blockchains are picking up where Bitcoin left off, solving for currency volatility and settlement transaction times.  In contrast to services like Venmo or PayPal where a digital IOU is sent in place of actual money, here the recipient possesses the actual value without third-party dependencies once you click \u201csend. \u201dCryptocurrencies are like cash in this way: the bits and bytes are themselves the bearer instrument. Unlike existing systems where the sender and receiver must have fee-extracting  ...\n And for the rest of us who use legacy payment options like banks and credit cards that are \u201cgood enough, \u201dnew systems could provide a much needed upgrade, significantly reducing friction (unnecessary fees, call centers, faxes, delays, privacy breaches, and generally antiquated processes) and providing a more delightful and modern user experience. Turning money into pure bits also allows software developers to creatively design new services around money the way they have done with photos and text.  ...\n  Consumers, particularly digitally native users and those in places where the currency isn\u2019t stable, want a modern store of value that is scarce, secure, durable, portable, and censorship-resistant. Even those of us in stable economies are increasingly skeptical of the government\u2019s ability to manage the money supply. Gold has long played the role of a fiat substitute, but   Bitcoin  is a digital alternative that is gaining acceptance and adoption around the world.\n  DeFi is a new stack of financial services \u2013\u2013 think lending, derivatives, insurance, trading, crowdfunding, and more \u2013\u2013 built on top of blockchains that embraces the core values of the open internet, including 1) open access to anyone in the world; 2) commitment to open source code; 3) permissionless extensibility by third-party developers; 4) minimal-to-no fees; and 5) encryption-backed security and privacy.\n DeFi has been rapidly adopted by early users and developers. Users have deployed hundreds of millions of dollars in leading   DeFi   protocols , while developers have embraced DeFi\u2019s open and rich design space. One of the main forces that has driven the rise of open-source software is   composability \u2013\u2013the ability to remix and recombine software components. With programmable trust, scarcity, and value as new building blocks, DeFi opens the components of finance to the same recombination and experimentation  ...\n  Over the internet\u2019s history, many new business models have been invented, including banner ads, search ads, video ads,   in-app payments , and digital subscriptions. Each new business model helped fund a new set of digital services and a new source of income for creators.\n We think the next wave of internet business models will come from crypto. Rather than engaging audiences through centralized gatekeepers that charge high rents and create self-serving rules, creators can use token models that bypass gatekeepers and give their fans a direct stake in their success.\n Today the video game industry is on the leading edge of this trend, experimenting with things like   digital goods  that can be traded on secondary markets and transferred between games.  In the near future, we expect crypto monetization models to be applied to other creative activities \u2013\u2013 including writing, music, podcasting, programming, design, and more.\n  One of the key reasons the internet is such a powerful invention is that, because it is primarily   software-based , new networks can be created on top of it. Originally this meant networks based on open protocols like email and the web. More recently this has meant corporate-owned networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Uber.\n Companies that own networks have unilateral power over important questions like who gets network access, how revenue is divided up, what features are supported, how user data is secured, and so on. This creates tension as corporate interests often diverge from the interests of those who depend on the network, including users, developers, businesses, and creators.\n Blockchains enable the creation of decentralized networks that make strong   commitments  \u2013\u2013 baked into the architecture of the network itself \u2013\u2013 as to how control and money will be distributed among network participants. \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d is   replaced  by \u201ccan\u2019t be evil.\u201d An early example of this are   storage networks  where the economics are shared across the community, and deplatforming decisions are made by community members instead of corporate committees.\n We are still early in this   Web 3  build-out. High-performance programmable blockchains will make decentralized network development much more accessible. After years of R&amp;D, we are excited that a number of next-gen programmable blockchains will begin rolling out in the near future.\n  These are a few areas where people are already building, but it only scratches the surface of the yet-to-be-imagined applications that entrepreneurs will dream up. In the same way that it wasn\u2019t obvious in 2007 how applications on top of mobile phones would change so many aspects of the ways in which we move, consume, travel, communicate, and even date, it\u2019s hard to imagine what the very best apps and use cases will be for blockchain-based computing platforms.\n In just a decade of existence, crypto has gone through several waves. With each new wave, the applications of crypto extend to a greater number of categories and more visionary entrepreneurs enter the space. If you\u2019re one of them, we\u2019d love to hear from you.\n  The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

"note_en": "Messaging app Telegram postponed the launch of its TON blockchain for a second time on Wednesday, pushing the new go-live date to April 2021 and triggering a costly clawback clause in its agreement with token-sale investors.\n According to a letter to investors obtained by CoinDesk, Telegram is offering to return up to 72% of each investor&#39;s stake. The terms were agreed upon when Telegram first postponed TON&#39;s launch in October,  following a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charging Telegram with running an unregistered securities sale that raked in $1.7 billion in 2018. At the time, Telegram set a revised launch deadline of April 30, 2020.\n The company lost an initial court battle with the SEC, with a U.S. judge ruling Telegram can&#39;t launch its blockchain or issue its forthcoming &#34;gram&#34; tokens until the case was resolved. On March 24, the initial preliminary injunction was  left in place.\n On Wednesday, however, Telegram floated another option for those investors who choose to forego their 72%: They can lend their investment to Telegram until this time next year.\n The letter states: &#34;As a token of gratitude for your trust in TON, we are also offering you an alternative option to receive 110% of your original investment by April 30, 2021, which is 53% higher than the Termination Amount.&#34;\n  Telegram is &#34;continuing to engage in discussions with the relevant authorities,&#34; the letter continues. Depending on how the negotiations go, those investors could still receive &#34;grams or potentially another cryptocurrency on the same terms as those in their original Purchase Agreements.&#34;\n If regulators continue blocking the launch of TON, Telegram will repay the debt using equity. At present, the company is entirely owned by its founder and CEO, Pavel Durov. Citing Telegram&#39;s recent growth to 400 million monthly users, the company believes its &#34;equity value will exceed the aggregate amount of its potential debt resulting from this offer by at least several times.&#34;\n  Sergey Solonin, the founder of payment processing firm QIWI and a $17 million investor in TON, said it&#39;s good news for investors.\n &#34;The terms are really good, I think a lot of investors will choose to keep their money in Telegram,&#34; he said, citing the promise of additional returns.\n &#34;There is definitely capital value there, and even if Telegram will ultimately not be allowed to issue grams, I think, in the course of this year [it] can find an investor and pay the money back [to the token purchasers],&#34; Solonin said.\n Two fund managers told CoinDesk last week that many investors, especially the Silicon Valley venture funds, would prefer to have their token allocations converted into Telegram shares. For some VCs, the tokens have essentially been a proxy for Telegram\u2019s equity, which the company was previously unwilling to sell.\u00a0Selling equity had been not an option for Durov, they said.\n After the March 24 ruling, Telegram went completely silent, making no communications with TON investors until the eleventh hour, according to several investors.\n  According to several sources close to the Telegram team, the company had been planning to launch the project just days before the final decision to postpone.\n On Tuesday, fresh commits had been added to the Telegram Open Network (TON)  repository on GitHub, including new documentation on running validator nodes.\n Also around that time, the website  ton.org went online, duplicating the information earlier published on  test.ton.org, which contained code for the TON testnet. Meanwhile, TON Labs, a tech partner of Telegram that helped build the testnet,  announced TON OS, &#34;an end-to-end open source infrastructure designed to enable developers and users to work with TON blockchain.&#34;\n  Several companies have been also planning to support TON and its tokens at launch, which, they believed was about to happen earlier this week, the sources told CoinDesk. Seychelles-based Poloniex published an intriguing  tweet Wednesday night announcing &#34;new listings&#34; with Telegram&#39;s signature paper plane icon.\n However, according to Carlton Fields attorney Andrew Hinkes, doing so could have drawn additional ire from the U.S. courts. By launching, Telegram would have violated its injunction, which could lead to the judge appointing a receiver or external manager for the company.\n &#34;If the Court finds that the injunction was violated (whether intentionally or otherwise) it has broad discretion to fashion a remedy that would either coerce compliance or compensate the party seeking to enforce the injunction, including fines and incarceration,&#34; Hinkes said, though he noted the receiver appointment would be difficult to enforce for a non-U.S. company.\n In the meantime, some TON investors and developers launched a  TON Community Foundation, an informal group that has been preparing to launch its own fork of TON in case Telegram wouldn&#39;t be able to do so.\n The group  launched its own testnet version in mid-April, becoming the third TON testnet to go live following those rolled out by Telegram itself and TON Labs.\n Telegram kept developing TON throughout the legal fight with the SEC, releasing code for TON  blockchain nodes, a technical paper on  TON&#39;s consensus protocol and a  native crypto wallet. Telegram even ran several  contests for blockchain developers challenging programmers to code wallets, games and other applications for the TON blockchain.\n   The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a  strict set of editorial policies.
