"note_en": "This is definitely not a &#34;learn distributed systems in 21 days&#34; post. I recommend a principled, from the foundations-up, studying of distributed systems, which will take a good three months in the first pass, and many more months to build competence after that.  If you are practical and coding oriented you may not like my advice much. You may object saying, &#34;Shouldn&#39;t I learn distributed systems with coding and hands on? Why can I not get started by deploying a Hadoop cluster, or studying the Raft code.&#34; I think that is the wrong way to go about learning distributed systems, because seeing similar code and programming language constructs will make you think this is familiar territory, and will give you a false sense of security. But, nothing can be further than the truth.   This quotation is literally the first sentence in my distributed systems syllabus. Instead of trying to relate distributed systems constructs to centralized constructs, you should treat distributed systems as  a radical novelty. You should first dive into the inherent difficulties (reasoning about concurrency and fault-tolerance) in distributed system, rather than dipping your toe in the accidental difficulties (implementation of a framework).  For a principled foundations-up studying of distributed systems, this is what I recommend.   To appreciate the challenges of reasoning with concurrency, it is important to start with a quick crash course on  predicate logic, and reasoning about safety properties (next, stable, invariant), and liveness properties (transient, ensures, leads-to, variant functions).   Paolo Sivilotti, who was a student of one of the creators of the\u00a0 UNITY pseudocode and reasoning framework, has a nice pedagogical approach to teach these concepts in his book,  which is available as a free download. I use this book for the first month of my classes. (Thank you Paul!)  This may look like grunt work to you, as it does to many of my students. But let me tell you, as I tell them, this is what you need to learn/internalize first so you can start to do dist-sys kungfu. (To motivate students for this legwork, I show students  scenes from Karate Kid.)   After this background on reasoning about safety and progress, you can start using TLA+/Pluscal framework where you can write distributed algorithms and the model checker can tell you what a fool you are.  You can find information about how TLA+ can help you when learning about your distributed systems in  many posts in my blog.\u00a0   Hillel&#39;s TLA+ introduction website is great for getting you started. After that you can read through  many books and videos Lamport has made available for free.   I then recommend studying the impossibility results in distributed systems. There is nothing better than seeing how you can&#39;t do even the most basic coordination tasks under common failure employments to drive the point home that  There are two big impossibility results,  coordinated attack and  FLP impossibility results.  The coordinating attack result says that if the communication channels can drop messages you cannot solve distributed consensus using a deterministic protocol in finite rounds. OK, let&#39;s assume reliable, or eventually for a sufficient period \u00a0reliable channels. Pow! In your face. FLP shows that even with reliable channels, under an asynchronous model, you cannot solve distributed consensus using a deterministic protocol in finite rounds, in the presence of a single crash failure. CAP theorem considers the coordinating attack model for the atomic storage problem, an easier problem than distributed consensus, and shows that with arbitrarily unreliable channels, you cannot solve the atomic storage problem either.   To provide a smooth introduction to the impossibility results, I use  the two-phase commit as a working example, and show via TLA+ modeling how these impossibility results play out in the context of the simple two-phase commit protocol.   After you learn these impossibility results, you can then start to learn about ways to circumvent (not to beat) these impossibility results. And that takes us to the consensus and fault-tolerance discussion.  I am unable to point to a good textbook for a good coverage of the impossibility results and distributed consensus and atomic storage protocols. Let me know if you know a textbook that provides a good coverage of these topics. A supplementary free pdf book is Maarten van Steen Andrew S. Tanenbaum. Distributed Systems. Freely available from  https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/ds3/  From now on, you should try to read the original research papers and competent blog posts that explain them. Some blogs I can recommend are:   It is good to follow up the impossibility results with  the Paxos protocol and variants to show how they skillfully circumvent these results.  It takes considerable time to  learn Paxos well. But\u00a0one day you finally understand Paxos and feel things fall into place, and you will celebrate your victory. But you should know that this is a premature celebration. You will need to be confused and re-learn the algorithm several times before you  properly internalize it.\u00a0(I think I have more than\u00a0 100 posts related to Paxos one way or another, including\u00a0 a post about Paxos jokes.)  You can learn about failure detectors and fault-tolerance in a hands-on manner during learning about Paxos and distributed consensus. They can go hand in hand, so your study of failure detectors and fault-tolerance can build on some concrete ground.  Along with these, you can also study about many Paxos variants, Replicated State Machines (RSM), and chain replication type advanced atomic storage protocols.   We delayed studying about time and state, but it is now time to look at this, otherwise we will be in a regretful state.   The &#34;There is no now&#34; article provides a coverage of difficulties and practical implications of dealing with time and state in distributed systems.    Logical clocks, vector clocks,  hybrid logical clocks are fun to learn. (Paul&#39;s book includes a good explanation of logical and vector clocks and snapshots.) They form the basis on which CRDTs, version vectors in NoSQL databases, and snapshot reads and commits in distributed SQL databases build upon.    Now start reading about and hacking on cloud computing frameworks, NoSQL databases, and stream processing platforms.\u00a0 Martin Klepman&#39;s Designing Data Intensive Applications book is helpful for some of these topics.  Other than that, you are again on your own for gathering information from good blog posts and relevant research papers. Going to the original research paper, and learning from first principles are invaluable. This post is about where to start. I hope I can write another post to give a list of important papers for each topic I touched on this post.  These being said, I think we are over due for a book on modern distributed systems, that distills all recent developments and presents them in one place. Distributed systems concepts are tricky, and a bit help from an expert teacher can save a lot of frustration and many hours for each concept/topic.", "posttime": "2020-06-10 21:51:22",

"note_en": "When  I began what I called the knowledge bootstrapping project, my ultimate goal was \u201cLearn how to learn a subject from scratch, without deference to credentialed authorities\u201d. That was too large and unpredictable for a single grant, so when I applied to   LTFF , my stated goal was \u201clearn how to study a single book\u201d, on the theory that books are the natural subcomponents of learning (discounting papers because they\u2019re too small). This turned out to have a flawed assumption baked into it.\n As will be described in a forthcoming post, the method I eventually landed upon involves starting with a question, not a book. If I start with a book and investigate the questions it brings up (you know, like I\u2019ve been doing for the last 3-6 years), the book is controlling which questions get brought up. That\u2019s a lot of power to give to something I have explicitly decided not to trust yet.\n  When reading   The Unbound Prometheus , I took the book\u2019s word that a lower European birth rate would prove Europeans were more rational than Asians and focused on determining whether Europe\u2019s birth rates were in fact lower (answer: it\u2019s complicated), when on reflection it\u2019s not at all clear to me that lower birth rates are evidence of rationality.\n \u201cDo humans have exactly 4 hours of work per day in them?\u201d is not actually a very useful question. What I really wanted to know is \u201cwhen can I stop beating myself up for not working?\u201c, and   the answer  to the former doesn\u2019t really help me with the latter. Even if humans on average have 4 hours, that doesn\u2019t mean I do, and of course it varies by circumstances and type of work\u2026 and even \u201cwhen can I stop beating myself up?\u201d has some pretty problematic assumptions built into it, such as \u201cbeating myself up will produce more work, which is good.\u201d The real question is something like \u201chow can I approach my day to get the most out of it?\u201d, and the research I did on verifying a paper on average daily work capacity didn\u2019t inform the real question one way or the other.\n  What would have been better is if I\u2019d started with the actual question I wanted to answer, and then looked for books that had information bearing on that question (including indirectly, including very indirectly). This is what I\u2019ve started doing.\n This can look very different depending on what type of research I\u2019m doing. When I started doing covid research, I generated a long list of   \u00a0fairly shallow questions .\u00a0 Most of these questions were designed to inform specific choices, like \u201cwhen should I wear what kind of mask?\u201d and \u201chow paranoid should I be about people without current symptoms?\u201d, but some of them were broader and designed to inform multiple more specific questions, such as \u201cwhat is the basic science of coronavirus?\u201d. These broader, more basic questions helped me judge the information I used to inform the more specific, actionable questions (e.g., I saw a claim that covid lasted forever in your body the same way HIV does, which I could immediately dismiss because I knew HIV inserted itself your DNA and coronaviruses never enter the nucleus).\n    I used to read a lot of nonfiction for leisure. Then I started doing   epistemic spot checks \u2013 taking selected claims from a book and investigating them for truth value, to assess the book\u2019s overall credibility- and stopped being able to read nonfiction without doing that, unless it was one of a very short list of authors who\u2019d made it onto my trust list. I couldn\u2019t take the risk that I was reading something false and would absorb it as if it were true (or true but unrepresentative, and absorb it as representative). My time spent reading nonfiction went way down.\n About 9 months ago I started taking   really rigorous notes  when I read nonfiction. The gap in quality of learning between rigorous notes and my previous mediocre notes was about the same as the gap between doing an epistemic spot check and not. My time spent reading nonfiction went way up (in part because I was studying the process of doing so), but my volume of words read dropped precipitously.\n And then three months ago I shifted from my unit of inquiry being \u201ca book\u201d, to being \u201ca question\u201d. I\u2019m sure you can guess where this is going- I read fewer words, but gained more understanding per word, and especially more core (as opposed to shell or test) understanding.\n The first two shifts happened naturally, and while I missed reading nonfiction for fun and with less effort, I didn\u2019t feel any pull towards the old way after I discovered the new way. Giving up book-centered reading has been hard. Especially after five weeks of frantic covid research, all I wanted to do was to be sat down and told what questions were important, and perhaps be walked through some plausible answers. I labeled this a desire to learn, but when I compared it to question-centered research, it became clear that\u2019s not what it was. Or maybe it was a desire to go through the act of learning something, but it was not a desire to answer a question I had and was not prioritized by the importance of a question. It was best classified as leisure in the form of learning, not resolving a curiosity I had.\u00a0 And if I wanted leisure, better to consume something easier and less likely to lead me astray, so I started reading more fiction, and the rare non-fiction of a type that did not risk polluting my pool of data. And honestly I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s so safe: humans are built to extract lessons from fiction too.\n Put another way: I   goal factored  (figured out what I actually wanted from) reading a nonfiction book, and the goal was almost never best served by using a nonfiction book as a starting point. Investigating a question I cared about was almost always better for learning (even if it did eventually cash out in reading a book), and fiction was almost always better for leisure, in part because it was less tiring, and thus left more energy for question-centered learning when that was what I wanted.", "posttime": "2020-06-10 21:50:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

"note_en": "by  Sid Perkins Before the steam engine was invented, there were three sources of usable power: wind, water, and animals. The first of these to be harnessed -- literally -- was animal.\n      This feature story appeared on pp. 90-92  of the May 21, 1999, issue of  The Chronicle of the Horse.     On land, humans in cultures throughout the world have used horses, oxen, donkeys and other domesticated animals to pull everything from plows to sleds. Horses alone, however, became the backbone of man&#39;s transportation network -- their combination of speed, endurance and demeanor made them the prime mover for everyone from Roman charioteers to marauding Mongol hordes.  On the waters, however, it was a different story. Most people simply don&#39;t think of animals as a likely source of power for boats. Those that do probably recall horse- or mule-drawn barges like those used on the Erie Canal in the 1800s. But a much more common -- and yet almost unknown -- form of American transportation from that same time period was the horse-powered ferry.  Several different types of these amazing boats, which usually used teams of two or more horses as their &#34;engine,&#34; plied the waterways of North America from the 1790s until the late 1920s. The horse ferries were most plentiful more than 150 years ago, however, and consequently have been forgotten by many.  In 1983, nautical archaeologists discovered what they suspected to be a horse-powered ferry on the bottom of Vermont&#39;s Burlington Bay. Researchers spent portions of four consecutive summers diving on the well-preserved wreck, years studying the data they obtained, and more than a decade unearthing the often hard-to-find history of these horse-powered marvels.  Kevin J. Crisman, an associate professor of nautical archaeology at Texas A&amp;M University, and Arthur B. Cohn, director of the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum in Vergennes, Vt., were two of the archaeologists who excavated and studied the Burlington Bay Horse Ferry. The fascinating results of their research were published in the summer of 1998 in the book  When Horses Walked On Water: Horse-Powered Ferries in Nineteenth-Century America.          Europeans were the first to build watercraft powered by animals. Roman engineers had designed an oxen-powered boat as early as the 4th century A.D., but no records show if that boat -- or one like it -- was ever constructed.  Crisman and Cohn&#39;s research indicates that the first animal-powered vessel to make it off the drawing board was a horse-powered boat built in England around 1680 by a cousin of King Charles II. This boat, or one of a similar design, later served as a towboat in one of the Royal Navy&#39;s dockyards, where the craft (powered by four to eight horses) was reportedly capable of towing even the largest ships in the Royal Navy.  Although the English towboat proved that the concept of animal-powered watercraft was feasible, this experiment -- as well as others that took place in Europe during the 18th century -- failed to stimulate a lasting revolution in boat design.   At that time, most areas of Europe already had a well-developed system of roads, bridges and canals. In places where ferries were needed, boats powered either by sails or by human muscle had been operating efficiently for hundreds of years. Also, a relatively dense population ensured that the manpower needed to power such boats was both plentiful and cheap.  But Crisman and Cohn note that Colonial America had none of these benefits. As the United States entered the 1800s, it had a relatively small population that was spread across a broad, rugged landscape. There were no roads into the frontier; explorers and settlers used America&#39;s waterways as their highways and ferryboats as their bridges. The manpower to row such boats was scarce, and the winds needed to drive sailboats weren&#39;t always reliable.  To help solve these problems, Americans turned to technology. Both steam- and horse-powered boats were first introduced to American waterways in the late 1780s and &#39;90s, but the commercial success of either wouldn&#39;t come for another 20 years. And even though the steamboat represented a more advanced technology, it did not immediately make the horseboat obsolete. Ironically, in several ways the steamboat provided a major incentive for the horse-powered boat&#39;s further development.  First, state and local governments sought to encourage the rapid development of steamboat technology; they often did this by granting long-term monopolies on steamboat navigation routes to inventors or businessmen who were the first to successfully establish a steamboat company or ferry.  Second, the steamboats created the expectation of speedy and regular service. Once the steamboat monopoly was in place, potential competitors had no choice but to resort to other sources of power, the most reliable of which was animal power.          Horses powered the earliest generation of American horseboats by walking in circles on the deck about stationary posts, or whims. This type of mechanism had been used on land for thousands of years for a variety of purposes, such as grinding grain, pressing olives, and pumping water.  On the horse-powered boats, however, the power from the whims drove various types of propulsion devices. Although some used screw-type propellers or duck-leg paddles that moved to and fro, most of the whim-type ferries used paddlewheels to propel the boat.  Crisman and Cohn found that the whim-style horseboats operated in many parts of North America, including Halifax, Nova Scotia; Philadelphia, Pa.; Washington, D.C.; and St. Louis, Mo.  In New York City, horseboats successfully competed with steamboats in the thriving business of ferrying passengers from lower Manhattan to Brooklyn and to New Jersey. At least eight different horseboat ferry routes operated from docks in southern Manhattan in the years between 1814 and 1819.  Newspaper accounts from the time tell of one ferry, powered by eight horses, that could carry more than 200 passengers across the East River in 8 to 18 minutes, about the same time it took a steamboat to travel the same route.  The financial advantages of a horseboat were obvious: While a steamboat could cost about $30,000 to build, a horseboat -- complete with extra horses and a stable on shore -- could cost as little as $12,000.  Even though horseboats were much cheaper than steamboats, they still had their disadvantages. The whims and the circular walkways for the horses took up a lot of deck space. To solve this problem, designers often built a catamaran-style boat with one wide deck atop two small hulls. Even with a wider deck, however, the horses had to walk incessantly in small circles, which wasn&#39;t good for them.  An innovation patented by Barnabas Langdon in 1819 -- the treadwheel-propelled horseboat -- solved both of these problems.  Langdon placed a rotating turntable slightly below the level of the boat&#39;s deck; horses stood atop the turntable through large slots in the deck and drove the wheel backward by walking in place. This design eased the burden on the horses, freed up valuable deck space, and allowed the ferry to be built atop one hull.       Sketch by Kevin J. Crisman   Cross-sectional view and top view (with deck planking removed) of the Burlington Bay Horse Ferry, which show the horizontal turntable beneath the boat&#39;s main deck.  Horseboats that used the horizontal treadwheels were both reliable and cheap, and they quickly became the most common type of horseboat for more than 20 years. They were used well into the 1850s in many locations in New England and the Mid-Atlantic, and at least a dozen such ferries crossed the Hudson River.  Treadwheel horseboats were also used to cross Maine&#39;s Kennebec River and to ferry passengers between the islands in Rhode Island&#39;s Narragansett Bay.  In the early 1830s, inventors began to develop horse-powered inclined treadmills that farmers could use, with various attachments, to saw wood, churn butter, and pump water. Manufacturers began to produce these devices in large quantities in the 1840s, and competition for business caused the price of treadmills to drop steadily.       Sketch from an advertisement in the June 1852 issue of  Cultivator   Inclined treadmills were originally invented in the 1830s as labor-saving devices for the farm, but they were soon adapted to serve as a power supply for paddlewheels on boats.  Most of these treadmills were light, portable, cheap, and easy to maintain because replacement parts were readily available. The treadmills revolutionized the design of horse ferries: They could easily be attached to the sides of a boat&#39;s hull and need not be &#34;built-in&#34; beneath the deck like the horizontal treadwheels.  Most of these new horse ferry designs had two treadmills, with one on each side of the boat driving its own paddlewheel. But there was one drawback of this design: If the horses walked at different speeds, the paddlewheels would turn at different rates and the boat would travel in large circles!   Ferrymen found ways to overcome this disadvantage, however, and inclined treadmills, due to economics and ease of maintenance, powered most horseboats built after 1850.          The Northeast was heavily industrialized by the 1860s. In the last years of the 19th century, bridge construction and the ever-expanding network of railroads led to an inevitable decline in the number of horse ferries. Then the internal combustion engine -- the power source that also doomed the steam engine -- was the final nail in the horse ferry&#39;s coffin.  Crisman and Cohn say that the last horse ferry to operate in North America may have been a small treadmill ferry powered by a single blind horse, which provided the &#34;horsepower&#34; to shuttle passengers across the Cumberland River at Rome, Tenn., until the late 1920s.  Lake Champlain in New York was &#34;discovered&#34; by French explorers in 1609. And a significant amount of this country&#39;s early nautical history took place on this long and narrow lake, which forms much of the border between New York and Vermont. Lake Champlain hosted numerous naval battles between French and British ships during the next 150 years.  The fledgling U.S. Navy, which was first established at the southern tip of Lake Champlain in 1776, fought British warships on the lake during both the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.  In June of 1984, underwater archaeologists sponsored by the Champlain Maritime Society and the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation conducted a sonar survey of Lake Champlain to locate and inventory its shipwrecks. The researchers chose to focus part of their survey in Burlington Bay, Vt., because the area was a commerce hub in the 19th century. Several wrecks had already been found in the bay, including a variety of sailing craft and canal boats.  One wreck, however, was of particular interest to the scientists. During the previous summer, a privately-sponsored sonar survey had discovered an unusual wreck: a boat that had a pair of paddlewheels but no evidence of a boiler or steam engine. In their report to Vermont&#39;s state archaeologist, they suspected they had stumbled upon a horse-powered ferry.  The 1984 expedition found that the wreck, which lay in about 50 feet of water in the northern part of the bay, was wonderfully preserved. The sonar showed that a seemingly complete arrangement of iron gears and shafts led from the paddlewheels to a large, spoked wheel that lay beneath the boat&#39;s deck. Scuba divers photographed the entire wreck that year, but little additional fieldwork was conducted for another five years.  In September of 1989, Vermont&#39;s Division of Historic Preservation initiated a four-year program of detailed archaeological study at the site. Four scuba divers took measurements, and they studied the treadwheel-paddlewheel propulsion system.  In 1990, divers removed sediments from the inside of the bow and found artifacts, including fragments of a horse collar, pieces of leather harness straps, and several broken horseshoes. The size of the shoes and the general design of the boat indicate that two small or medium-sized horses powered the Burlington Bay Horse Ferry.  Further excavations the following summer yielded two clues about what may have happened to this boat on the fateful day it slipped beneath the lake&#39;s surface.  Divers found a spot on the hull where a section of plank was missing, although there was no damage to nearby sections of the boat. Also, the divers found the ferry&#39;s rudder lying under sediments in the bow, about 60 feet from its normal location at the rear of the boat.  Crisman and Cohn say that these facts indicate that the ferry probably was towed just outside the main harbor and then intentionally sunk by knocking a hole in the bottom of the boat.  Other factors point to a deliberate scuttling of the boat. First, Burlington Bay is located at the widest portion of Lake Champlain, and therefore it is highly unlikely that a ferry powered by only two horses operated from this point on the lake. Second, the ferry showed many signs of a long lifetime of heavy use, including heavily worn gears and a hull that had been worn to only 1/2-inch thick in places.       Sketch by Kevin J. Crisman   A number of horse ferry routes crossed Lake Champlain, but none were known to have operated from Burlington, Vt., which is located at one of the widest spots on the lake.  In 1989, the Burlington Bay Horse Ferry became a part of Vermont&#39;s Underwater Historical Preserve System. The ferry received added protection when it was added to the National Park Service&#39;s National Register of Historical Places in December of 1993. Today, the sunken ferry is visited by hundreds of scuba divers each year.  Crisman and Cohn say that the Burlington Bay Horse Ferry is the only surviving example of a horse-powered vessel anywhere in the world.  Their research, which was spurred by the discovery of a waterlogged wreck that laid beneath the murky waters of Burlington Bay for almost 150 years, has brought to light an almost forgotten mode of transportation used in a far simpler time.  The very thought of a horse-powered ferry brings to mind an era when American technology was young -- a time when people transported their goods by stagecoach and by wagon, a time when the Pony Express surrendered to the telegraph, and a time before the Oregon Trail gave way to the railroad, the minivan and Interstate 80.

"note_en": "After 10 Years in Tech Isolation, I\u2019m Now Outsider to Things I Once Had Mastered\n        The world isn\u2019t the way I remember it, and certainly not the way I left it back when I was arrested in 2009 for installing botnets and commercial remote access programs on a handful of sensitive clinic systems, which included a critical SCADA system.\n  That was  how I became the first person in recent United States history to be convicted for corrupting industrial control systems. It was such a long time ago, but in my mind it only feels like yesterday.\n You have to understand what it means to be a prisoner in the States. There are currently somewhere around 2.3 million people incarcerated in the Land of the Free, and Internet access is not exactly an amenity provided by the Bureau of Prisons.\n  Access to current information is restricted to approved newspapers and magazine publications and television. Most inmates have computer access which uses a specialized access control program that allows them to email approved contacts for .05 cents a minute. However, having access to the public by use of the inmate messaging system was not a privilege I had. Being a hacker in federal prison isn\u2019t all that great.\n In the summer of 2011, I was appealing my sentence. I had no affordable way to contact my attorney, so I worked out a deal with another inmate to let me use his computer, so I could send and receive emails.\n Eventually it caught up with me. The inmate was apprehended by the prisons\u2019 Special Investigative Services (SIS) about the flurry of recent activity from his inmate messaging account. The SIS brought my name up, knowing that I was the one behind the recent activity. He not only played dumb, but told the SIS that he had no idea I was using his account, that I must have hacked into it.\n I was then detained for 13 months in a maximum security administrative segregation unit without due process, while the case was referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Some people refer to these facilities as \u201cBlack Sites\u201d because they are cut off from the media, visitors, and lawyers so that what happens in there, stays in there. Interestingly enough, the Seagoville Federal Correctional Institution was once a Japanese internment camp.\n That\u2019s three showers a week. 23/5 confinement to an 8X10 cell without air conditioning, a fan, or adequate ventilation. That summer the temperature inside my cell reached 125 degrees Fahrenheit. With no evidence to support the inmates\u2019 accusation, I was supposed to be released back into the general population. But to make a long story short, that didn\u2019t happen.\n Could you imagine now having no access to current information for over a year? That would be the least of your worries if you were confined to where I was.\n  In the aftermath of serving a lengthy prison sentence, I witnessed first-hand just how much technology has evolved, and it felt like stepping out of a time-machine. I had been an exile in time, excommunicado from the evolution of new technologies and how our global society has evolved with it.\n As a hacker, I was the founder and leader of the hacker group known as the Electronik Tribulation Army. I used to stay parallel to the latest gadgets, exploits, and socio-technological trends.\n I used to reverse engineer malware, perform incident responses, and hack pretty much anything left unattended. I read about these technological advancements in newspapers and magazines while I served my sentence, but when it comes down to it, I am now a foreigner, an outsider to the very things I once had mastered. To say that the teacher has now become the student is quite the understatement.\n Recently, I was given a new Dell Inspiron laptop. Fresh out of its packaging it feels and looks like a familiar friend to me. But as soon as I booted it up, I was greeted with Windows 10, my new enemy. It only seems like yesterday that the Windows 7 beta was just released. Windows 10 is confusing and weird to me. It has a new file system and I\u2019m not even the slightest curious about how it works. I just want my Windows XP back with my dual boot option of Ubuntu Linux and Backtrack 3.\n The only solution to making me happy again would seem to download Ubuntu, mount it to a USB thumb drive, and get it installed. Had I known that Windows 10 doesn\u2019t utilize BIOS, but has replaced it with UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which is a secure boot option that validates programs before giving them permission to run, I wouldn\u2019t have wasted two more days of my life trying to install my favorite operating system.\n Windows has seized control. Point being: I am no longer in control, and I hate it. I can spend hours on Google troubleshooting through this frustrating dilemma, and still get nowhere. I have to walk away every time, defeated.\n  Other things similarly have changed since I was incarcerated. I had to ask my twelve-year-old daughter what a hashtag was. That was pretty embarrassing. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be a hacker or something?,\u201d she told me, sending a final blow to my dying ego.\n So many things have changed since I\u2019ve exited this proverbial time machine. For example, back in my day being a hacker for hire was considered a taboo. It was dangerous territory. Now it seems that every hacker is for hire to the extent that being a hacker has become a kind of norm, for the good and bad. Bug bounties have become a legitimate and legal source of income for many, as companies grant permission to hackers to test the integrity of their networks for large sums of money.\n Hackers are even eloquently glorified in Hollywood films, books, and video games. Many hackers such as \u201cMr. Robot\u201d on the USA television network are even depicted as heroes instead of the cliche cyber villain. Governments around the globe are arming themselves with digital pirates, cyber soldiers, and saboteurs.\n The proliferation of destructive cyberweapons has become commonplace. It\u2019s become the new way of things. As I probe around the web and observe this new generation of hackers, I see individuals that have lost touch with the true spirit of hacking. A brood that is motivated by greed, revenge, and anger. Harmless curiosity has become a thing of the past.\n  While I remained nostalgic for the familiar things of the past, the world was moving forward in leaps and bounds. Here are some of the things I observed from outside this exciting new world.\n Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency was introduced to the world (I still am uncertain how to obtain Bitcoins or how to use them).\n Smartphones appeared in 2007 but started to replace flip phones in 2009. I am pretty savvy with my Samsung Galaxy A10e. However, I can\u2019t figure out how to root it to save my life. I remember the first time I saw a smartphone advertised on television. \u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing ever!,\u201d I yelled at the TV. \u201cWho\u2019d want to put their greasy fingers all over a screen like that?\u201d Apparently, everybody. Including me.\n President Obama signed an executive order outlining emergency control of the Internet, and thus the Internet kill switch was born. That\u2019s a pretty big deal.\n End-to-end encrypted communication popularized in the wake of the Arab Spring as social awareness began to evolve towards using tools like Tor and encrypted communication platforms for maintaining Internet anonymity.\n The social networking website Myspace plunged into the great abyss, effectively ending the reign of profile building creativity as we know it. Utilitarianism seems to be the default everywhere nowadays.\n Banking trojans became an epidemic. ZeuS. SpyEye. BlackHole and BackSwap to name a few. The availability of IPv4 addresses quickly depleted as more devices were connecting to the Internet. It was the end of the world as we knew it.\n Iraqi insurgents hacked Predator drone feeds using SkyGrabber, an off-the-shelf software.\u00a0 The WikiLeaks movement exploded after a large cache of sensitive state department cables had been leaked by Pfc. Chelsea Manning. The hacker group Anonymous became the hammer and war cry in support of that new revolution.\n The hacker group known as Lulz Sec emerged during a time of revolution, social unrest, and a growing distrust of the U.S. government, the justice system, and economic inequality.\u00a0 This elite splinter group comprised of members from Anonymous began performing impressive sophisticated cyber attacks on high profile targets, embarrassing U.S. law enforcement.\n Edward Snowden, a National Security Agency (NSA) contractor-turned whistleblower, leaked between 9,000 and 10,000 top-secret NSA documents to journalists, exposing a massive spying program called Prism, effectively ending the NSA\u2019s carte blanche operation. Congressional nightmare. Laws were passed. Some people got fired. The U.S. government is still spying. It always will.\n Stuxnet happened. Biggest, baddest computer virus ever. Cripples Iranian nuclear centrifuges, then decided to start spreading elsewhere.\n Big advertisers are using metadata to collect and map any given users\u2019 Internet behaviors for content marketing purposes. I, too, used to steal users\u2019 data. But it was a crime when I did it. Perhaps if I had sent them an ad or two it would have been less illegal?\n Facebook and Google have become so ingrained in the everyday activities of web users that apps and services unrelated to them now feature options to login or register using your Google or Facebook credentials.\n Smarthomes and smart cars are gaining popularity. With all the interconnected devices wirelessly connected into a single command and control device, it\u2019s a hackers field day for sure. Smartwatches and smart rings? Seriously?\n Net Neutrality began in the U.S. as the fight to treat all Internet traffic across all devices with equality Backtrack is discontinued. Kali Linux has taken center stage, even though they\u2019re basically one and the same.\n  Augmented Reality entered the scene with Google Glass. But due to privacy concerns and the hefty price tag, the Glass quickly is discontinued.\n Virtual Reality became affordable to the everyday consumer, conveniently interfacing with smartphones and video game consoles.\n Amazon\u2019s virtual assistant Alexa may have been a witness to a murder. A judge ordered Amazon to hand over the recordings. Yes, always listening. Always recording.\n  Ransomware is resurrected from the past. Criminal hackers began swarming computer users with extortion and corrupting personal data on a vendetta to get rich fast.\n Artificial Intelligence has made a quantum leap. I watched a video on Youtube of Will Smith trying to put the moves on a robot named Sophia.\n Government spooks started openly attending the annual hacker conventions Black Hat and DefCon held in Las Vegas in an effort to recruit hackers to secure cyberspace.\n  Holograms. Smarthomes. Self-parking cars. Drones. Cryptocurrency. Metadata. Virtual weapons. An Internet kill switch? I stepped out of my time machine into a world I no longer feel connected to.\n  For me, I stepped out into an uncertain future. I don\u2019t really see meaningful human interaction anymore. I see a society that is impossibly distracted by likes and selfies, smartphones, and similar technologies, and I often find it frustrating to find my place in the midst of this new interconnected world simply because I was not there to naturally evolve with it.\n I was somewhere outside of time, on the other side of the looking glass. Waiting. Counting fractions of what felt like forever, for when I would be released back into society again. Only to discover a world I do not know.\n   Follow us on\u00a0  Twitter \u00a0and\u00a0  Facebook \u00a0and join our\u00a0  Telegram channel \u00a0to know what\u2019s up with crypto and why it\u2019s

"note_en": "Today at  CppCon 2019, we (the  MSVC team) announced that we\u2019re releasing our implementation of the C++ Standard Library (also known as the STL) as open source.\n https://github.com/microsoft/STL is our new repository, containing all of our product source code, a new CMake build system, and a README with more information. As it explains, we\u2019re still working on migrating to GitHub. While you can clone and build the code right now, there are several things we need to do (like adding our test suites) before we can begin reviewing pull requests.\n   A: There are several reasons. Working on the STL in GitHub will allow our customers to follow our development as it happens, try out our latest changes, and help improve our pull requests by reviewing them. As C++ Standardization accelerates, with more large features being voted in every year, we believe that accepting major features as open source contributions will be important. (For example, C++20\u2019s chrono and format libraries are potential candidates.) We also want to contribute back to the C++ community by making it possible to take our implementations of major features. (For example, C++17\u2019s charconv.)\n Q: What license are you using, and does this directly affect Visual Studio\u2019s customers?\n A: MSVC\u2019s STL is distributed under the  Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions, which was recently created by the Clang/LLVM/libc++ project. We chose this permissive open source license because having the same license as  libc++ will make it easier to share code between our libraries. To be clear, MSVC\u2019s STL isn\u2019t merging with libc++; they\u2019re still distinct libraries that support different platforms with different data structure representations. However, if libc++\u2019s maintainers are interested in taking feature implementations from MSVC\u2019s STL (e.g. floating-point charconv), or in collaborating on the development of new features in both libraries simultaneously, we\u2019ll be able to help without having to worry about licensing.\n As a customer of MSVC\u2019s STL, you might be wondering whether this new license creates new obligations for you. Microsoft\u2019s position is that the text of the Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions (specifically, the wording of the LLVM Exceptions) clearly states that when you compile your own source code using MSVC\u2019s STL to produce object code or similar output (e.g. static libraries, dynamic libraries, and executables), you aren\u2019t required to provide attribution when shipping your compiled products to your end users. This is another reason we\u2019ve chosen this license: to avoid disrupting our customers\u2019 businesses.\n (Additional note, in the interest of completeness: MSVC\u2019s STL contains source code derived from  Boost.Math and  Ryu, used under the terms of the Boost Software License v1.0. This is another permissive open source license that also contains an explicit exception for object code. Our derived source code is distributed under the Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions.)\n  A: We have no such plans. We chose the STL because it\u2019s different from other MSVC libraries and the compiler. Specifically, the STL is fast-evolving and designed by the C++ Standardization Committee, unlike other MSVC libraries. (Being designed by Committee is an advantage for open sourcing! It means that we don\u2019t need to spend any time and energy on feature design review. Implementation strategy and tactics are far more constrained, and therefore easier to review.) The STL is also relatively easy to contribute to, and somewhat loosely coupled, unlike the compiler (where, as a general rule, everything interacts with everything else).\n (One exception: there are support libraries for the STL that we may open source in the future, but we have nothing to announce at this time.)\n  A: A fairly small one: we\u2019re going to spend some time overhauling our build system, test infrastructure, and issue tracking, which will delay some work on C++20 library features. (We just finished implementing all C++17 library features, so this shouldn\u2019t be too problematic.) This will allow us to work on the STL more efficiently and ultimately reach C++20 completeness faster.\n  The MSVC team would like to thank  Dinkumware and P.J.

"note_en": "Michael Schwartz: Hello and welcome to Open Source Underdogs. I\u2019m your host Mike Schwartz, and this is episode 48 with Ev Kontsevoy, CEO of Gravitational. This episode, it\u2019s a little longer than most, clocking in closer to 45 minutes. That\u2019s definitely because Ev has such a broad breadth of technical and business experience, we probably could have gone on another hour. If you want to hear a little bit more about the tech stack, watch The FLOSS Weekly, episode 529. I\u2019ll put in a link on the episode website. Gravitational has two very interesting products, and they are somewhat related but also a little different. It must have been a tough marketing challenge to come up with a unified message, but apparently they did it, because the company\u2019s been super successful by all measures.\n So, without further ado,let\u2019s cut to the tape. And after you listened to this podcast, I\u2019m sure you\u2019llwant to check out Gravitational\u2019s website for more info.\n    Michael Schwartz: Before we talk about Gravitational,can you talk a little bit about your previous startup called Mailgun and yourexperience at Rackspace, and how that led you to identify the businessopportunity for a Gravitational?\n Ev Kontsevoy: Mailgun was interesting, and for those who don\u2019t know, Mailgun is an API platform to send and receive emails programmatically, so it\u2019s email for developers. If you need to send a password recovery email, or if you need to send newsletters to your customers, you just use Mailgun API to send those messages and collect responses.\n That company was interesting to me because of two things. First, it was founded in the middle of financial collapse. I moved to New York City around 2009, right when the economy was self-collapsing, I guess. And it\u2019s also when AWS was beginning to happen, which is always interesting, like, which means that when everything is crushing around you, there is always some positives. And I thought, well, if Jeff Bezos can sell APIs to servers, I could probably sell APIs to emails.\n And the reason for that is that if you\u2019re moving to the cloud, you cannot really take your things with you, so whatever email delivery appliance you used to have, like you need to have a virtual replacement for it, that\u2019s how Mailgun really got started. It was really tough, raising money back then for a project like this, because most investors didn\u2019t understand what an API was. I would do a presentation, and then an investor will pull out a Blackberry. And he said, \u201cAll right. So, I got my Blackberry here out, so how do I use you API?\u201d At that moment, you know that you lost, that this is not going anywhere.\n But then, an interestingthing happened. A Twilio got funded. And everyone paid attention because Twiliosaid, \u201cOh, we are API for developers to do, like, SMS.\u201d They started sayingthat Mailgun is simply a Twilio, like Twilio, but for email. And it helpedtremendously.\n So, we got accepted into Y Combinator, in 2011 actually, and went from there. I ran the company for a couple of years and eventually got acquired by Rackspace, by one of the cloud providers.  So, the interesting thing I learned from that experience \u2013 well, it was my first company, so you\u2019ll obviously learn a ton if you do that \u2013 but as a technologist, I wasn\u2019t prepared to be exposed to so much\u2026let\u2019s just say crime. That\u2019s what it is really. Because email is a really dark world, so many shady things happen via email. You know, fishing, and viruses, and spam, and I would say that 80% of my attention was consumed by those problems, as we were running that company, which is unfortunate, because you actually want your real users, engineers, developers to enjoy, the product, you want their experience to be great, you want performance to be great, you want documentation to be amazing. And you constantly have to deal with spammers, fishers, and all parts of bad, bad internet.\n So, that was my Mailgun experience. And the reason we, I guess, decided to sell that company to Rackspace, is because Rackspace at the time had very compelling vision, for using open source and open standards to free the world from AWS dominance.That was kind of resonating with me because I started my career as a software developer during Windows dominance. And I just remember how boring and bleak everything felt, just operating within constraints of what Microsoft thinks you should be doing. And, yeah, so that was the story of Mailgun.\n    Michael Schwartz: I was listening to another episode, or another interview with you, and you spoke for some time about some of the interesting technical challenges around how complex Mailgun was, and how you were considering replicating it on a different cloud, and how completely, like just, it seemed like such a big challenge. And I was wondering if that sort of gave you some technical ideas that might have led to the development of the Gravitational, like, technology stack?\n Ev Kontsevoy: Oh, so, that\u2019s more interesting question \u2013 how did I go from being an email person to effectively ending up almost in the security space. So, what do you think happens right after an acquisition, when one technical company acquires another technical company? It happened with us, and maybe, like, when Facebook acquired Instagram, there was probably something similar there, the first thing they ask you to do is, start planning to migrate all your stuff into their own infrastructure.\n Especially for Rackspace. Rackspace\u2019s a cloud provider. It would be really strange for them to have an email service that\u2019s not using their own cloud. And at the time, we were using SoftLayer, which is now part of IBM \u2013 old-school, bare-metal servers, and migrating to a public cloud on Rackspace, which was virtualized and had all these fancy infrastructures as code capabilities. It took us a long time, I don\u2019t remember exactly how long it took, but let\u2019s just say if I say 6 months, it\u2019s not going to be an exaggeration.\n And I remember having a conversation with someone in my family, maybe it was even my wife, where someone asked me like, \u201cSo, what are you doing \u2013 like, now, post-acquisition \u2013 like what are you building?\u201d And I said, \u201cWe\u2019re not building anything, we\u2019re just moving from SoftLayer data center to Rackspace data center.\u201d And that person wasn\u2019t technical, and she said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that, like, copying files over the internet??\u201d \u201cWhy is it taking six months?\u201d Like, \u201cYou have that many files??\u201d\n And I laughed. But at the same time, it was kind of illuminating. Like, normal people think that copying software from one data center to another, it\u2019s something that happens within few seconds.  Wouldn\u2019t you probably feel the same, like, what is software, is it just some files, you have software on your laptop, I have software on my laptop, like, it\u2019s just copying things around, but apparently, when it comes to data center software, to what we call cloud software today, everything takes months.\n And, at the time, I just kind of took this for granted, like you\u2019re sure it\u2019s a complex problem.  We have completely different security here, we\u2019re going to have that over there, over here we are using this kind of load balancing, over there is going to be different kind of load balancing, and the code needs to be updated, and so on and so forth.\n But then, when I became a \u201cracker\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s how Rackspace employees called themselves, I was a proud Racker by the way, I love that culture \u2013 so, once I became a racker, I got exposed to vast representation of cloud users out there, companies who use cloud computing. And I was talking to them usually trying to understand how can we improve, how we can make our cloud offering better.\n And I was amazed how frequently they will bring this problem that I had with Mailgun. It\u2019s like, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve built this application, and it\u2019s running on AWS, and now we\u2019re trying to run it on Rackspace, and it\u2019s really challenging. Can you help us?\u201d\n Or they would say, \u201cWe want to use Rackspace, or AWS, or Azure, some kind of cloud provider to build applications, the development environment, but for whatever reason, we need to actually run it in Luxembourg, like in the data center that is supposedly compliant with whatever regulations there are under.\n So, how do we have staging environment in one place and identical production in a completely different place? And they kept coming to us looking for advice. And sometimes, we would be able to sell them something, you know, like DevOps as a service, or security as a service. But generally, I just saw this trend is that people feel like they\u2019re chained to their cloud environment.  It doesn\u2019t even matter how amazing that environment is.\n But not being able to just take your production and have like, I don\u2019t know, a hundred copies of it running all over the world \u2013 it\u2019s extremely frustrating. And it\u2019s limiting to a lot of use cases. You know, latency is important. Because the laws of physics, they don\u2019t really change. So, you have to be able to run your code, close to where your data sets are. Data sets are distributed, which means that code needs to be distributed.\n And that\u2019s what I became deeply dissatisfied with SaaS model, in general. I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with Software-as-a-Service, but there is definitely something wrong with software-as-a-service running in a single place.\n And as I was talking to more and more companies, I realized that some of them \u2013 check this out \u2013 they can\u2019t even recreate their production environment in a different Amazon account. Those are companies based in Silicon Valley by the way.\n So, let me just kind ofzoom into this use case: you have an application running in an AWS account thatyou have \u2013 you control that. Go ahead and create another AWS account fromscratch, also yours, so you have full, you know, God permissions for bothaccounts. And then, have a full replica of what you have in one account andanother. And a surprising amount of companies don\u2019t know how to do that.\n They just overtime kindof lose institutional knowledge of what would it take to recreate everythingfrom scratch. And as an engineer, you probably understand why that ishappening, because you know, when you start building your application, like in theearly days, not a single line of code is written, but you\u2019d know that you needsome environment.\n You\u2019re going to go andclick some buttons in that AWS panel, maybe you\u2019ll write some terraform, orcloud formation, but not always, maybe use Ansible, so, you kind of startmanually creating first layer of your future environment. Then you start addingthings on top, then you start deploying your code, maybe manually at first,maybe SCP. And then, you move to something, I don\u2019t know, maybe like Ansible,or Chef, or Puppet.\n So, things happen over time, and not everything is documented. Some scripts, they run daily, maybe they are part of your CICD pipeline. Other scripts you ran three years ago, and maybe the person who did it is no longer with the company. So, the point is, almost any cloud environment today, it\u2019s built with many layers that are created over time by different people.\n And that\u2019s the reason why they\u2019re not reproducible. And a company needs to have, you know, we need to have seven regions all over the world instead of one. Or we need to run our software inside of someone else\u2019s AWS account. Or we need to deploy into GovCloud because government wants to use our software. They run into all these issues that they\u2019re chained to one specific environment. And that\u2019s why Gravitational was born. That\u2019s the company that a bunch of ex Mailgunners started. So, that\u2019s maybe a different answer to your original question.\n  Michael Schwartz:\u00a0So, let me drill down a little bit more, Gravitational hastwo products, Teleport and Gravity. Which was the first product? Or were theyboth coming at the same time?\n Ev Kontsevoy: It\u2019s basically a packaging question. We initially built a solution, so if you want to run your software in many different places, you have to solve many different issues for that. You need to separate your application dependencies from infrastructure. You need to solve remote access problem, you need to solve compliance problem \u2013 because a lot of these companies, like the reason they needed to be in the different place is because of compliance requirements.\n And we had \u2013 what I would just call a code base,a bunch of GitHub repositories. We have this culture internally that we createGitHub repository per library. So, we break everything we built into theselibraries. Each library has its own repository, and then we compile thesoftware, and then, we produce solution.\n So, originally, everything we built was just a collection of these repositories. And we started to sell the solution called Gravity, and Gravity includes everything we do. Gravity is a complete platform. With Gravity, you can take your AWS account \u2013 technically, it\u2019s a Kubernetes cluster, but let\u2019s put that aside for now \u2013 and you could save it all into a single file. That\u2019s your image, we call it \u201ccluster image\u201d.\n Think about like doing a snapshot \u2013 it\u2019s not a snapshot, but I think it\u2019s a helpful analogy \u2013 and then you can move that file somewhere else, and you can create exact replica. So, you take this image that contains the full copy of your production environment, and you can copy/paste it all over the world, and you can have thousands of identical environments created from that image.\n So, the question then becomes, how do you keep them up-to-date, how do you push software updates, how do you fix the vulnerabilities, how do you troubleshoot problems that happen remotely. So, you do need to have some kind of remote access to those environments. Interesting analogy that I like is software updates built into operating systems.\n If you have a Mac, it somehow updates itself, it downloads things from Apple, it applies these updates at reboots, and all of this kind of is just working automatically. So, think about it, from Apple\u2019s perspective, how is that different from running a massive software deployment to hundreds of millions of servers running on untrusted network all over the world, with unreliable internet connectivity. For a typical data center person, that is a Star Wars level tech. And that is what Gravity tries to do with data centers, with your cloud account.\n And this component that allows you to securely download and apply updates, that is what Teleport is. It is basically a part of Gravity that enables this world-class security into this restricted, regulated, remote environments, where Gravity is usually running.   And at some point, we thought, why don\u2019t we make open source available for people to use as their own software update mechanism in their own kind of applications. And we open-source that, we put documentation in a separate place. And what we discovered very quickly is that people realize that it\u2019s a much better way to do SSH than open SSH oftentimes is. Which was completely unintentional, but it was kind of nice for us because suddenly people started to discover Teleport, and download, and use it more. And basically, it\u2019s a really good way to access infrastructure right now.\n So, whatever you\u2019re using to SSH into your servers, or to access your Kubernetes cluster, you\u2019re probably using something worse, so I highly encourage everyone to check Teleport out. It\u2019s free, open-source, Apache license. So, that\u2019s how it happened \u2013 everything was built at the same time, but Teleport, just by accident, developed its own fan base, so to speak.\n   Ev Kontsevoy: It\u2019s hard to say. I think both of them are doing really well, and Teleport is definitely not as expensive as Gravity is because it\u2019s not as foundational to company\u2019s business. Because we have Gravity customers who basically run massive, they sell a lot of software into these remote locations and deliver it with Gravity. So, Teleport, it\u2019s usually part of a platform, it\u2019s not the whole platform. So, it\u2019s cheaper per deal, but we do close a lot more Teleport deals.\n  Michael Schwartz:\u00a0Have there been some challenges around finding the right marketing message for this platform?    Ev Kontsevoy: Absolutely, absolutely. I do think we\u2019re still searching for the right way to describe what we do to the world. There are people out there who believe that Gravitational is a company that helps you take your SaaS application and sell it as a kind of on-premise environment. And it\u2019s fine. Yes, we can do that, and we can do it better than anyone else.\n But to me, that\u2019s not really the reason why I decided to spend significant, you know, invest a portion of my life into this company. We want to enable a completely different software distribution model. Think about it like push versus pull.\n We believe that the reliance of DevOps team needs to be reduced. The fact that most companies today have to set up and maintain these complex environments, with so many moving parts, and have these massive DevOps teams that constantly struggle with this ever-increasing complexity of this environment \u2013 it just feels temporary to me. It\u2019s got to be simpler.\n The typical DevOps picture at a company, like average company today, reminds me of what you would read in a history book about early computing.\n Remember those stories about old electromechanical computers that would take up the whole room in the building, and you had cockroaches and bugs crawling in, and you had special people called debuggers kicking them out with broomsticks and replacing vacuum tubes and relays, computing was like a manual job, you had to have people walk around and constantly do that.\n That reminds me a little bit about like a typical cloud environment today. I think it should be sealed, fully automated with zero human presence. So, if you walk into a data center today, you\u2019re actually not going to see that many people, probably you\u2019re not going to see anybody at all. There\u2019s going to be some security at the entrance, but inside, it\u2019s going to be quiet, no people.\n So, I want that to be true for virtual access as well. Even though there are no physical people in that data center, but you could be assured that there are probably hundreds, if not thousands of DevOps engineers, maintaining those machines basically manually. And the purpose of like the goal for Gravitational is to make it not so. We want this all to be completely automated, similar to how millions of Apple laptops download software from Apple, apply patches, and keep running. I see no reason why a typical cloud environment for a typical company should be very different from a MacBook.\n  Michael Schwartz:\u00a0How do you convert that into like business peak? You know,because it\u2019s sort of, like, what you\u2019re saying is almost like a kind of \u201csale tothe guy with the hands on the keyboard\u201d. Is there a way to convert that intolike actual value proposition for the business customers?\n Ev Kontsevoy: Well, first of all, let\u2019s be honest with ourselves \u2013 can we do this today? Let\u2019s just take a random company that have nothing to do with, let\u2019s say \u2013\n  Ev Kontsevoy: \u00a0eBay. Can they make all ofeBay run similar to a MacBook, with no DevOps team or server today? No, Ican\u2019t. There\u2019s so many problems. Like, it\u2019s a complex challenge. So, it\u2019s goingto take us many years to actually solve all of these challenges. But what youcan do, you can start looking into where DevOps teams are overloaded today andstart pushing that needle.\n So, for example, if you try to run the same application, let\u2019s say in a hundred different places, you will quickly realize that secure access is a huge problem. Because all these different cloud environments, they have their own tools for accessing infrastructure. And then, you have this like open-source ecosystem that all these components need to be integrated and everything used to be secure. And it begins with SSH, and it ends with Kubernetes access, and then you have, like, internal things, like Jenkins, maybe how do you secure access to Jenkins \u2013\n......", "posttime": "2020-06-10

"note_en": "On the surface QCAD and LibreCAD and every other 2D CAD software is the same, offering the same basic tools, user interface, and supported file formats. The small differences will either have you praising the software developers or cursing them as you spend your precious time fiddling with the quirks.\n In 2011 LibreCAD was forked from QCAD version 2. In the software development community, forking is the process of duplicating a project and having it be developed by a different group of engineers. The process is common when developers have differencing opinions on where the project is headed or want to implement features that the original project owners don\u2019t want. At that time, QCAD and LibreCAD were nearly identical since they were copies of each other.\n In 2012, QCAD diverted greatly from their previous version which LibreCAD was based and reworked large portions of their software to bring it up to version 3. With version 3, QCAD implemented many improvements to their software that now distinctly distances it from LibreCAD.\n  The feature list is infinitely larger, but you likely already know that both programs have tools for lines, arcs, dimensions, ellipses, snapping, hatching, and modification and movement tools.\n  Outside of the expected tools for 2D CAD programs, almost every additional feature present in QCAD is unique compared to LibreCAD. A full list of  QCAD features is available on their website.\n Some features are limited to QCAD Professional, those will be left out of the below features to compare QCAD and LibreCAD on a level ground.\n QCAD text tools has many additional features. You can stylize text with their rich text editor to add color, set font weight, add italics, and more. Maybe the best part of it is that once the text is placed in the drawing, you can edit it.\n QCAD comes with a library of over 5,000 parts (screws, nuts, symbols, \u2026) to use in your drawings. The library browser also lets you set favorites and has text search.\n A fantastic addition to QCAD is ECMA scripting. With ECMA scripting, plugins can be written in a high level programming language to automate drawing parts and create new tools. Even if you don\u2019t program, this feature lets other developers easily create tools that you can use.\n Aside from 2D and isometric projection with LibreCAD also supports, QCAD supports planometric, dimetric, cabinet, and cavalier projections. I\u2019ve never needed anything other than isometric view, but for more experienced designers, this feature alone could change your perspective on what program to use.\n QCAD also has a dark theme for their program. You can switch from light to dark to save your eyes when working at night. These small differences really add up when you spend hours inside a single program.\n  LibreCAD has no defining features compared to QCAD in their current states. \u201cLibreCAD is going to get new features, QCad will not.\u201d, R. van Twisk said when asked about the differences between QCAD and LibreCAD  [1]. At the time, QCAD did appear to be unmaintained, but QCAD was working quietly on their next large release.\n R. van Twisk, a contributor to LibreCAD also said, \u201cLibreCAD is truly open source while QCad was not,\u201d which may have been the case in the past, but QCAD is on GitHub and accepts pull requests from other developers.\n  I suggest using QCAD over LibreCAD in every case. With the additional features, more polished drawing interface, and the always expanding feature set, QCAD is a solid choice over LibreCAD. I\u2019ve made the switch from LibreCAD to QCAD a few months ago and have really enjoyed how the program runs.\n Everything in QCAD works as I expect without having to fiddle with settings or lookup why certain tools behave the way they do. Even without the additional features, QCAD makes for a much nicer environment to work in.", "posttime": "2020-06-10 18:43:18", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

"note_en": "I love tinkering my shell environment. I found myself sitting down during the weekend and doing an overhaul of my configuration approach for ZSH. That said, I decided to change my ZSH plugin management and started using  Antigen.\n Antigen is a small set of helper functions that allow you to frictionless management of ZSH plugins. Personally, I was addicted to vim for decades and used vundle to manage my vim customizations. As the official Antigen website mentions: \u201c Antigen is to ZSH what Vundle is to vim.\u201d\n  This small post guides you through the setup process and demonstrates how to manage plugins and themes with Antigen to tailor your ZSH experience.\n  Installing Antigen on your system is just a one-liner. All necessary helper functions are part of a single file that you have to download on your machine. I use  curl to do so:\n   Before we dive into changing the  .zshrc, let\u2019s do a backup of the current configuration.\n     If you are starting using a fresh  .zshrc you may end up with something like this\n # 1. Source Antigen source /path-to-antigen/antigen.zsh # 2. Use Antigen to load stuff ## Use oh-my-zshantigen use oh-my-zsh ## Use some pluginsantigen bundle gitantigen bundle dockerantigen bundle kubernetes ## Load a custom Themeantigen theme cloud # 3. Commit Antigen Configurationantigen apply\n  Although Antigen works out of the box pretty well, you can tailor Antigen\u2019s behavior a little bit by using certain environment variables. We won\u2019t go through all the configuration properties here. Instead, I just want to point you to those properties that were most interesting to myself:\n Set the default Git repository URL for antigen bundle function calls. Defaults to oh-my-zsh repository\n   I already mentioned that Antigen is just a set of helper functions. However, it makes sense to look into a couple of those commands in more detail to understand what is going on and what is possible. Look at the  commands page of the documentation to get the entire list of available commands.\n  With  antigen use you load and configure any kind of pre-packaged ZSH-framework like for example the awesome  oh-my-zsh. You should call  antigen use before loading further plugins.\n  Besides oh-my-zsh you can also use  prezto or any other custom library, by providing its Git repository.\n   antigen bundle is perhaps the function that you will use most often. It comes with some great conventions that will boost your productivity. By default,  antigen bundle loads plugins into your terminal from the official oh-my-zsh Git repository. Having this context, we can address several plugins just by its name.\n  If you have set a different default repository ( ANTIGEN_DEFAULT_REPO_URL), you can still consume plugins from oh-my-zsh by adding the repository as a qualifier:\n  In this case, we specify the Git repository ( robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). The desired plugin is located at  plugins/git within the repository. You can verify by navigating the repository on GitHub.\n There are  some additional arguments that you can provide when calling  antigen bundle like  --branch. However, I was fine with being able to consume plugins from oh-my-zsh and by addressing the explicitly using  gituser:repo path/to/plugin.\n  With  antigen theme, you can load and activate the desired theme for your shell instance. The syntax is similar to  antigen bundle and allows to consume themes by name from the default repository:\n  Alternatively, you can load themes from other sources like Git repositories or Gists by specifying the entire URL\n  Many themes in oh-my-zsh rely on custom functions provided by oh-my-zsh itself. Because of this, you should call  antigen theme after  antigen use.\n  I found myself using  antigen list a couple of times within the shell instance to verify and validate Antigen loads all the desired plugins. You can also append  --long and get more detailed information directly in the shell. This makes it easy to spot misconfiguration and get an overview of what is loaded in your shell instance.\n antigen list  --longhttps://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git lib plugin  truehttps://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git plugins/git plugin  truehttps://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git plugins/docker plugin  truehttps://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git plugins/kubectl plugin  truehttps://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git plugins/themes plugin  truehttps://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git themes/cloud.zsh-theme theme  true\n  As you can see, Antigen simplifies and unifies the process of consuming both plugins and themes from different sources.

"note_en": "Have you ever had to draw an architecture diagram and found the repetitive clicking and dragging tedious? Did you have to do modifications to that diagram and found it complicated?\n Graphviz is an open source graph visualization software that allows us to decribe a diagram using code, and have it automatically drawn for us. If the diagram needs to be modified in the future, we just need to modify the description and the nodes and edges will be repositioned automatically for us.\n  Before we start writing graphs, we need to learn how we can convert our code into an image so we can test what we are doing.\n    This will install, among other things, the  dot CLI, which can be used to generate images from text files:\n  In the example above we are specifying png as the output ( -Tpng), but there are many  options available. As we can see, the input files commonly use the  gv extension.\n  DOT is the most common format used to describe graphs to be parsed by Graphviz.\n     If we want to use a directed graph (one with arrows), we need to use  digraph instead:\n        digraph  MyGraph  {  a  [ shape = box ]  b  [ shape = polygon , sides = 6 ]  c  [ shape = triangle ]  d  [ shape = invtriangle ]  e  [ shape = polygon , sides = 4 , skew = . 5 ]  f  [ shape = polygon , sides = 4 , distortion = . 5 ]  g  [ shape = diamond ]  h  [ shape = Mdiamond ]  i  [ shape = Msquare ]  a  -&gt;  b  a  -&gt;  c  a  -&gt;  d  a  -&gt;  e  a  -&gt;  f  a  -&gt;  g  a  -&gt;  h  a  -&gt;  i }\n  The different supported shapes can be found in the  node shapes section of their documentation.\n  digraph  MyGraph  {  a  [ style = filled , color = green ]  b  [ peripheries = 4 , color = blue ]  c  [ fontcolor = crimson ]  d  [ style = filled , fillcolor = dodgerblue , color = coral4 , penwidth = 3 ]  e  [ style = dotted ]  f  [ style = dashed ]  g  [ style = diagonals ]  h  [ style = filled , color = &#34; #333399 &#34; ]  i  [ style = filled , color = &#34; #ff000055 &#34; ]  j  [ shape = box , style = striped , fillcolor = &#34; red:green:blue &#34; ]  k  [ style = wedged , fillcolor = &#34; green:white:red &#34; ]  a  -&gt;  b  a  -&gt;  c  a  -&gt;  d  a  -&gt;  e  b  -&gt;  f  b  -&gt;  g  b  -&gt;  h  b  -&gt;  i  d  -&gt;  j  j  -&gt;  k }\n     digraph  MyGraph  {  a  -&gt;  b  [ dir = both , arrowhead = open , arrowtail = inv ]  a  -&gt;  c  [ dir = both , arrowhead = dot , arrowtail = invdot ]  a  -&gt;  d  [ dir = both , arrowhead = odot , arrowtail = invodot ]  a  -&gt;  e  [ dir = both , arrowhead = tee , arrowtail = empty ]  a  -&gt;  f  [ dir = both , arrowhead = halfopen , arrowtail = crow ]  a  -&gt;  g  [ dir = both , arrowhead = diamond , arrowtail = box ] }\n    digraph  MyGraph  {  a  -&gt;  b  [ color = &#34; black:red:blue &#34; ]  a  -&gt;  c  [ color = &#34; black:red;0.5:blue &#34; ]  a  -&gt;  d  [ dir = none , color = &#34; green:red:blue &#34; ]  a  -&gt;  e  [ dir = none , color = &#34; green:red;.3:blue &#34; ]  a  -&gt;  f  [ dir = none , color = &#34; orange &#34; ]  d  -&gt;  g  [ arrowsize = 2.5 ]  d  -&gt;  h  [ style = dashed ]  d  -&gt;  i  [ style = dotted ]  d  -&gt;  j  [ penwidth = 5 ] }\n  If we pay attention to the code and diagram above, we can see that when we specify multiple colors for an arrow, there will be one line for each color, if we don\u2019t specify any weight. If we want a single arrow with multiple colors, at least one color has to specify the weight percentage of the line to cover:\n    digraph  MyGraph  {  begin  [ label = &#34; This is the beginning &#34; ]  end  [ label = &#34; It ends here &#34; ]  begin  -&gt;  end }\n      digraph  MyGraph  {  begin  [ label = &#34; This is the beginning &#34; , fontcolor = green , fontsize = 10 ]  end  [ label = &#34; It ends here &#34; , fontcolor = red , fontsize = 10 ]  begin  -&gt;  end  [ label = &#34; Beginning to end &#34; , fontcolor = gray , fontsize = 16 ] }\n   Clusters are also called subgraphs. The name of a cluster needs to be start with  cluster_, or it won\u2019t be contained in a box.\n digraph  MyGraph  {  subgraph  cluster_a  {  b  c  -&gt;  d  }  a  -&gt;  b  d  -&gt;  e }\n   digraph  MyGraph  {  subgraph  cluster_a  {  subgraph  cluster_b  {  subgraph  cluster_c  {  d  }  c  -&gt;  d  }  b  -&gt;  c  }  a  -&gt;  b  d  -&gt;  e }\n   HTML allows us to create more complicated nodes that can be split into sections. Each section can be referred to in the graph independently:\n digraph  MyGraph  {  a  [ shape = plaintext , label =&lt;  &lt; table &gt;  &lt; tr &gt;  &lt; td &gt; Hello &lt; /td &gt;  &lt; td &gt; world !&lt; /td &gt;  &lt; /tr &gt;  &lt; tr &gt;  &lt; td  colspan = &#34; 2 &#34;  port = &#34; a1 &#34; &gt; are  you  ok ? &lt; /td &gt;  &lt; /tr &gt;  &lt; /table &gt;  &gt; ]  b  [ shape = plaintext , label =&lt;  &lt; table  border = &#34; 0 &#34;  cellborder = &#34; 1 &#34;  cellspacing = &#34; 0 &#34; &gt;  &lt; tr &gt;  &lt; td  rowspan = &#34; 3 &#34; &gt; left &lt; /td &gt;  &lt; td &gt; top &lt; /td &gt;  &lt; td  rowspan = &#34; 3 &#34;  port = &#34; b2 &#34; &gt; right &lt; /td &gt;  &lt; /tr &gt;  &lt; tr &gt;  &lt; td  port = &#34; b1 &#34; &gt; center &lt; /td &gt;  &lt; /tr &gt;  &lt; tr &gt;  &lt; td &gt; bottom &lt; /td &gt;  &lt; /tr &gt;  &lt; /table &gt;  &gt; ]  a : a1  -&gt;  b : b1  a : a1  -&gt;  b : b2 }\n  Only a subset of HTML can be used to create nodes, and the rules are pretty strict. In order for the node to display correctly, we need to set the  shape to  plaintext.\n Another important thing to notice is the  port attribute, which allows us to reference that specific cell by using a colon ( a:a1).\n We can style our HTML nodes, but we can only use a subset of HTML:\n digraph  MyGraph  {  a  [ shape = plaintext , label =&lt;  &lt; table &gt;  &lt; tr &gt;  &lt; td  color = &#34; #ff0000 &#34;  bgcolor = &#34; #008822 &#34; &gt;&lt; font  color = &#34; #55ff00 &#34; &gt; Hello &lt; /font&gt;&lt;/ td &gt;  &lt; td &gt; world !&lt; /td &gt;  &lt; /tr &gt;  &lt; tr &gt;  &lt; td  colspan = &#34; 2 &#34;  color = &#34; #00ff00 &#34;  bgcolor = &#34; #ff0000 &#34; &gt;  &lt; font  color = &#34; #ffffff &#34; &gt; are  you  ok ? &lt; /font &gt;  &lt; /td &gt;  &lt; /tr &gt;  &lt; /table &gt;  &gt; ] }\n   Sometimes we want to use specify icons for our nodes, this can be done with the  image attribute:\n digraph  MyGraph  {  ec2  [ shape = none , label = &#34;&#34; , image = &#34; icons/ec2.png &#34; ]  igw  [ shape = none , label = &#34;&#34; , image = &#34; icons/igw.png &#34; ]  rds  [ shape = none , label = &#34;&#34; , image = &#34; icons/rds.png &#34; ]  vpc  [ shape = none , label = &#34;&#34; , image = &#34; icons/vpc.png &#34; ]  subgraph  cluster_vpc  {  label = &#34; VPC &#34;  subgraph  cluster_public_subnet  {  label = &#34; Public Subnet &#34;  ec2  }  subgraph  cluster_private_subnet  {  label = &#34; Private Subnet &#34;  ec2  -&gt;  rds  }  vpc  igw  -&gt;  ec2  }  users  -&gt;  igw }\n   Ranks are one of the most complicated things to understand, since they alter how the rendering engine works. Here I\u2019m just going to cover some of the basic things that I find useful.\n  digraph  MyGraph  {  a  -&gt;  b  b  -&gt;  c  a  -&gt;  d  a  -&gt;  c }\n   digraph  MyGraph  {  rankdir = LR  a  -&gt;  b  b  -&gt;  c  a  -&gt;  d  a  -&gt;  c }\n  Ranking can also be used to force a node to be at the same level as another node:\n digraph  MyGraph  {  rankdir = LR  a  -&gt;  b  b  -&gt;  c  a  -&gt;  d  a  -&gt;  c  { rank = same ; c ; b } }\n   The  rankdir attribute is global, so it can\u2019t be changed inside a cluster, but using  rank we can simulate an  LR direction inside clusters:\n digraph  MyGraph  {  subgraph  cluster_A  {  a1  -&gt;  a2  a2  -&gt;  a3  { rank = same ; a1 ; a2 ; a3 }  }  subgraph  cluster_B  {  a3  -&gt;  b1  b1  -&gt;  b2  b2  -&gt;  b3  { rank = same ; b1 ; b2 ; b3 }  }  begin  -&gt;  a1 }\n   digraph  MyGraph  {  subgraph  cluster_A  {  a1  a2  a3  { rank = same ; a1 ; a2 ; a3 }  }  subgraph  cluster_B  {  b1  b2  b3  { rank = same ; b1 ; b2 ; b3 }  }  begin  -&gt;  a1  a1  -&gt;  a2  [ constraint = false ]  a2  -&gt;  a3  [ constraint = false ]  a3  -&gt;  b1  b1  -&gt;  b2  b2  -&gt;  b3 }\n       In this post we learned how we can use Graphviz to generate graphs based on a declarative language. This has made it a lot easier for me to draw architecture diagrams and modify them in the future.\n I presented the features that I consider most important for everyday use, but there are a good amount of features that I didn\u2019t cover and frankly, I don\u2019t understand.\n  [    open_source\u00a0 ]", "posttime": "2020-06-10 17:52:43", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  A  whistler is a  very low frequency or VLF  electromagnetic (radio) wave generated by  lightning.  [1] Frequencies of terrestrial whistlers are 1\u00a0 kHz to 30\u00a0kHz, with a maximum amplitude usually at 3\u00a0kHz to 5\u00a0kHz. Although they are electromagnetic waves, they occur at  audio frequencies, and can be converted to audio using a suitable receiver. They are produced by lightning strikes (mostly intracloud and return-path) where the impulse travels along the Earth&#39;s magnetic field lines from one hemisphere to the other. They undergo  dispersion of several kHz due to the slower velocity of the lower frequencies through the  plasma environments of the  ionosphere and  magnetosphere. Thus they are perceived as a descending tone which can last for a few seconds. The study of whistlers categorizes them into Pure Note, Diffuse, 2-Hop, and Echo Train types.\n Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft detected whistler-like activity in the vicinity of  Jupiter known as &#34;Jovian Whistlers&#34;, implying the presence of lightning there.\n   The pulse of electromagnetic energy of a lightning discharge producing whistlers contains a wide range of frequencies below the electron cyclotron frequency. Due to interactions with free electrons in the ionosphere, the waves becomes highly dispersive and like guided waves, follow the lines of geomagnetic field. These lines provide the field with sufficient focusing influence and prevents the scattering of field energy. Their paths reach into the outer space as far as 3 to 4 times the Earth&#39;s radius in the plane of equator and bring energy from lightning discharge to the Earth at a point in the opposite hemisphere which is the magnetic conjugate of the position of radio emission for whistlers. From there, the whistler waves are reflected back to the hemisphere from which they started. The energy is almost perfectly reflected from earth surface 4 or 5 times with increase dispersion and diminishing amplitude. Along such long paths the speed of propagation of energy is between c/10 to c/100 and the exact value depends upon frequency.\n  Whistlers were probably heard as early as 1886 on long telephone lines, but the clearest early description was by Barkhausen in 1919. In 1953, Storey showed that whistlers originate from lightning discharges.  [1]\n  A type of electromagnetic signal propagating in the  Earth\u2013ionosphere waveguide, known as a  radio atmospheric signal or sferic, may escape the ionosphere and propagate outward into the magnetosphere. The signal is prone to bounce-mode propagation, reflecting back and forth on opposite sides of the planet until totally attenuated. To clarify which part of this hop pattern the signal is in, it is specified by a number, indicating the portion of the bounce path it is currently on.  [2] On its first upward path, it is known as a  0 +. After passing the  geomagnetic equator, it is referred to as a  1 \u2212. The + or - sign indicates either upward or downward propagation, respectively. The numeral represents the half-bounce currently in progress. The reflected signal is redesignated  1 +, until passing the geomagnetic equator again; then it is called  2 \u2212, and so on.\n  Whistlers were first detected during World War 1. On the wide-band spectrogram, the observed characteristic of a whistler is that the tone rapidly descends over a few seconds. This is the origin of the name &#34;whistlers&#34;.\n       ^     a     b    Robert A. Helliwell (2006).  Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena.  Dover Publications, Inc.

"note_en": "Swedish prosecutors have named the man who they say killed former Swedish prime minister Olof Palme in 1986, ending years of mystery.\n They identified the suspect as Stig Engstrom, also known as &#34;Skandia Man&#34;, who killed himself in 2000.\n As a result they are closing the investigation into Palme&#39;s death, Chief Prosecutor Krister Petersson said.\n Palme was shot in the back as he walked home from the cinema with his wife Lisbet in Stockholm.\n He had dismissed his security team earlier in the day. The assassination took place on Sweden&#39;s busiest road and more than a dozen witnesses saw the tall man fire the shots before fleeing the scene.\n  Thousands of people have been interviewed over his death. A petty criminal was convicted of the killing but the verdict was later dismissed.\n  Stig Engstrom became known as Skandia Man as he had worked for the Skandia insurance company. He had been working late on the evening of the murder at the the firm&#39;s HQ close to the crime scene.\n Engstrom, who was one of some 20 people who witnessed the assassination, eventually killed himself in 2000.\n He was first identified as a suspect by journalist Thomas Pettersson, and police started looking into Engstrom 18 years after his death. It was suggested Engstrom had killed Palme because of the prime minister&#39;s left-wing views.\n He lied about the moments after the murder, even claiming he had tried to resuscitate Palme. It later emerged he had had weapons training.\n Stig Engstrom&#39;s ex-wife told Expressen newspaper in 2018 that she had been questioned by detectives in 2017. At the time she said the suspicion of his guilt was out of the question.\n    The Swedish prime minister had discharged his guards on a Friday night on 28 February 1986 and had gone to the cinema with his wife Lisbet, their son Marten and his girlfriend.\n Walking with his wife after the film on Stockholm&#39;s busiest street, Sveavagen, they were attacked by a gunman from behind.\n Palme, 59, was shot in the back and died instantly. Bullets were recovered at the scene from a .357 Magnum handgun, but the gun was never found.\n  One man did go to jail. Convicted criminal Christer Pettersson - who has no connection to the prosecutor - was identified in a line-up by Lisbet Palme and jailed for life in 1989.\n But he was quickly released on appeal as no motive had been established and no weapon retrieved.\n   A charismatic prime minister who led Sweden&#39;s Social Democratic party, Plame was also outspoken on several international issues.\n At home he had infuriated business owners with reforms and spoken out against nuclear power.\n He was critical of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the US bombing of North Vietnam and had attacked South Africa&#39;s &#34;gruesome&#34; regime of apartheid.\n  The case has dogged Swedish police for decades. For years it obsessed renowned author Stieg Larsson, who wrote The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n  He stood up against apartheid and funded the African National Congress (ANC) - Swedish police travelled to South Africa in 1996 to investigate the claim\n Palme had discovered that Swedish arms firm Bofors had used bribery to set up an Indian weapons deal", "posttime": "2020-06-10 16:44:45",

"note_en": "Open-source browser Brave, which has become famous for its focus on user privacy, has been caught adding referral codes to typed-in URLs in the address bar.\n The discovery was made by Twitter user  @cryptonator1337 (in the meantime, his findings have also gone viral on other social media sites, including reddit), who noticed that whenever someone manually types binance.us in the address bar, Brave browser auto-completes the URL with a referral code.\n While this isn\u2019t a privacy issue, it\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t sit well with Brave users who expect nothing but full transparency from the app developer.\n And as it turns out, referral codes are being added not only when Binance, but also other websites like Ledger, Trezor, and Coinbase.\n  Brave CEO and co-founder Brendan Eich has already  responded on Twitter, explaining that this is something that\u2019s being resolved as we speak, with all referral codes to be removed in the next update.\n \u201cWe partner with Binance as an affiliate. That code identifies us, not you,\u201d Eich explained.\n Earlier this year, Brave and crypto exchange service Binance signed a partnership that essentially allowed users to trade cryptocurrencies right on the new tab page without the need for any other apps.\n \u201cAll big browsers do this for search affiliate deals (internal accounting in Chrome\u2019s case; it tracks logged in users too). We treated a typed-in domain name as a search, fell into same model for attributing to the partner. We already fixed to default it off,\u201d Eich further added.\n By the looks of things, the referral codes are being added for the sites mentioned above both on the desktop and mobile. A fix is already on its way, so expect an update to resolve the whole blunder any day now on all platforms where Brave is available for download.", "posttime": "2020-06-10 16:27:18", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4ee3\u7801,\u5f00\u6e90,\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668,open,brave", "title": "\u52c7\u6562\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u53d1\u73b0\u5411\u952e\u5165\u7684URL\u6dfb\u52a0\u5f15\u7528\u4ee3\u7801", "title_en": "Brave Open-Source Browser Caught Adding Referral Codes to Typed-In URLs", "transed": 1, "url": "https://news.softpedia.com/news/bravo-open-source-browser-caught-adding-referral-codes-to-typed-in-urls-530198.shtml", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ee3\u7801", "\u5f00\u6e90", "\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668", "open", "brave"]}]
