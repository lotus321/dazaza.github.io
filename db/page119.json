"note_en": "11    Summary:\u00a0Flat interfaces often use weak signifiers. In an eyetracking experiment comparing different kinds of clickability clues, UIs with weak signifiers required more user effort than strong ones.\n    The popularity of  flat design in digital interfaces has coincided with a scarcity of  signifiers. Many modern UIs have ripped out the perceptible cues that users rely on to understand what is clickable.\n Using eyetracking equipment to track and visualize users\u2019 eye movements across interfaces, we investigated how  strong clickability signifiers (traditional clues such as underlined, blue text or a glossy 3D button) and  weak or absent signifiers (for example, linked text styled as static text or a ghost button) impact the ways users process and understand web pages.\n   There are many factors that influence a user\u2019s interaction with an interface. To directly investigate the differences between traditional, weak, and absent signifiers in the visual treatments of interactive elements, we needed to remove any confounding variables.\n We took 9 web pages from live websites and modified them to create two nearly identical versions of each page, with the same layout, content and visual style. The two versions differed only in the use of strong, weak, or absent signifiers for interactive elements (buttons, links, tabs, sliders).\n In some cases, that meant taking an already flat page and adding shadows, gradients, and text treatments to add depth and increase the strength of the clickability signifiers. In other cases, we took a page that already had strong, traditional signifiers, and we created an ultraflat version. We were careful that the modifications we provided were reasonable and realistic.\n  We chose these interfaces as study materials because, for the most part, they\u2019re decent designs that are representative of the better sites on the web. We set out to isolate the differences between signifier-rich and signifier-poor interfaces, not to evaluate the design of these sites.\n   For each of the stimuli pairs, we wrote a short task to direct the user\u2019s attention to a specific interactive element on the page. For example, for the hotel site, the task was: \u201cYou will see a page from a hotel website. Reserve this hotel room. Please tell us when you have found where you would click.\u201d\n All 18 page designs and the wording of all 9 tasks are available in a sidebar.\n  We conducted a quantitative experiment using  eyetracking equipment and a desktop computer. We recruited 71 general web-users to participate in the experiment. Each participant was presented with one version of the 9 sites and given the corresponding task for that page. As soon as participants saw the target UI element that they wanted to click to complete the task, they said \u201cI found it\u201d and stopped.\n We tracked the eye movements of the participants as they were performing these tasks. We measured the number of fixations on each page, as well as the task time. (A fixation happens when the gaze lingers on a spot of interest on the page).\n Both of these measures reflect user effort: the more fixations and time spent doing the task, the higher the processing effort, and the more difficult the task. In addition, we created heatmap visualizations by aggregating the areas that participants looked at the most on the pages.\n The study was conducted as a between-subjects design \u2014 each participant saw only one version of each page. We randomized assignment to either version of each page, as well as the order in which participants saw the pages. (See our course on  Measuring User Experience for more on designing quantitative studies.)\n All participants began with a practice task on the same stimulus to make sure they understood the instructions before they began the real tasks. Especially with quantitative studies like this one, it\u2019s a good idea to use a practice task to ensure that participants understand the instructions. (It\u2019s also best to conduct  pilot testing before even starting the real study to iron out any methodology issues.)\n This experiment was not a usability study. Our goal was to see how users processed individual page designs, and how easily they could find the target elements, not to identify usability problems in the designs. (Usability studies of live sites rarely involve a single page on a website; most often, people are asked to navigate through an entire site to accomplish a goal.)\n   When we compared average number of fixations and average amount of time people spent looking at each page, we found that:\n The  average amount of time was significantly higher on the weak-signifier versions than the strong-signifier versions. On average participants spent  22% more time (i.e., slower task performance) looking at the pages with weak signifiers.\n  The  average number of fixations was significantly higher on the weak-signifier versions than the strong-signifier versions. On average, people had  25% more fixations on the pages with weak signifiers.\n (Both findings were significant by a paired t-test with sites as the random factor, p &lt; 0.05.)\n This means that, when looking at a design with weak signifiers,  users spent more time looking at the page, and they had to look at more elements on the page. Since this experiment used targeted findability tasks,  more time and effort spent looking around the page are not good. These findings don\u2019t mean that users were more \u201cengaged\u201d with the pages. Instead, they suggest that participants struggled to locate the element they wanted, or weren\u2019t confident when they first saw it.\n 22% longer task time for the weak-signifier designs may seem terrible. But remember that our metrics reflect time spent while looking for where to click. The tasks we measured were very specific and represent just a small component of real web tasks. In regular web use, people spend more time on other task aspects such as reading the information on a page. When you add in these other aspects, the slowdown for a full task (such as shopping for a new pair of shoes) would often be less than the 22% we measured.\n On the other hand, the increased click uncertainty in weak-signifier designs is likely to sometimes cause people to click the wrong thing occasionally \u2014 something we didn\u2019t measure in this study. Recovering from incorrect clicks can easily consume more time, especially since users don\u2019t always realize their mistake immediately. Beyond the actual time wasted, the emotional impact of increased uncertainty and decreased empowerment is an example of how mediocre  experience design can hurt brand perception.\n  Heatmaps are quantitative visualizations that aggregate the number and duration of eye fixations on a stimulus (the UI). They can be created from the gaze data of many participants, as long as they all look at the same stimulus with the same task.\n Heatmaps based on all participants\u2019 data convey important information about the page areas that are relevant for the task (provided that the number of participants is high enough). In our color coding, the red areas were those which received the most and longest fixations. Orange, yellow, and purple areas received less attention, and areas with no overlay color were not viewed by any of the test participants.\n When comparing the two versions of each page pair (strong signifiers vs. weak signifiers) we found that the pages fell into two groups: those with nearly identical user gaze patterns for the two versions, and those with different user gaze patterns (as indicated by the heatmaps).\n  Of the pages we tested,  6 out of the 9 pairs had different user gaze patterns. With the exception of the signifier strength, we eliminated all other variations in page design within a given pair, so we can conclude that  the signifiers changed how users processed the page in their task.\n One major overarching difference emerged when comparing the 6 pairs of page. The weak-signifier versions of the pages resulted in a broader distribution of fixations across the page:  people had to look around more. This result reinforced our findings that weak-signifier pages required more fixations and more time than strong-signifier ones.\n We never saw the reverse pattern: no strong-signifier version had a more outspread distribution than its weak-signifier counterpart.\n  This difference suggests that participants had to  consider more potentially interactive elements in the weak-signifier versions. Because the target elements (links, tabs, buttons, sliders) lacked strong, traditional signifiers, they  didn\u2019t have the same power to draw the participants\u2019 attention or confidence. In many cases, participants fixated on the target element, but then moved on to other elements on the page \u2014 presumably because they hadn\u2019t immediately recognized it as the solution to the task.\n    Of the six sites, one page pair displayed a particularly dramatic difference in the heatmaps. The original interface used to create the stimuli was a zig-zag layout from a fine-jewelry website. The page layout featured three sections, each with a heading, short paragraph of text, product image, and text link.\n To create the strong version of the page, the text links were given a traditional link treatment: blue color and underlined text. To create the weak version, we took inspiration from a common tactic of ultraflat designs, and made the text links identical to the static text. The placement of the text links (below the paragraphs) was left the same in both stimuli.\n  Participants were asked to find the pearl jewelry on the site. The intended target was a  Shop Pearl link at the bottom of the page.\n   The weak-signifier version showed red areas on the primary navigation, as well as on the  3 Year: Pearl heading. In contrast, the target link received most fixations in the strong-signifier variant. When we inspected the individual-participant data, we discovered that many users (9 of the 24 participants) who saw the weak signifier version stopped at the subheading, and never looked at the text link. They believed they could click on that subheading to reach the pearl jewelry and didn\u2019t continue down to see the link.\n In the strong signifier version, 86% (25 out of 29) participants first fixated on the heading, and then moved to the  Shop Pearl target link. In the weak version, only 50% (12 out of 24) followed this pattern. (This difference is statistically significant; p &lt; 0.005.) The links styled like static text didn\u2019t draw users\u2019 eyes down from the subheading, while the strong, traditionally styled links did.\n  3 of the 9 sites resulted in no differences in the gaze patterns between strong and weak signifiers. Why are these three page pairs nearly identical, while the other six pairs showed substantial differences?\n The answers give us some interesting information about  when flat UIs can work without damaging interaction.\n One of the stimulus pairs had in-line text links as the target element: light purple, nonunderlined links vs. traditional blue, underlined links. In this pair, the weak-stimulus heatmap only showed a very slightly wider distribution of fixations on the paragraph containing the target link.\n  This suggests that the low-contrast presentation of in-line links, compared with regular text, may be a slightly weaker signifier, but not perceptibly so. In the case of Brilliant Earth, the lack of contrasting color for links, however, had a big impact, as shown above. We can speculate that there is a contrast continuum: the stronger the color contrast between links and surrounding text, the higher the chance that users will recognize them.\u00a0 If we had used a light grey highlight color in the weak version of Ally Bank, we might expect to the see a more dramatic difference in the gaze patterns.  As long as in-line text links are   presented in a contrasting color , users will recognize their purpose, even without an underline.\n The other two stimulus pairs with no discernible heatmap differences between the weak and strong versions had some traits in common, when compared to the rest of the stimuli:\n Low information density. The pages contained relatively little content and ample white space, meaning that even things that didn\u2019t stand out much still did stand out, because they weren\u2019t competing with many other page elements.\n  Traditional layout. Elements (buttons, links, navigation) were located in standard positions, where users typically expect them to be.\n  Salient, high-contrast targets. The target elements were high-contrast compared to the items around them, and had plenty of space to separate them from those elements, making them more noticeable.\n  We want our users to have experiences that are easy, seamless, and enjoyable. Users need to be able to look at a page, and understand their options immediately. They need to be able to glance at what they\u2019re looking for and know instantly, \u201cYep, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n The problem is not that users never see a weakly signified UI element. It\u2019s that even when they do see the weak element, they don\u2019t feel confident that it is what they want, so they keep looking around the page.\n Designs with  weak clickability signifiers waste users\u2019 time: people need to look at more UI elements and spend more time on the page, as captured by heatmaps, average counts of fixations, and average task time. These findings all suggest that with weak signifiers, users are  getting less of that feeling of empowerment and decisiveness. They\u2019re experiencing click uncertainty.\n  These findings also confirm that flat or flat-ish designs can work better in certain conditions than others. As we saw in this experiment, the potential negative consequences of weak signifiers are diminished when the site has a low information density, traditional or consistent layout, and places important interactive elements where they stand out from surrounding elements.\n Ideally, to avoid click uncertainty, all three of those criteria should be met, not just one or two. A site with a substantial amount of potentially overwhelming content, or radically new page layouts or patterns, should proceed with caution when adopting an ultraflat design. These characteristics echo  our recommendations for adopting a flat UI without damaging the interaction on your site.\n Notice that those characteristics are also just good,  basic UX design best practice: visual simplicity, external consistency, clear visual hierarchy, and contrast. In general, if you have an experienced UX team that cares about user research, you\u2019ll do better with a flat design than other product teams that don\u2019t. If your designs are already strong, any potential weakness introduced by flat design will be mitigated. If you\u2019re conducting regular user research, any mistakes you make in implementing a flat UI will be identified and corrected.\n  To get comparable, interpretable results from this experiment, we had to ask users to do very focused, short tasks on a single page. In real life, users don\u2019t do tasks that way. They arrive to your site, and don\u2019t know who you are or what you do. They navigate to pages, and don\u2019t know for sure that they\u2019ll find what they\u2019re looking for there. They explore offerings and options.\n Remember that there\u2019s a difference between  findability and discoverability. Strong signifiers are helpful in situations where users care about finding something specific. They\u2019re absolutely crucial in situations where  you care that users discover a feature that they didn\u2019t know existed.\n  Note:\u00a0This article&#39;s publication generated a significant amount of debate about flat design.

"note_en": "The non-profit removed lending restrictions on over a million books during the COVID-19 crisis. Now it&#39;s being sued by publishers.\n   The Internet Archive removed waitlists for books in its &#34;National Emergency Library&#34; so that multiple readers could simultaneously download the same digital copy.\n Four major book publishers have responded by suing the Internet Archive. If successful, they could bankrupt the nonprofit.\n The publishers take issue not only with the National Emergency Library, but with the Internet Archive as a whole.\n The  Internet Archive  is a massive endeavor\u2014it&#39;s an  online library aiming to &#34;provide Universal Access to All Knowledge.&#34; It has digitized millions of web pages, movies, photos, recordings, software programs, and books that might otherwise be lost to history.\n But it&#39;s neither un-censorable nor outside the bounds of copyright law. And now open internet supporters are wondering how to save it before it disappears.\n In March, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to the shutdown of public libraries, the Internet Archive created the   National Emergency Library  and temporarily suspended book waitlists\u2014the kind that make you cool your jets for 12 weeks to download &#34;A Game of Thrones&#34; onto your Kindle\u2014through the end of June. In doing so, it essentially allowed for a single copy of a book to be downloaded an infinite number of times.\n   Book publishers weren&#39;t happy. Last Monday, Hachette, HarperCollins, Penguin Random House, and Wiley\u2014four publishing behemoths\u2014sued the organization. The lawsuit argues that &#34;IA\u2019s actions grossly exceed legitimate library services, do violence to the Copyright Act, and constitute willful digital piracy on an industrial scale.&#34;\n Perhaps in response, today the Internet Archive announced it was closing the National Emergency Library two weeks early. Founder Brewster Kahle wrote that he hoped the plaintiffs would &#34;  call off their costly assault .&#34;\n If the court finds that Internet Archive   &#34;willfully&#34; infringed copyright , the library could be on the hook for up to $150,000 in damages\u2014per   each  of the 1.4 million titles. (You do the math.)\n  That would likely be game over for the archive. Even an unintentional act of copyright infringement carries statutory damages of at least $200, which would put damages in the hundreds of millions.\n Many are preparing for the worst, a complete shutdown, but doing so is no easy feat. Many open-Internet activists have been discussing how to   back up the archive  and make it more resilient for years. The temptation would be to employ a distributed system, such as a blockchain, that would be censorship-resistant and couldn\u2019t be legally shut down. Yet the amount of data makes any attempt at backing up the archive difficult.\n The INTERNETARCHIVE.BAK project aimed to scope out the viability of archiving the Internet Archive\u2019s data, which numbers in the   peta bytes. It has been inactive since 2016. Other projects have similarly stalled.\n Some decentralization stalwarts and open-information advocates are urging people to donate or rally to the organization\u2019s side. Doing so would help it pay for legal costs and perhaps buy time to move some of the archive\u2019s resources elsewhere.\n      According to the publishers, copyright violations are damaging to the industry, which makes money off of selling to libraries and bookstores alike. According to the   Denver Public Library,  &#34;Libraries pay three-to-five times more than retail price for eBook access. If an individual is charged $15 for an eBook license, a library often pays $50 or even $84 for one license.&#34;\n That price model makes sense since eBooks make the rounds to multiple library users. And if librarians face large demand for popular titles, they may have to buy multiple licenses\u2014otherwise readers might face a very long wait.\n Kahle has urged reconciliation. &#34;Publishers suing libraries for lending books, in this case protected digitized versions, and while schools and libraries are closed, is not in anyone\u2019s interest,\u201d he   wrote on the organization&#39;s blog . &#34;We hope this can be resolved quickly.&#34;\n  But given the tone of the lawsuit, the publishers take issue with Internet Archive&#39;s mission as a whole, suggesting that they were waiting for some pretext to take the entire organization down: &#34;Without any license or any payment to authors or publishers, [Internet Archive] scans print books, uploads these illegally scanned books to its servers, and distributes verbatim digital copies of the books   in whole  via public-facing websites.&#34;\n With the publishers seemingly out for blood, all of the digital archives are at risk. Those who rely on it to keep a digital history of our world may be running out of time, though the last chapter has yet to be written.", "posttime": "2020-06-11 12:51:29", "source_domain":

"note_en": "Blosc is a  high performance compressor optimized for binarydata. It has been designed to transmit data to the processor cachefaster than the traditional, non-compressed, direct memory fetchapproach via a  memcpy() OS call. Blosc is the first compressor (thatI&#39;m aware of) that is meant not only to reduce the size of largedatasets on-disk or in-memory, but also to accelerate memory-boundcomputations (which is typical in vector-vector operations).\n It uses the  blocking technique (as described in this  article) to reduceactivity on the memory bus as much as possible. In short, theblocking technique works by dividing datasets in blocks that are smallenough to fit in L1 cache of modern processor and performcompression/decompression there. It also leverages  SIMD (SSE2)and  multi-threading capabilities present in nowadays multi-coreprocessors so as to accelerate the compression/decompression processto a maximum.\n   You can see more benchmarks in  Synthetic Benchmarks. Also, you may want to check out this article on  Breaking Down Memory Walls with  Blosc2, the next generation of Blosc.\n    Blosc was initially developed for the needs of the  PyTables database and the  bcolz project, although it may be usedelsewhere where a fast compressor is needed. Also, you may want touse the new  Bloscpack format and reference implementation for much easier access to themain Blosc features and benefits, also from the command line.\n Applications using Blosc/Bloscpack are expected to allow I/Operformance to go beyond expected physical limits. For example, PyTables benefits from Blosc for itsindexing and query operations in extremely large tables. Evenin-memory computations can go faster in some cases as well (forexample, see  this IPython notebook)\n The PyTables community has contributed  testing Blosc very hard, and I&#39;m happy to say that, since version 0.9.5 on,it  worked flawlessly compressing and decompressing hundreds ofTerabytes (coming from the  hardsuite and  extremesuite in theincluded benchmark) on many different Windows and Unix boxes, both in32-bit and 64-bit. Of course, that does not mean that Blosc doesn&#39;tcontain bugs, but just that  grave bugs are unlikely.\n Moreover, with the introduction of Blosc 1.0, it has been declaredstable, and both the  API and the format have been frozen, so youshould expect a large degree of stability for your Blosc-poweredapplications.\n    Bloscpack, a serialization format using Blosc and a referenceimplementaion, is equipped with a nice command line tool which cancompress existing binary datasets on-disk. It also has built-insupport for compressing and serializing Numpy arrays, both in-memoryand on-disk:\n  Although the format may still mutate, Bloscpack is making largestrides for becoming a great utility.\n Your contribution is very important to make Blosc as solid as possible. Ifyou detect a bug or wish to propose an enhancement, feel free to open a newticket or make yourself heard on the mailinglist. Also, you can contribute tothis project by simply compiling and running different benchmark and testsuites on your own hardware, as explained in the  SyntheticBenchmarks page.\n Blosc is free software and released under the terms of the verypermissive  BSD license,so you can use it in almost any way you want!", "posttime": "2020-06-11 11:28:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about  Edward Hopper. So have other stay-at-homes, I notice online. The visual bard of American solitude\u2014not loneliness, a maudlin projection\u2014speaks to our isolated states these days with fortuitous poignance. But he is always doing that, pandemic or no pandemic. Aloneness is his great theme, symbolizing America: insecure selfhoods in a country that is only abstractly a nation. \u201cE pluribus unum,\u201d a magnificent ideal, thuds on \u201cunum\u201d every day throughout the land. Only law\u2014we\u2019re a polity of lawyers\u2014confers unity on the United States, which might sensibly be a Balkans of regional sovereignties had the Civil War not been so awful as to remove that option, come what may. Hopper\u2019s region is the Northeast, from New York to parts of New England, but his perceptions apply from coast to coast. Born in Nyack in 1882, and dying in 1967 after living for half a century in an apartment on Washington Square, he couldn\u2019t conceivably have developed as he did in any other culture. His subjects\u2014atomized persons, inauspicious places\u2014are specific to his time. But his mature art, which took two decades to gestate before consolidating in the nineteen-twenties, is timeless, or perhaps time-free: a series of freeze-dried, uncannily telling moments.\n  Though termed a realist, Hopper is more properly a Symbolist, investing objective appearance with clenched, melancholy subjectivity. He was an able draftsman and masterly as a painter of light and shadow, but he ruthlessly subordinated aesthetic pleasure to the compacted description\u2014as dense as uranium\u2014of things that answered to his feelings without exposing them. Nearly every house that he painted strikes me as a self-portrait, with brooding windows and almost never a visible or, should one be indicated, inviting door. If his pictures sometimes seem awkwardly forced, that\u2019s not a flaw; it\u2019s a guarantee that he has pushed the communicative capacities of painting to their limits, then a little bit beyond. He leaves us alone with our own solitude, taking our breath away and not giving it back. Regarding his human subjects as \u201clonely\u201d evades their truth. We might freak out if we had to be those people, but\u2014look!\u2014they\u2019re doing O.K., however grim their lot. Think of Samuel Beckett\u2019s famous tag \u201cI can\u2019t go on. I\u2019ll go on.\u201d Now delete the first sentence. With Hopper, the going-on is not a choice.\n I haven\u2019t seen \u201cEdward Hopper: A Fresh Look at Landscape,\u201d a large show at the lately reopened Beyeler Foundation, Switzerland\u2019s premier museum of modern art, outside Basel. I take its  fine catalogue, edited by the exhibition\u2019s curator, Ulf K\u00fcster, as occasion enough for reflecting anew on the artist\u2019s stubborn force. I rely as well on memories that we likely share of encountering \u201cNighthawks\u201d (1942) and \u201cEarly Sunday Morning\u201d (1930), but also, really, anything from his hand. Once you\u2019ve seen a Hopper, it stays seen, lodged in your mind\u2019s eye. The reason, beyond exacting observation and authentic feeling, is an exceptional stylistic cleverness. Hopper was explicit on this score, saying, in 1933, \u201cI have tried to present my sensations in what is the most congenial and impressive form possible to me.\u201d Exasperated by questions of what his works meant, he squelched one interviewer by exclaiming, \u201cI\u2019m after ME.\u201d The remark reflects his debts to European Romanticism and Symbolism, which he absorbed in depth while stripping away any stylistic resemblances. Highly literate, he read and reread nineteenth-century German and French poetry all his life. His poetic liberties in a realist mode point back to one of his favorite predecessors,  Gustave Courbet. And a certain smoldering vehemence in Hopper puts me in mind of Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, except tamped down to static views of drab actualities. Hopper imported, or smuggled, some emotive powers of European traditions to unforgiving American soil.\n    Having studied in New York with Robert Henri and other preceptors of the Ashcan School, who addressed modernity with vernacular realism, he had three sojourns in Paris. There he emulated minor Post-Impressionists with restless variations of tonal contrasts and off-kilter compositions. Back home, while supporting himself as a commercial illustrator, he found a way forward by way of etching. Heavily inked cows, railroad tracks, and a banal house in \u201cAmerican Landscape\u201d (1920) presaged a direction unlike that of any of his contemporaries. The closest was his mystically inclined acquaintance Charles Burchfield, whose rapturous treatments of unprepossessing sites in western New York State have aged very well, informing a trend today among young painters toward potent representation. Less imitable, Hopper has never ceased to influence the thinking, at the very least, of subsequent artists.  Willem de Kooning, as K\u00fcster recounts in the catalogue, praised him to an interviewer in 1959. De Kooning noted a startling effect of the summarily brushed woods in the background of \u201cCape Cod Morning\u201d (1950), in which a woman is seen from the side leaning forward at a bay window and staring at something beyond the picture\u2019s right edge: \u201cThe forest looks real, like a forest, like you turn on it and there it is, like you turn and actually see it.\u201d That\u2019s on the mark with Hopper: thereness that becomes hereness, in a viewer\u2019s eye and mind.\n  A catalogue essay by David\u00a0M. Lubin, the esteemed scholar of art history in relation to popular culture, makes a connection that I\u2019ve often thought about myself: Hopper and  Alfred Hitchcock. The Yank painter and the Brit cin\u00e9aste display remarkable parallels as visual storytellers. Hitchcock, learning American experience from scratch after immigrating to Hollywood in 1939, at the age of thirty-nine, acknowledged the influence. The Bates house in \u201cPsycho\u201d reproduces, with simplifications, the already suitably ominous Victorian in Hopper\u2019s \u201cHouse by the Railroad\u201d (1925). Lubin concentrates on suspenseful narrative tactics, which I would enlarge to cover methods of composition and aspects of temperament. Hitchcock storyboarded scenes and shots for his films. Hopper (incidentally, an addicted moviegoer) as much as did the same for his paintings. I once got to inspect a stack of studies that he\u2019d made on paper. Some sheets bore only drawn rectangles: seeking the right proportions for what he had in mind. Then there were congeries of details with which he auditioned, in effect, particular body parts, architectural features, or other elements that would be knitted into dramatic wholes. Both he and Hitchcock aimed for the soundness and the suddenness of sights that compress time in service to a pre-imagined vision. Each knew the feeling\u2014because he felt it\u2014that the effort would trigger in viewers.\n Hitchcock shares with Hopper a predilection for jarring relations of backgrounds to foregrounds in pictorial space: perhaps someone or something relatively innocuous is nearby and something less calming is yonder. Lubin offers the example, from \u201cNorth by Northwest,\u201d of the distant crop-dusting plane at work \u201cwhere there ain\u2019t no crops.\u201d In certain pictures of rural dwellings by Hopper, woods (like those in \u201cCape Cod Morning\u201d) or topographical formations subtly menace a human intrusion. But in Hitchcock\u2019s work, and in Hopper\u2019s, especially, the unnerving relation of the far to the near is often reversed, and what\u2019s mysterious, if not sinister, becomes identical with our point of view. What are we doing here, seeing that? Voyeurism\u2014the saddest excitement\u2014may be suggested. The emotional tug of many of Hitchcock\u2019s characters and all of Hopper\u2019s requires their unawareness of being looked at. To see them is to take on a peculiar responsibility. Hopper often produces the unease even in unpeopled landscapes and views of buildings, as if catching nature and habitation defenselessly exposed in disarray, mundanity, or squalor. The New England coastlines, lighthouses, and sailboats that he painted on summer excursions get off relatively easy. He liked them. But they, too, feel taken by surprise, depicted from odd angles of vision. No judgment is passed on anyone or anything, one way or another. The naked fact of their existence is provocative enough. \u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d cosmologists wonder. Hopper is all ears for the answer.\n  Politically, Hopper was \u201ca sort of McKinley conservative,\u201d his friend the novelist John Dos Passos remarked. The artist scorned the New Deal art programs of the thirties as sops to mediocrity. Interrupting a vacation on Cape Cod in 1940, he returned to New York to register to vote in order to cast his ballot against Franklin Roosevelt. The orientation leaves no mark in his work that I can detect\u2014Hopper\u2019s artistic passion disallowed the trivia of opinionating\u2014but it chimes with a wary individualism that could seem to refuse agreement about practically everything with almost everybody except his painter wife, Josephine Nivison. Having first met as art students around 1905, they married in 1924 and were symbiotically a unit. (Their closeness strikingly recalls that of Hitchcock\u2019s taut, creatively collaborative marriage with the screenwriter Alma Reville.) Nivison supervised a detailed ledger of all Hopper\u2019s works and served, at her insistence and with his consent, as his only model when he painted nudes. She was as vivacious as he was taciturn. (She once joked that talking with him was like dropping a rock down a well and waiting to hear it hit, in vain.) Hopper\u2019s last painting, \u201cTwo Comedians\u201d (1965), pictures the pair of them in commedia-dell\u2019arte costume as Pierrot and Pierrette on a stage, taking a bow.\n Nivison aside, or standing guard, Hopper\u2019s independence feels absolute, repelling attempts to associate him with any other artist or social group. In this, he updates and passes along to the future the spirit of a paradigmatically American text, \u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d minus Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s optimism. The free, questing citizen has devolved into one or another of millions rattling around on a comfortless continent. Can you pledge patriotic allegiance to a void? Hopper shows how, exploring a condition in which, by being separate, we belong together. You don\u2019t have to like the idea, but, once you\u2019ve truly experienced this painter\u2019s art, it is as impossible to ignore as a stone in your shoe.\u00a0\u2666", "posttime": "2020-06-11 11:27:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7231\u5fb7\u534e,hopper,\u7f8e\u56fd", "title": "\u7231\u5fb7\u534e\u00b7\u970d\u73c0\u4e0e\u201c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b64\u72ec\u201d", "title_en": "Edward Hopper and American Solitude", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/edward-hopper-and-american-solitude", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7231\u5fb7\u534e", "hopper", "\u7f8e\u56fd"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1006096, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4f7f\u7528MongoDB\u9886\u57df\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5f00\u53d1\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5728Android\u3001iOS\u548cWeb\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u6d41\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u8ba9\u60a8\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u843d\u5165\u7528\u6237\u624b\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u60a8\u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u5df2\u7ecf\u5185\u7f6e\u3002\n\u201cMongoDB\u9886\u57df\u6781\u5927\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u89e3\u9501\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u5b83\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u4e0a\u5e02\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u53ef\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u201c--CBT\u6398\u91d1\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u5e08Isaac Overacker\u3002\n\u4ece\u8d22\u5bcc500\u5f3a\u7684\u4e2d\u6d41\u7825\u67f1\u5230\u9886\u5148\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u8d85\u8fc735K\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ef\u4f9b\u4e0b\u8f7d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u90fd\u662f\u738b\u56fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u7684\u3002\n\u201c\u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528@Realm\uff1a\u8fd9\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u90a3\u4e48\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\u6211\u5f88\u786e\u5b9a\u6211\u9519\u8fc7\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\u201c\u3002\n\u201c\u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528@Realm\uff1a\u8fd9\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u90a3\u4e48\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\u6211\u5f88\u786e\u5b9a\u6211\u9519\u8fc7\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\u201c", "note_en": "Build best in-class-apps across android, iOS, and web with MongoDB\u2019s Realm\u2019s intuitive app development services.

"note_en": "Employee Motivation    We\u2019re going through one of the toughest times newer generations have had to face to date. Focus less on managing a remote team for the first time, and more on being a true people leader.\n   A few months ago, the majority of managers felt that the most important part of their role was to  keep the team on track to achieve goals. But, times have changed.\n We\u2019re going through one of  the toughest times newer generations have had to face to date.\n With the onset of a global pandemic, the world has rapidly changed \u2014 and the workplace right along with it. For many of us, it\u2019s hardly business as usual. Even if we\u2019ve been able to adjust and adapt, there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty and fear. As people managers, we need to focus on the  people part of our jobs more than ever before.\n Before COVID-19, managers turned their attention toward the usual topics, like hitting team goals, fostering individual growth and development opportunities, eliminating blockers, the list goes on. Now, however, many have had to make a sudden and unexpected shift in focus towards controlling or cutting costs, making extremely hard decisions and laying off talented people on their team\u2026 Most likely over a video call, I might add.\n At the same time, managers and their teams have been forced to navigate through a slew of health and safety concerns, not to mention working \u201cremotely\u201d possibly for the first time, at a moment\u2019s notice, with children home from school, all the while supporting their families through a global pandemic.\n  There are, however, things managers can do to make this uncertain, often scary, situation feel a little more manageable for all those involved.\n In this article we\u2019ll walk through some tips to help you better lead your team through a crisis:\n   Let yourself and your team know that this isn\u2019t (just) remote work, it\u2019s working through a crisis\n If you\u2019ve been on the internet lately, you\u2019ll notice that a lot of people, who are new to remote work might I add, are suddenly \u201cexperts\u201d in this domain. Are there real remote work experts? Absolutely. People like  Dana Doswell and  Marcus Wermuth are certainly experts when it comes to remote work. But, they\u2019re also admittedly struggling in this new working environment.  No one is an expert at this. Some people might be handling it better than others, but by no means are they experts.\n Remind yourself that although you\u2019re not working in an office right now, you\u2019re not working remotely; You\u2019re working in a crisis.\n \u201cThere are employees working at a desk with their laptop on a pot; Executives working from a fold-out chair. This isn\u2019t remote work. This is \u2018work homelessness\u2019. Everyone\u2019s been evicted from their offices.\u201d\n -Ryan Merkley, Chief of Staff at  Wikimedia\n There are so many remote work experts and advocates who have recently admitted they\u2019re also struggling to do their jobs. The challenges that you, your team and company are currently facing likely has less to do with your remote setting, and more to do with the stressful environment we\u2019re currently facing, which can take a toll on motivation and productivity.\n Don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. Understand that most people are going through similar things to you, including those who are remote work experts.\n  The current situation is quite hard on a lot of us! For those of you that are forced to work from home, and never really experienced it \u2013 please reach out to me. I am happy to make a few time slots available to chat and see how I can be of help! \ud83e\udd17 #remotework  #covid19  pic.twitter.com/ycv8uksMIG\n\u2014 Marcus Wermuth (@mwermuth)  March 10, 2020\n     1. Check-in on them. It can be as simple as sending them a quick message:\n Hey [name], I know this feels like a tough time. I\u2019m feeling it too. Is there anything I can do to help make work a little easier to manage right now? Happy to hop on a call whenever!\u201d\n 2. Confirm the easiest working times every morning. Maybe someone\u2019s kids are having an extra bad day and they need the morning to manage that situation. Check-in with your team to see when the best time of day is for everyone to work or meet.\n Good morning team! I just wanted to check in and see what everyone\u2019s day is looking like? I\u2019m hoping that we can have a meeting about X today and want to see what the best time of day is for each of you. The best time for me is X, but I can be flexible.\n  Some people are more analytical and want to talk about the numbers, like how many new cases were confirmed that day. Others might want to ignore the issue altogether. Take into account how your team thinks, feels and communicates so that, when you do meet, you\u2019re not making matters worse.\n   Don\u2019t expect your team to be extremely productive right now. Remember, we\u2019re in the middle of a global pandemic. Whether you\u2019re experiencing layoffs, don\u2019t have a great work from home setup, or you\u2019re simply struggling to concentrate with barking dogs or kids in the background, there\u2019s plenty of stress to go around.\n Managers: please give your folks permission to be unproductive. This isn\u2019t normal. The extra cognitive load is not easily pushed back.\n\u2014 Natalie Nagele (@natalienagele)  March 13, 2020\n  It\u2019s unfair to both you and your team to expect them to perform at the same caliber they did pre-pandemic. With the heightened level of stress, anxiety, confusion and even isolation, everyone\u2019s mental health is in a fragile state right now. Adjust your expectations so that you\u2019re still producing great work, without adding unnecessary strain on your team.\n  If you\u2019re not sure what adjusting your expectations looks like, here are a few things that I\u2019m doing to minimize stress levels, get satisfaction from small wins and connect with the team:\n Pick one thing with each person on your team every day. If that gets done, count it as a win!\n Celebrate wins  more. Did someone put a smile on your face? Did you hear great feedback from a customer? Lower your bar for the wins you share as a team. With so much negativity in the world, it\u2019s nice to weave in as much positivity as possible.\n Allow yourself to have a bad day. Let your team know that they\u2019re allowed to have bad days too.\n Encourage people to work when they\u2019re most productive. Whether it\u2019s in the early morning or at night, make it a point that everyone on the team needs to be more flexible and work around each others\u2019 new schedules.\n  When there\u2019s a global crisis happening, a  monthly one-on-one simply won\u2019t cut it. Folks are struggling with enough challenges as it is \u2014 feeling disconnected or not supported by your manager shouldn\u2019t be one of them.\n You don\u2019t need to mandate this, but at the very least, give your team more opportunities to share their challenges, ideas and to talk about different ways to keep each other motivated. As the situation progresses and the economic landscape continues to change, your direct reports will likely have more questions and thoughts they\u2019re going to want to run by you. Don\u2019t let things fester. Aim for weekly\u00a0 one-on-ones, at the very least.\n  Not sure what to ask? Below are some  one-on-one questions you can add to your meeting agenda, which will help you better navigate leading your team right now:\n What\u2019s something you\u2019re looking forward to doing once this is all over?\n  Humans innately need to belong, and that feeling doesn\u2019t stop in the workplace. A  study by the Center for Talent Innovation found that when people feel like they belong at work, they\u2019re more productive, motivated, engaged and 3.5 times more likely to contribute to their fullest potential.\n Making the effort to check in on your team and how they\u2019re doing will add to that sense of belonging. A simple gesture like this will let people know that you care about them and their wellbeing. This simple question will go a long way.\n  If this seems like something that\u2019s out of the norm for your management style, you\u2019ve got some major ground to cover. You need to start building trust with your team\u2014over a video call\u2014in a short period of time.\n     I have had an extremely tough time since we went into city-wide quarantine in Toronto (except essential services). I didn\u2019t realize how much face-to-face human interaction fueled me, let alone how much my direct team motivated me to work. Since then, I\u2019ve been trying really,  really hard to find ways to motivate myself. Sometimes certain things will work and other times nothing will.\n However, what worked best was when my manager and I had a very candid, vulnerable moment with one another; We\u2019re both stressed out and facing new challenges that we really hadn\u2019t pre-pandemic. We set new expectations and decided on tricks we could do to keep one another motivated on a day-by-day basis. Since having that conversation my motivation has, comparably, skyrocketed. That sense of support and togetherness gave me the closest thing to  real human interaction at work.\n Although I\u2019m usually a completely open book, not everyone is. As a manager, you need to understand that you\u2019re in a position of power in your relationship with your direct reports. So,  be vulnerable first. Set the tone that when you\u2019re speaking with one another, it\u2019s a safe space to share these types of things.\n  Psychological safety is one of the  most important things any team should be striving to have and it\u2019s arguably more important to have now. Following the success of Google\u2019s Project Oxygen, they launched  Project Aristotle in an effort to identify what dynamics made up an effective team. Their biggest key finding was that it was less about who was on the team, and more about how the team worked together.\n     Amy Edmonson, a Harvard professor presented a Ted talk on  Building a Psychologically Safe Workplace. In her talk she highlighted three key areas to focus on:\n  Within your organization or team, recognize and be explicit that there\u2019s enormous uncertainty ahead, and a high level of interdependence. Use language that will encourage people to open up, rather than feel like they\u2019re being blamed for something.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve never been here before and we don\u2019t know what to expect. Let\u2019s work together as a team to figure out how to best move forward. To do this successfully, we\u2019re going to need everyone\u2019s voices and perspectives.\u201d\n  In other words, be vulnerable. You\u2019re not perfect and there\u2019s no reason that you need to be. Be honest with your team on how you\u2019re doing, what challenges you\u2019re facing (and your wins). Set the tone for your team so that opening up is something that is not only normal but encouraged. Edmonson claims that something as simple as recognizing your imperfections will create more safety for speaking up. This can be a statement that as simple as:\n \u201cI\u2019m struggling a lot right now. Since we\u2019ve started to work from home, I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m really not productive during the day, but extremely productive at night because the kids are in bed and I\u2019m able to give work my full, undivided attention. I know it might not be the most ideal, but I hope that we can all work to best accommodate one another in this situation.\u201d\n   Make it the norm to ask questions. Creating an environment of curiosity will allow your team to engage in more open dialogue and, as time goes by, feel more comfortable speaking among the group. Asking questions also creates a necessity for voice. However, be sure the questions are coming from a curious nature rather than an accusatory one. For example:\n \ud83d\udeabYou should really figure out a schedule with your partner so that you\u2019re available for our team meetings. Are you able to do this by tomorrow?\n       Know of a resource that should be included in this list?

"note_en": "Mining giant BHP Billiton is poised to destroy at least 40 \u2013 and possibly as many as 86 \u2013 significant Aboriginal sites in the central Pilbara to expand its $4.5bn South Flank iron ore mining operation, even though its own reports show it is aware that the traditional owners are deeply opposed to the move.\n In documents seen by Guardian Australia, a  BHP archaeological survey identified rock shelters that were occupied between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago and noted that evidence in the broader area showed \u201coccupation of the surrounding landscape has been ongoing for approximately 40,000 years\u201d.\n BHP\u2019s report in September 2019 identified 22 sites of artefacts scatters, culturally modified trees, rock shelters with painted rock art, stone arrangements, and 40 \u201cbuilt structures \u2026 believed to be potential archaeological sites\u201d.\n  Under section 18 of the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act, the traditional owners \u2013 in this case the Banjima people \u2013 are unable to lodge objections or to prevent their sacred sites from being damaged.\n They are also unable to raise concerns publicly about the expansion, having signed comprehensive agreements with BHP as part of a native title settlement. BHP agreed to financial and other benefits for the Banjima people, while the Banjima made commitments to support the South Flank project.\n But the Banjima native title holders told the WA government in April they did not want any of the 86 archaeological sites within the project area to be damaged, saying the \u201cimpending harm\u201d to the area \u201cis a further significant cumulative loss to the cultural values of the Banjima people\u201d.\n Guardian Australia has seen correspondence from an archaeological advisor to the Banjima to the WA government in April this year in which they say they \u201cin no way support the continued destruction of this significant cultural landscape\u201d but \u201care equally aware\u201d they cannot formally object to the section 18 application.\n This letter in April followed one sent in December 2019 in which the native title holders said: \u201cThe significance of the sites impacted by the notice to Banjima people is such that Banjima people cannot and do not support the destruction of those sites as proposed by the Notice as to do so would be inconsistent with their cultural obligations to protect those sites.\u201d They would \u201csuffer spiritual and physical harm if they are destroyed\u201d.\n They said they were \u201cworried about the cumulative impact of so many sites being the subject of a single notice for destruction and that not one of the sites is deemed worthy of protection in situ by BHP\u201d.\n BHP\u2019s 2019 report said \u201cit had taken into account the views and recommendations provided by the Banjima representatives during the consultation and inspection\u201d but decided it was  \u201cnot reasonably practicable for BHP to avoid the eighty-six (86) potential archaeological sites\u201d at the South Flank mine development area.\n BHP suggested the areas could be excavated, salvaged or deconstructed but also noted the Banjima did not want any of the objects or heritage values within the 86 potential archaeological sites to be removed or relocated.\n BHP also offered to engage \u201ca suitably qualified expert to digitally capture the extent and form of each stone arrangement using DPGS and drone footage, with a view of creating a three-dimensional computer model and video\u201d.\n \u201cAny cultural material salvaged as part of these programs shall be stored in the cultural repository at the BHP Mulla Mulla Heritage Office until a different location is nominated by the Banjima people,\u201d the company\u2019s assessment report said.\n All 86 sites identified in the BHP application were assessed by the Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee, which controls the protection of heritage, but only 40 were considered by the ACMC to meet the threshold required to be a protected heritage site, despite the Banjima saying all 86 should be protected.\n  \u201cWe speak regularly with the Banjima community and have reiterated our commitment to working closely with them through the lifecycle of the South Flank development to minimise impacts on cultural heritage,\u201d a spokesman for BHP said.\n  The revelations follow the  apology last week by the chief executive of Rio Tinto iron ore, Chris Salisbury, for destroying the rock shelter in Juukan Gorge, which was blown up in mining works at the Brockman 4 iron ore mine near Tom Price in the Pilbara region on 24 May,\u00a0 saying there had been a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d with traditional owners\u00a0the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people.\n On Tuesday, more than 300 protesters gathered in face masks outside the company\u2019s offices on St George\u2019s Terrace in Perth to call for Salisbury\u2019s resignation.\n  Protest organiser Robert Eggington, a Noongar man, said  Rio Tinto had exploited the weakness of WA\u2019s 48-year-old Aboriginal heritage laws, which have been under review for two years.\n \u201cThey used that against the people and then turned and blamed [it on] misunderstandings between the company and the custodians of that site,\u201d Eggington said.\n Rio Tinto received ministerial consent under the WA legislation to destroy the site in 2013. That legislation\u00a0 does not give traditional owners the right of appeal.\n BHP has said the South Flank project will create around 2,500 construction jobs, more than 600 ongoing operational roles and generate many opportunities for Western Australian suppliers. The project is expected to produce ore for more than 25 years.\n The Western Australian minister for Aboriginal affairs, Ben Wyatt, confirmed he approved the South Flank expansion on 29 May, three days after the destruction of Juukan Gorge made global headlines.\n But he has urged BHP to cooperate with the Banjima under what are now \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d.\n \u201cAs with any agreement, some circumstances can change including the understanding of heritage values of particular sites.\n \u201cI urge parties to such agreements to cooperate on management of those changed circumstances.\n \u201cI have asked BHP to work with Banjima to do what it can to avoid or minimise the impact on this site, regardless of the section 18 approval.\u201d\n Wyatt said impending reforms to the WA Aboriginal heritage legislation will end the section 18 process and reinforce the need for land users to negotiate directly with traditional owners.\n Wyatt said he wants to see impacts to Aboriginal sites \u201climited to the practical extent possible\u201d but that he is \u201ccautious about governments interfering in private negotiations by registered native title holders\u201d.\n Companies such as BHP make significant investment decisions on the basis of these agreements with native title groups, which in turn generate substantial benefits, he said.\n \u201cOur first principle is to seek to avoid impacts to cultural heritage, through planning and ongoing consultation with traditional owners. This approach is supported by the individual land use agreements we establish in partnership with traditional owners, and is in addition to meeting the requirements of Aboriginal heritage protection laws\u201d a BHP spokesman said.", "posttime": "2020-06-11 11:08:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u571f\u8457,bhp", "title":

"note_en": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014\u00a0Nearly three months after Louisville Metro Police officers fatally shot\u00a0Breonna Taylor\u00a0in her apartment, the department  has released the incident report\u00a0from that night.\n  The four-page report lists the time, date, case number, incident location and the victim&#39;s name\u00a0\u2014 Breonna Shaquille Taylor\u00a0\u2014 as well as the fact that she is a 26-year-old\u00a0black female.\n The report redacts Taylor&#39;s street number, apartment number and date of birth\u00a0\u2014 all of which have been widely reported already.\n And it lists as her injuries, &#34;none,&#34; even though\u00a0she was shot at least eight times\u00a0and died on her hallway floor in a pool of blood, according to attorneys for her family.\n It lists the charges as &#34;death investigation\u00a0\u2014 LMPD involved&#34; but checks the &#34;no&#34; box under &#34;forced entry,&#34; even though officers used a battering ram to knock in Taylor&#39;s apartment door.\n    It also lists under the &#34;Offenders&#34; portion of the report the\u00a0three officers who fired in Taylor&#39;s apartment, fatally shooting her \u2014 Sgt. Jon Mattingly, 47; Myles Cosgrove, 42; and Brett Hankison, 44.\n The\u00a0&#34;narrative&#34; of events March 13 says only &#34;PIU investigation.&#34; And the rest of the report has no information filled in at all.\n  Taylor was at her apartment around 12:40 a.m. local time when the three plainclothes officers used a no-knock search warrant signed by District Judge Mary Shaw\u00a0to enter her home as part of a narcotics investigation.\n Officers say they announced their presence, but Taylor&#39;s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, and several neighbors say they did not. Walker has said he thought intruders were trying to break in\u00a0and fired a warning shot that struck Mattingly in the leg.\n  Mattingly, Hankison and Cosgrove are\u00a0on administrative reassignment pending the investigation. The detective who requested the warrant, Joshua Jaynes,\u00a0has also been reassigned, LMPD announced Wednesday.\n \u201cThis document is proof that LMPD continues to make a mockery of transparency,\u201d said Jon Fleischaker, counsel for the Louisville Courier Journal of the USA TODAY Network\u00a0and one of the principal authors of the state\u2019s Open Records law that requires the release of public documents in all but extremely rare circumstances.\n  \u201cUnder the Fischer administration, there has been a consistent policy and practice of refusing to tell the public what is going on with the police, regardless of how inappropriate the officer conduct has been,&#34; Fleischaker said.\n  With debate about police reform taking place nationwide, Fleischaker said city leaders\u00a0&#34;are refusing to honor their obligations to disclose the basic information necessary for the citizens of Louisville to have a meaningful debate about what needs to change.&#34;\n  &#34;How can we even seriously debate police reform if the police won\u2019t engage and the mayor won\u2019t stand up to them?&#34; he said.\n The Courier Journal is suing LMPD,\u00a0seeking the immediate release of the department&#39;s investigative file\u00a0in\u00a0Taylor&#39;s shooting.\n  The Courier Journal also filed an appeal with the state attorney general\u2019s office in May to object to open-records decisions Louisville public agencies made refusing to release records underlying the Taylor case, including the incident report, 911 calls made in the incident and Taylor&#39;s autopsy report.\n The city has since released Walker&#39;s 911 call\u00a0\u2014 but only after\u00a0an attorney for Taylor&#39;s family gave it to news media\u00a0hours earlier.", "posttime":

"note_en": "We are pleased to announce the technology preview of QUIC+HTTP/3 for NGINX at a  special open source repository. This is pre\u2011release software, based on the  IETF QUIC draft and is maintained in a development branch, isolated from the stable and mainline branches. The release is the culmination of several months of initial development, and is now ready for interoperability testing, feedback, and code contributions.\n   In this fast\u2011paced world, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been a remarkably stable constant for over two decades. The  HTTP/1.1 standard was published in\u00a01999 and has become the ubiquitous transport protocol for web applications and APIs. The protocol remained the same over the next\u00a021 years despite the huge changes to the apps and services it is used to transport.\n At this point the astute reader may be asking, \u201cbut what about HTTP/2?\u201d. This is a very good question. The  HTTP/2 standard was published in\u00a02015, and has seen steady adoption to the point where\u00a0 45% of Internet\u2011facing websites support HTTP/2. However, this statistic belies the reality that the use of HTTP is quite different on the public Internet compared to the \u201c last mile\u201d (the runtime infrastructure).\n The reality of modern Internet infrastructure is that HTTP/2 is very rarely deployed end to end. It is designed to solve problems that manifest most clearly on the public Internet, where latency is unpredictably high and  problems with one HTTP request can delay subsequent requests. Inside the application runtime environment\u00a0\u2013 for example, a public cloud or private data center\u00a0\u2013 latency is low, network reliability is excellent, and the ability to directly inspect HTTP/1.1\u2019s text\u2011based transport stream is of more value than the efficiency of HTTP/2\u2019s binary transport stream.\n HTTP/2 has by and large improved the user experience on browsers and mobile devices, because it\u2019s well suited to the environment between the client and the \u201cedge\u201d of the runtime infrastructure. At that point it is typically proxied into a runtime environment where HTTP/1.1 is used. The edge is most likely to be a CDN provider, or a reverse\u2011proxy load balancer that handles traffic entering the runtime environment.\n  This hybrid approach of using HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 to deliver websites and applications works well. So why propose yet another new protocol, HTTP/3?\n The primary innovation of HTTP/2 is to multiplex several HTTP requests over a single connection that uses TCP as the low level transport. Unfortunately, TCP has inherent limitations that constrain the performance and user experience of website and applications. The  TCP standard was originally published in\u00a01981 and has been astonishingly successful as a general\u2011purpose transport protocol. However, when you multiplex several independent requests over the same connection, they all become subject to the reliability of that connection. If a packet for just one request is lost, all of the multiplexed requests are delayed until the lost packet is first detected and then retransmitted.\n HTTP/3 is based on the  QUIC transport protocol, which is designed specifically to support multiplexed connections without depending on a single TCP connection. QUIC instead uses  UDP as the low\u2011level transport mechanism for moving packets between client and server, and implements a reliable connection upon which HTTP requests are made. Notably, QUIC also incorporates TLS as an integral component, not as an additional layer as with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.\n  The goal of QUIC is to provide a high\u2011performance, high\u2011reliability, high\u2011security transport protocol for HTTP/3 (although QUIC is also suitable for non\u2011HTTP traffic). Semantically speaking, HTTP/3 itself is very similar to HTTP/2. However there is no explicit versioning of HTTP\u00a0\u2013  https://www.example.com might support one or more of HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3. How do clients (web browsers) know which version of HTTP to use?\n The versioning issue first arose with the introduction of HTTP/2, which solved it by using the TLS handshake to detect whether the client and server are capable of communicating over HTTP/2. That way, the client knows how to talk to the server before the connection is even established. However, QUIC\u2019s use of UDP instead of TCP as the underlying transport protocol presents a new challenge\u00a0\u2013 how does the client know which type of connection to request initially, TCP or UDP? The solution is for the client to establish a TCP connection for the initial HTTP request. The response from a server that supports HTTP/3 includes the   Alt-Svc  header to specify the UDP port on which it is listening for HTTP/3 traffic. In addition, the browser remembers which sites support QUIC to eliminate the overhead of the   Alt-Svc\u2013based discovery method.\n  Today we announce the initial release of the official QUIC and HTTP/3 implementation for NGINX, the http_v3_module. This is a technology preview and must be considered experimental\u00a0\u2013 it is not for production use. At the time of writing, the  QUIC standard is not yet finalized, and this initial release is implemented against a subset of the current draft.\n Following several months of design and development, the http_v3_module is ready for interoperability testing. We also welcome general feedback and code contributions. Note that the http_v3_module is not available in the mainline development branch; because it is still experimental, it is in a dedicated development branch at   https://hg.nginx.org/nginx-quic.\n Note that this QUIC+HTTP/3 implementation is all\u2011new, and not related to the patch provided by Cloudflare as part of its  quiche project.\n  server {\r listen 443 ssl; # TCP listener for HTTP/1.1\r listen 443 http3 reuseport; # UDP listener for QUIC+HTTP/3\r\r ssl_protocols TLSv1.3; # QUIC requires TLS 1.3\r ssl_certificate ssl/www.example.com.crt;\r ssl_certificate_key ssl/www.example.com.key;\r\r add_header Alt-Svc &#39;quic=&#34;:443&#34;&#39;; # Advertise that QUIC is available\r add_header QUIC-Status $quic; # Sent when QUIC was used\r}\n For more information about building NGINX from the   nginx-quic repo, and recommended configuration, see the  README. In addition, a demo site with the http_v3_module enabled is available at  https://quic.nginx.org/. From here you can check whether your browser already supports QUIC, and compare HTTP/3 interoperability with your own build of   nginx-quic. Given the draft status of QUIC, you may need to use development versions or the very latest builds of the common browsers to enable a QUIC connection.\n Thanks for trying   nginx-quic, and we look forward to hearing your feedback in the comments section, or on our  mailing lists.", "posttime": "2020-06-11 10:50:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Introduced for 1911 and continued in production through at least  1916-1917\u00a0is what I consider to be one of the best and simplest fans of the period, the Robbins &amp; Myers &#34;List 1404&#34; model 14, three versions of which are shown in the photo above. \u00a0A similar 16&#34; fan was also made, the List 1411 and 14110 which, other than the fan size, was basically the same as the 12&#34; model.\n  Left to right are the original 1911 model (one of my favorite fans and often a daily user) with a guard using a square back ring. \u00a0This is the same cage used on later production versions of the R&amp;M &#34;lollipop&#34; fan. \u00a0An early lollipop fan is shown below. \u00a0For 1912 the guard of the 1404 was changed to a two ring cage using a round wire back ring and the same common flag cage badge that R&amp;M had already been using for a few years. \u00a0For the final few years of the 1404 the List No. became 14040 and was, basically, the same fan as the 1404 but with a felt covered base plate. \u00a0The last year of production was actually  after R&amp;M introduced their new drawn steel fan motors for 1916 and appears to have had a cage with the new, smaller solid cage badge as shown on the right of the photo above. \u00a0\u00a0The fan on the right has its original felt on the base. \u00a0All three fans have their original paint, finish on the brass, and head wires.\n  Was the 14040 continued in production for a year or more after the stamped steel motor modles came out or am I seeing the result of some cage substitutions? \u00a0I have found some new information from the Toronto, Canada  The\u00a0Electrical News, below, that shows the old cast iron R&amp;M fans were sold alongside the new 1916 stamped steel models. \u00a0This would account for the small round badge on the latest List 1404 models. \u00a0It appears that the 12&#34; and 16&#34; fans for 1916, both the old cast iron models and new stamped steel models, used the old flag badge while only the smaller (stamped steel) fans used the new round solid cage badge. \u00a01917 models, both iron and steel had the newer round cage badge and a brass cage. \u00a0 For 1918 and possibly 1919 R&amp;M&#39;s larger fans had a wrapped steel cage followed by a welded steel cage c.1920.\n     One can closely, if not exactly, date the List 1404 and 14040 models as follows:\n      Robbins &amp; Myers was one of the oldest fan companies, having begun the manufacture of direct current ceiling fans in 1897 in Springfield, Ohio under the ownership of Chandler Robbins and James Myers. \u00a0Direct current desk fans were added in 1899. \u00a0After acquiring a patent from Charles Eck for an oscillating fan mechanism, R&amp;M put into production their unique DC &#34;lollipop&#34; oscillator in 1904, followed a few years later by an AC version. \u00a0A sheet brass disk in front of the fan was acted upon by the air from the fan causing the fan to oscillate back and forth. \u00a0Stops on the base of the fan were contacted by a pin at the bottom of the lollipop shaft to shift the disc to the other side, resulting in the fan oscillating to the other side.\n    R&amp;M had been making only direct current fans until 1908 when their first AC fans were introduced. \u00a0Their new 12&#34; and 16&#34; AC fans were made by Westinghouse and re-badged for R&amp;M. \u00a0They were virtually identical to the Westinghouse &#34;tank&#34; fans but with the R&amp;M open flag cage badge. \u00a0With Westinghouse&#39;s impending introduction of a new drawn steel fan motor in 1912 it is likely that R&amp;M found it would no longer have a source of AC fan motors, prompting them to design their own AC fan motor, the &#34;List 1404&#34; and varients.\n  The 1404 did away with the mechanical start switch of the previous R&amp;M AC fans made by Westinghouse. \u00a0The 1404 incorporated three speeds with a good speed separation between high and medium and medium and low. \u00a0They also run pretty quietly and are an easy fan to live with for daily use.\n       The much more commonly used &#34;open flag&#34; cage badge as used on most 1404 and 14040 fans is shown in the top photo, right, and was used on 12&#34; and 16&#34; R&amp;M fans through 1916. \u00a0The photo below, right, is of the smaller round badge used during the last year of R&amp;M cast iron fan motor production, presumably 1917. \u00a0 I have both the 12&#34;\u00a0R&amp;M 14040 and a 16&#34; R&amp;M 11530 oscillator\u00a0with the round cage badge.                    Robbins &amp; Myers motor tags from the 1911-1917 era have little information on them; the &#34;List No.&#34; (the first two digits are the &#34;model number&#34;) and the voltage and frequency, as well as direct or alternating current. \u00a0That is all you got- no serial numbers or patent dates or other information was included. \u00a0If there were patents pending they never were on the motor tags of these fans as an actual date.         Yes, R&amp;M did make Direct Current versions of the 1404 and 14040. \u00a0Above is the motor tag of a later version of the List 1505 with felt base plate making it a List 15050. \u00a0Note the 30 volts on the tag. \u00a0A standard 110 v. DC version is a List 1500, or List 15000 with the felt base.  Most information for R&amp;M fans is hard to come by. \u00a0I have not seen any catalogs of their earlier fans so that I might see what voltages and frequencies they made fans for or the other models that were made in this series of the Models 14 and 15.   Right: \u00a0The 1911 1404 on the left in the photo and the c.1915 14040 on the right. \u00a0Not too many fan makers pin striped their fans but R&amp;M was one who did well into the 1920s. \u00a0Usually a pair of double stripes was used, hand applied, around both the motor and the base. \u00a0A single stripe was applied to the sides of the trunnion. \u00a0 R&amp;M&#39;s finish was second to none in this period and their black japan finish was very durable. \u00a0It can usually be cleaned up using acetone and a rag and Q-tips with no harm to the japan. \u00a0That finish is really tough!  Click on photos in the blog to see a larger version.     There are two wing bolts on these fans. \u00a0Here you can see them both painted black; one for the tilt adjustment on the left upper side of the trunnion and a smaller wing bolt, also painted black on this fan, at the bottom center of the trunnion to adjust for side to side position of the fan. The tilt adjustment must be the easiest to use and most secure locking of any fan ever made. \u00a0A wonderful design of a simple part.\n  What is unusual to me is that a brass wing bolt should indicate that the bolt is made of brass and, one would think, a black painted wing bolt would indicate an iron wing bolt. \u00a0Also, one would think that brass is earlier and iron is later. \u00a0The 1911 model has both wing bolts of lacquered brass. \u00a0On the newest fan discussed here, the one with the small, solid cage badge, the large wing bolt is steel but the small one is brass, painted black. \u00a0The fan in the center of the first photo and the DC fan both have a brass large bolt but a black steel small bolt. \u00a0Such minor details are not uncommon for old fans. \u00a0The companies probably used what they had on hand.\n      Rear bearing caps or covers were never used on these fans. \u00a0On the earlier models without the felt base plate a tan fiber cover was screwed to the base which helped to protect the switch and wiring. \u00a0Three rubber feet protected the surface the fan was placed on.\n    Below are comparison photos of the early (1911) cage with square back ring and the later cages with the two round rings. \u00a0The double ring cages only differed among the years used (1912- 1917) by having the smaller solid badge on the  1917 cages.\n         Cage struts and clips as shown to the right\u00a0were made of stamped steel in all years and did not differ. \u00a0Attaching screws were solid brass.\n Blades were highly polished and lacquered. \u00a0Cages and other brass parts were probably dipped and lacquered and not highly polished as is commonly seen on modern restorations. \u00a0I have never figured out what the &#34;dipped&#34; part of dipped and lacquered is but will often see that term used in fan catalogs of the period.\n     Some photos, below, of the 30 volt Direct Current, List 15050 fan. \u00a0After some cleaning of the commutator and brushes and lubricating the oil cups, this fan runs very well. \u00a0I connect the power cord to my variac to reduce the voltage to 30 volts or less and plug it into a power strip socket in which I have installed a bridge rectifier which gives a close approximation of direct current voltage. \u00a0The bridge rectifiers are small, about $4 each, and are easy to hook up. \u00a0They can be installed inside the base of most early fans if there is room in the base and the fan can then be plugged into a regular house wall outlet.\n    While the base of the DC models is the same (the switch is not the same) the motor is larger in diameter and deeper, with different construction. \u00a0 I would say the DC has a better looking motor than the AC versions. \u00a0The tubes sticking out from the rear sides of the motor are the brush holders. \u00a0Earlier versions differ somewhat in having a screw-on knurled cap.   There were no typical two prong plugs as we know them today until about 1917. \u00a0Instead fans and other electrical appliances used &#34;attachment plugs&#34; as shown below allowing the fan to be connected to a light socket. \u00a0In the nineteen teens wall outlets began to be installed in buildings but the attachment plugs persisted into the 1930s, by then separable from a standard two prong plug.          Venting on the DC fan motors is very different from the AC motors. \u00a0A few large openings on the DC motors contrast with many smaller vent holes on the AC motors.  Oil cups are made of brass and have spring loaded felt wicks in them to wick oil to the bearings. \u00a020 wt. non-detergent is the proper oil to use on old fans.      What about rarity and availability of these R&amp;M fans? \u00a0I would say they are a bit uncommon but not too hard to find. \u00a0 Certainly they are much less common than even the 1902-07 GE pancakes, or the GE &#34;Big Motor Yoke&#34; and &#34;Small Motor Yoke&#34; \u00a0models of about the same period. \u00a0DC models are fairly rare and hard to find which makes sense since Direct Current power disappeard for the most part from our country fairly early. \u00a0I bet a lot of DC fans met their fate in the scrap drives of the two world wars.\n  Thanks goes to a noted collector of R&amp;M fans for providing me with this scan of an R&amp;M catalog page for the 1911 year List 1404 series of fans. The only numbers I have encountered are the List 1404 and 1411 fans for the common 110 volt 60 cycle current.     What came after the List 1404 and other CAST IRON R&amp;M fans?   Up until 1916 all R&amp;M desk fans were made of cast iron. \u00a0Beginning in 1916 R&amp;M had new designs made of drawn steel, a feature that Westinghouse pioneered for the 1912 model year. \u00a0It appears that the cast iron models were still available for a year or two after 1916 but, predominately, their fans would be of the new pressed steel construction.  The new offerings included a 6&#34; two speed fan with four blades, a three speed 9&#34;, 5 blade fan- Models 26 and 27 (AC and DC), and 12&#34; and 16&#34; 6 blade fans- Model 21 and 22 (AC and DC non-oscillators) as well as oscillating fans, Models 24 and 25 (AC and DC). \u00a0The model numbers were the first two digits of the &#34;List Number&#34; which is the important number in describing R&amp;M fans.  For several years the 12&#34; and 16&#34; fans were available only with 6 blades. \u00a0A brass cage was used on 1916-17 fans with a change to wrapped steel cages for one or two years more before the cages went to welded steel. \u00a0 Before the welded steel cages appeared the four blade fans returned and the 6 blade may have been discontinued. \u00a0As R&amp;M information is hard to come by I will leave it at this for now until I can update the details. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pictured at left is a 1916 R&amp;M 6 wing oscillating Model 24 (List 2404). \u00a0This is probably the last year for the large, open flag cage badge to be used and followed in 1917 by the smaller, solid, round flag cage badge, still on a brass cage and with a 6 wing blade. \u00a0 \u00a0            (To be continued)\u00a0\u00a0I have not yet covered or even mentioned that there are 16&#34; versions of the 1404; the List 1411, 14110, etc. \u00a0The size difference is about the only notable difference although the first year model 1411 (1911) used a square back ring cage but with a front (round) ring that the 12&#34; fan did not use, it had no front ring on the cage.   8-24-16  R&amp;M Flag cage badges- new reproductions: Often the original cage badge is missing from early R&amp;M fans. \u00a0It was a thin stamped sheet brass &#34;flag&#34; as you see pictured in this blog. \u00a0 Fortunately for those who have a missing badge, which is a very common occurrence, AFCA member Darryl Hudson makes excellent die stamped reproductions that are nearly impossible to tell from the originals. \u00a0Darryl made a run of flag badges then ran out. Fortunately he did made another batch around 2014 and I think they are still available. \u00a0If you need a badge don&#39;t dally, they may sell out again and you don&#39;t know if they will be made again. \u00a0Darryl does excellent work. \u00a0He makes the badges in the original thickness of .010 and the same in a thicker and slightly more durable 0.015&#34; thickness for the same price of $40.00 each plus shipping. \u00a0 That&#39;s a bargain for the quality and intricateness of his badges.

a doctor blamed the technology for a problem with his vision.\n Glasses should correct the issue but would normally only &#34;be prescribed to 40-year-olds&#34;, he tweeted.\n The Association of Optometrists said it had not seen evidence that VR headsets could cause permanent eye damage.\n Facebook-owned Oculus states in its handbook that one in 4,000 may suffer &#34;dizziness, seizures, eye or muscle twitching.&#34; It recommends users suffering these symptoms discontinue using the headset and see a doctor.\n  Doctors have previously warned that virtual reality, which is the computer-generated simulation of a real or imaginary environment, can cause eye strain because the brain is forced to process visual stimuli in a different way to normal.\n And users have complained about nausea and dizziness when using headsets, which is generally put down the the way a user perceives space around them, leading to motion sickness.\n Danny Bittman, who has worked as a virtual reality developer for four years, suggested it could have affected his eyesight.\n &#34;Just had my first eye doctor visit in three years. Now I&#39;m very worried about my future VR use. I have a new eye convergence problem that acts like dyslexia. The doc, a headset owner, is convinced my VR use caused this. He said &#34;these glasses we usually prescribe to 40-year-olds&#34;, he tweeted.\n  He went on to describe the problem: &#34;My eyes jump when I read things like a screen or books. I&#39;ve always had a small level of this but it&#39;s greatly intensified now. It&#39;s also linked to headaches and vertigo.&#34;\n He said that the issue was about &#34;prolonged use&#34;, and admitted that he could spend up to six hours a day wearing a headset, split into 30-minute sessions.\n Ceri Smith-Jaynes, from the Association of Optometrists, told the BBC: &#34;We currently do not have any reliable evidence that VR headsets cause permanent deterioration in eyesight in children or adults. There have been some studies looking into the effects of short-term use of VR headsets only; these did not reveal a deterioration in eyesight.\n &#34;However, some people do suffer from temporary symptoms such as nausea, dry, irritable eyes, headache or eyestrain. &#34;\n But she did have some advice about usage: &#34;If you spend all day in VR without a break, you&#39;ll need time to readjust to the light and the different visual environment of the real world. I would suggest taking a five-to-ten minute break each hour, using that time to move about, blink and look out of a window, or take a short walk.\n &#34;The number of hours of headset use a person can comfortably tolerate will vary depending on your binocular vision status (ask your optometrist) and the task you are doing in VR.&#34;\n VR headsets have been adapted to help improve eyesight. Start-up GiveVision created a device called SightPlus, that aims to restore vision to people whose eyesight has deteriorated beyond repair by projecting a video of the real world into the working part of the retina.\n A clinical trial at Moorfields Eye Hospital suggested it improved eyesight in 59 of the 60 participants, with nearly half saying they would wear the device for watching TV, reading or going to the theatre. The firm is partnering with Sony to develop its next device.", "posttime": "2020-06-11 10:17:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

with family in a simple board game at home, rolling the dice introduces a bit of chance or &#34;luck&#34; into every game. We expect dice to be fair, where every number has equal probability of being rolled.\n    But a new study shows this was not always the case. In Roman times, many dice were visibly lopsided, unlike today&#39;s perfect cubes. And in early medieval times, dice were often &#34;unbalanced&#34; in the arrangement of numbers, where 1 appears opposite 2, 3 opposite 4, and 5 opposite 6. It did not matter what the objects were made of (metal, clay, bone, antler and ivory), or whether they were precisely symmetrical or consistent in size or shape, because, like the weather, rolls were predetermined by gods or other supernatural elements.\n  All that began to change around 1450, when dice makers and players seemingly figured out that form affected function, explained Jelmer Eerkens, University of California, Davis, professor of anthropology and the lead author of a recent study on dice.\n &#34;A new worldview was emerging -- the Renaissance. People like Galileo and Blaise Pascal were developing ideas about chance and probability, and we know from written records in some cases they were actually consulting with gamblers,&#34; he said. &#34;We think users of dice also adopted new ideas about fairness, and chance or probability in games.&#34;\n  &#34;Standardizing the attributes of a die, like symmetry and the arrangement of numbers, may have been one method to decrease the likelihood that an unscrupulous player had manipulated the dice to change the odds of a particular roll,&#34; Eerkens said.\n     Dice are not common finds in archaeological sites. They are typically found in garbage, domestic areas, or cemeteries, and frequently are recovered as lone objects in a site, Eerkens said. Many are not accurately dated.\n After looking at hundreds of dice in dozens of museums and archaeological depots across the Netherlands, Eerkens and his co-author, Alex de Voogt, of the American Museum of Natural History, New York, were able to assemble and analyze a set of 110 carefully dated, cube-shaped dice. Their findings were published in the journal  Acta Archaeologica in December.\n  -- Dice made before 400, or in Roman times, are highly variable in shape, size, material and configuration of numbers.    -- When dice reappear around 1100 they are predominantly in the &#34;primes&#34; configuration, where opposite numbers tally to prime numbers (1-2; 3-4; 5-6), a numbering style that was also popular in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt. Early medieval dice also tend to be quite small relative to their Roman predecessors.\n     -- Around 1450 the numbering system quickly changed to &#34;sevens&#34; where opposite sides add up to seven (6-1; 5-2; 3-4). Dice also became highly standardized in shape, and also were made larger again. Standardization may be, in part, a byproduct of mass production.\n Eerkens said he studied dice because they are a convenient item in which to isolate the function from the style, as opposed to other artifacts found in archaeological sites, such as arrowheads, a functional item used for hunting. &#34;A lot of artifacts we study as archaeologists conflate the two... . We know for dice they are purely stylistic.&#34;\n The study also shows that dice, like many material objects, reflect a lot about people&#39;s changing worldviews, Eerkens said.\n  The researchers conclude in their article, &#34;Gamblers may have seen dice throws as no longer determined by fate, but instead as randomizing objects governed by chance.&#34;\n    Materials provided by   University of California - Davis.

I will no longer be following my earlier model of posting. I will write what comes to me during these difficult times. If you like any of my past writings and want to help keep this project going, please subscribe below or become a patron at  patreon.com/ForwardBlog\n   The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) will most likely be a short lived communal project of local socialists and anarchists in Seattle. But it\u2019s fascinating lesson in how to build communal societies and what benefits they can provide to a large group of people. After a week of tough protesting against the Seattle PD, local anarchists began to create roadblocks in and around the Capitol Hill area of Seattle once the department retreated from their East Precinct. CHAZ was established only after the Seattle PD abandoned that precinct. Capitol Hill is a posh, LGBTQ community where a lot of younger urban professionals already lived. On June 8th, they officially declared a six block radius under their complete control and gave it a new name, The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), aka \u201cFree Capitol Hill.\u201d Anarchists used the moniker \u201cFree Capitol Hill\u201d in homage to the \u201cFree Derry\u201d sign erected in the Bogside neighborhood of the Northern Ireland city of Derry, which became an embattled city during the Troubles. These developments are amazing when you consider that in just two weeks, three different police precincts were either abandoned or burned down (2 in Minneapolis, 1 in Seattle). We\u2019ve never seen this before in America and it does signal what can be possible through numbers and sheer determination. Now, obviously the goal is not to take over police stations, but to defund departments and attempt to rebuild policing from the ground up. Some may toe the line of \u201creform\u201d but anarchists and socialists in this country know that much more than that is needed. CHAZ is a local experiment, but one worth taking lessons from and it\u2019s a breath of fresh air during a time of inhumanity.\n      On June 7, the mayor of Seattle, Jenny Durkan announced that no more tear gas can be used and only de-escalation techniques going forward. That night and the night of June 8th, her department decided to use tear gas anyway because like most mayors in the country, they have no control of their brutish and unaccountable police departments. Video surfaced late on the night of June 8th of tear gas filling an entire street in the Capitol Hill district. This video went viral, but what didn\u2019t go viral was the Seattle PD\u2019s tactical retreat that happened later in the night and the subsequent complete control that was gained in the district by local anarchists and socialists. By the morning of June 9th, that six block radius was in their complete control. Roadblocks were erected, signs were put up and artists came in to put their stamp on the community. As far as internal governance goes, there is none of course. It\u2019s an experiment in de-centralized governance operating as a  de facto anarchist region. It\u2019s probably most similar to Freetown Christiania which is an intentional commune in the borough of Christianshavn in the city of Copenhagen, Denmark.\n      Tents have been pitched next to the abandoned police station and local medics, artists, civil servants and restauranteurs have flooded the zone in order to provide their services. It\u2019s estimated that about 200 residents are currently occupying CHAZ and have come from all over the city of Seattle. On June 9th, they established the \u201cNo Cop Co-op\u201d, which hands out free water, hand sanitizer, snacks, masks and kebabs. An intersection was cordoned off to provide \u201cteach-ins\u201d which are basically soapbox lectures on how to run a co-op and how to build effective communes. Other speakers educate people on police brutality and protesting tactics moving forward. A large screen outdoor cinema was set up with a large projector and portable toilets were donated from the Seattle Transportation Department. Additionally, homemade riot shields are being made and distributed to everyone in the commune. Going forward, local zoners also hope to build a cohesive labor movement that can spread across the Northwest. National  organizations like CODEPINK support the commune stating \u201cpolice are the real instigators.\u201d Local activists in CHAZ have decided to use a pink umbrella as their symbol to show solidarity with those in Hong Kong whose techniques have been copied by protestors all over the world. As mentioned earlier, street medics have flooded the zone and play a major role. Many of them are college educated and have experience being in the field during protests. They also have created medic tents in order to deal with the future conflicts that they will surely have with the police.\n      On June 9th, CHAZ representatives  released a list of demands that were authored by many of the collective voices in the zone. Most of them are extremely realistic and can be accomplished if Seattle actually had a representative government instead of one that works for Amazon. The list of demands falls under four categories: economics, education, the justice system and health and human services. The authors stated further that the zone was on land taken from the local Native American Duwamish people over a century ago. The Pacific Northwest has a long history with native tribes and the collective voices of the zone realize that. Additionally, they have requested no violence be used in attempts to remove the zoners and that they be allowed to operate in a communal structure in order to \u201cshow the country what is possible through collective voices.\u201d CHAZ has been praised by the IWW\u2019s  Industrial Worker publication as an effective way to distribute badly needed social services. The irony behind the creation of CHAZ is that austerity measures have been put in many American cities since the CARES bailout back in March. This is expected during crises and it\u2019s not acceptable to those not just in CHAZ but protesting within the BLM movement. Austerity has been a prime focus during these protests because while police departments across the country see their budgets increase every year, every other line item of public services continue to be cut. Anarchists in the zone realize they need to do more planning going forward. They have already began deputizing scouts and are working on expanding their perimeter even more. Smoking areas have been designated and local marijuana growers have flooded the zone to provide free marijuana. The anti-capitalist views of the inhabitants will create an atmosphere of brainstorming that will only serve the commune for the better going forward. As an example of this, many have began talking about black-owned banks, divesting from local corporations and prison reform. Local activists even gave a soapbox speech  criticizing the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), and how their representatives in conservative state legislatures write laws without \u201cany clue\u201d as to who they represent. The opportunity is there to create a flourishing commune in a short term project that will ultimately likely be destroyed at some point. The main goal is to provide a glimpse for Americans what can be possible though communal action when you operate outside of the system of government that many Americans take for granted. This is not a country that is used to communal action and most citizens probably don\u2019t even know the definition of a co-op. Kshama Sawant is a Seattle City Council member and member of the Trotskyist Socialist Alternative Party (SA). She visited the zone on June 9th and asked the residents to turn it into a community center for restorative justice. She agreed that there needs to be long term goals and that the method of going beyond policing (police abolition) needs to be analyzed and discoursed in the mainstream. Sawant did suggest caution though on pushing the city too far. She, along with the residents want to avoid future violence if the police do eventually move in to tear down the commune. The development of CHAZ is a real time education in community organizing and anarchist alternatives. Amazon and Boeing weren\u2019t going to provide the people of Seattle with basic life necessities. Those in CHAZ hope they can demonstrate that social services can be provided in a vacuum. They have stated they will continue to build the commune and will continue until they are forced out. Long live the commune!", "posttime": "2020-06-11 10:16:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6765\u5230,hill,\u897f\u96c5\u56fe", "title": "\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230\u56fd\u4f1a\u5c71\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a(CHAZ)", "title_en": "Welcome to the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://forwardblog.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-capitol-hill-autonomous?r=5iwv9&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=hackernews", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6765\u5230", "hill", "\u897f\u96c5\u56fe"]}]
