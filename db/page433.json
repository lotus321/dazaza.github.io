So I thought, \u201cwhy not find as many best practices as I can and write about those?\u201d\n        The interfaces you use daily are designed to be fairly frictionless. Clean, spacious, minimal. They help you send texts, stream videos, and mindlessly scroll through your newsfeeds.\n       They\u2019re made for performance, favoring function over form. They enable you to analyze business expenses, track logistics, and monitor key metrics.\n         Your users (most likely executives, managers, and analysts) will need specific information from complex data in order to do their jobs.\n           And get rid of redundant data. Often, the same data is shown but in multiple variations.\n Combine elements where it makes sense. For example, turning first and last name fields into a single \u201cname\u201d field.\n   Another way to reduce the data shown to the user is to  shape the page.\n          Starting this way will help you think through the relationships in the data and stick to solving your user&#39;s problems.\n     \ud83d\udccc  Basecamp wrote a very opinionated  blog post on why you only need these three kinds of charts.\n \ud83d\udd28 A great tool for visualizing data is  Tableau \u2014but it\u2019s uber expensive.\n \ud83d\udcda A great book on visualizing data is  \u201cThe Wall Street Journal: Guide to information Graphics\u201d by Dona Wong \u2014which is  not uber expensive.\n   That don\u2019t simply mean font types. Font weight,  kerning, and spacing impact a user\u2019s ability to quickly read and interpret data from an interface.\n        Use a conservative color palette. Save eye-catching colors for important data \u2014like error messages (usually red), key metrics, or link text.\n   \ud83d\udccc If you still want more info on choosing the right color palettes to visualize data, I recommend  this article by Invision.\n    Keep \u201cfurniture\u201d to a minimum (ie rules, boxes, dots, and other visual guide-rails)\n   When increasing density in your interface, think about which elements are essential and which are more for aesthetic.\n   Increased density means more content on-screen. When working with lists, tables, and long forms added density makes information easier to scan, view and compare.\n      Don\u2019t increase density on components that alert users of changes, such as  snackbars or dialogs. Increasing the density of alerts makes them less readable and less effective at attracting user attention.\n Similarly, don\u2019t increase density of components that involve focused tasks, such as dropdown menus and date pickers. The increased density reduces usability by limiting tappable space.\n     When dealing with large data sets, it may be best to allow users to export that data to another tool where they can interact with it better.\n Give your users the ability to export the data they\u2019re looking at via XML, XLS, JSON, or CSV.\n One cool thing you can also do is display as much data as you can and if the user wants to see more data then they can export the data you display  plus more data that you couldn\u2019t fit into the screen.\n   Unless you\u2019ve completely ruled out touch-based interactions from your interface, don\u2019t forget the minimum sizes for touch targets.\n   \ud83d\udccc Google\u2019s Material Design docs has good guidelines on touch targets that you can find  here.\n \ud83d\udccc They\u2019ve also laid out new design standards for increased density in enterprise apps. They have great tips and practical examples on how density affects your interface. You can read more about that  here.\n  One way to turn seemingly  useless data into  useful data is to use text to communicate exactly what the user wants to know.\n COVID-19 trackers are a good example. With these in particular, you want to prioritize  actionable data over  volume of data.\n        Ask yourself, \u201c Is this important for the user to get their job done?\u201d\n        \ud83d\udccc I used many resources to put this issue together but the two most useful ones were:\n    \ud83d\udc26 I hope you enjoyed this issue. If you could show some love to this tweet thread, I\u2019d really appreciate it.\n  \ud83d\udc4b Also, come say hello in the  Telegram group chat. I call it \u201cProduct Peeps.\u201d\n    PS. I just realized I\u2019m releasing issue #20 on the last day I\u2019ll ever 20 years old (\ud83e\udd2f). Also, not expecting b-day wishes but, uh, you can if you want (\ud83d\ude09).", "posttime": "2020-05-03 20:47:21", "tags": "\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b,design,\u6570\u636e,data", "title":

"note_en": "The global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has seen a deluge of clinical studies, with hundreds registered on [clinicaltrials.gov][1]. But a palpable sense of urgency and a lingering concern that \u201cin critical situations, large randomized controlled trials are not always feasible or ethical\u201d ([ 1 ][2]) perpetuate the perception that, when it comes to the rigors of science, crisis situations demand exceptions to high standards for quality. Early phase studies have been launched before completion of investigations that would normally be required to warrant further development of the intervention ([ 2 ][3]), and treatment trials have used research strategies that are easy to implement but unlikely to yield unbiased effect estimates. Numerous trials investigating similar hypotheses risk duplication of effort, and droves of research papers have been rushed to preprint servers, essentially outsourcing peer review to practicing physicians and journalists. Although crises present major logistical and practical challenges, the moral mission of research remains the same: to reduce uncertainty and enable caregivers, health systems, and policy-makers to better address individual and public health. Rather than generating permission to carry out low-quality investigations, the urgency and scarcity of pandemics heighten the responsibility of key actors in the research enterprise to coordinate their activities to uphold the standards necessary to advance this mission.Rigorous research practices can't eliminate all uncertainty from medicine, but they represent the most efficient way to clarify the causal relationships clinicians hope to exploit in decisions with momentous consequences for patients and health systems. Nevertheless, fastidious research standards may seem a luxury that pandemics can ill accommodate. Commenting on a study using suboptimal design, one group of scientists stated, \u201cGiven the urgency of the situation, some limitations\u2026may be acceptable, including the small sample size, use of an unvalidated surrogate end point, and lack of randomization or blinding\u201d ([ 1 ][2]). The perception that core methodological components of high-quality research are dispensable is underpinned by three problematic assumptions. The first is that some evidence now, even if flawed, seems preferable to expending greater resources on more-demanding studies whose benefits only materialize later. Because the window for learning in pandemics is often short, the need to \u201cbalance scientific rigor against speed\u201d seems inevitable ([ 3 ][4]).The problem with this view is that challenges that rigorous methods address do not disappear in the face of urgent need. Small studies that build on basic science and preclinical research in early phases of drug development routinely generate signals of promise that are not confirmed in subsequent trials. Even when new drugs are established to be safe and effective, rarely are their benefits so massive that they can be detected in small, open-label, nonrandomized trials. The proliferation of small studies that are not part of an orchestrated trajectory of development is a recipe for generating false leads that threaten to divert already scarce resources toward ineffective practices, slow the uptake of effective interventions because of an inability to reliably detect smaller but clinically meaningful benefits, and engender treatment preferences that make patients and clinicians reluctant to participate in randomized trials. These problems are amplified by published reports of compassionate use, which was designed as an alternative pathway to access interventions outside of research, not to support systematic evaluation.The second underpinning of research exceptionalism is the view that key features of rigorous research, like randomization or placebo comparators, conflict with clinicians' care obligations. However, when studies begin in, and are designed to disturb a state of, clinical equipoise (meaning that it's uncertain whether a particular treatment is better than the alternatives), they ensure that no study participant receives a standard of care known to be inferior to any available alternative ([ 4 ][5]). Under this condition, randomized trials with appropriate comparators configure medical practice in a way that allows patients to access investigational interventions under conditions designed to eliminate ineffective strategies and exploit effective alternatives.The third underpinning of research exceptionalism derives from the expectation that researchers and sponsors are generally free to exercise broad discretion over the organization and design of research. However, that discretion never operates in a vacuum. Even under normal conditions, the goal of research ethics and policy is to use regulations, reporting guidelines, and other social controls to align research conduct with the public interest. Crucially, the information that research produces is a public good on which caregivers, health systems, and policy-makers rely to efficiently discharge important moral responsibilities. As recent international guidelines for ethical research emphasize, the justification for research is its social and scientific value, understood as its ability to produce the information that multiple actors need to make decisions that implicate health, welfare, and the use of scarce resources ([ 5 ][6]).To enable stakeholders to fulfill their social responsibilities, research should embody five conditions of informativeness and social value ([ 6 ][7]). The first is importance. Trials should address key evidence gaps. Interventions selected for testing should capture the most promising therapeutic and prophylactic alternatives as judged from reviews of existing evidence and trials. They should aim to detect effects that are realistic but clinically meaningful. As of this writing, more than 18 clinical trials enrolling more than 75,000 patients have been registered in North America for testing various hydroxychloroquine regimens for COVID-19. This massive commitment concentrates resources on nearly identical clinical hypotheses, creates competition for recruitment, and neglects opportunities to test other clinical hypotheses. Testing different regimens derived from a common clinical hypothesis in uncoordinated protocols increases the probability of false-positive findings due to chance ([ 7 ][8]). This also frustrates cross-comparisons and squanders opportunities to evaluate regimens side by side ([ 8 ][9]).The second component is rigorous design. Trials should be designed to detect clinically meaningful effects so that both positive and negative results serve the informational needs of clinicians and health systems. Studies designed to detect massive effects often eschew randomization or use surrogate end points. Although easily launched, such studies are at high risk for producing inconclusive findings that sow confusion and necessitate further evaluation. The decision to forgo a dummy comparator and use a nonvalidated surrogate end point, absenteeism, in a study testing use of a tuberculosis vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection jeopardizes the study's ability to clarify the merits of this intervention ([ 9 ][10]).The third component is analytical integrity. Designs should be prespecified in protocols, prospectively registered, and analyzed in accordance with prespecification. A recent study of hydroxychloroquine reported a beneficial effect on clinical primary outcomes in a preprint, whereas registration documents revealed a different study design and a polymerase chain reaction\u2013based primary end point. The glaring discrepancy, a well-known source of bias in trials, was not flagged in some reporting on the trial ([ 10 ][11]).Fourth, trials should be reported completely, promptly, and consistently with prespecified analyses. One reporting challenge present in the best of times, and likely to reemerge during pandemics, is the deposition of positive findings in preprint servers earlier than nonpositive studies. Another challenge is quality control. Qualified peer reviewers are a scarce resource, and the proliferation of low-quality papers saps the ability of scientists to place findings into context before they are publicized ([ 11 ][12]). Some recent trials garnering press coverage did not adhere to well-established reporting standards.The fifth component is feasibility: Studies must have a credible prospect of reaching their recruitment target and being completed within a time frame where the evidence is still actionable. This condition is in tension with the others because their resource demands under conditions of scarcity create the prospect that research might never be completed. However, making research feasible by relaxing the other four standards contradicts the social justification for research. The system of incentives normally used to align research actors with the public good is imperfect in noncrisis situations and likely to be ineffective in the context of a pandemic. Therefore, to meet the requirement of feasibility, investigators, sponsors, health systems, and regulators have responsibilities to make exceptional efforts to cooperate and collaborate in a way that concentrates resources on a portfolio of studies that satisfy the above conditions.Sponsors, research consortia, and health agencies should prioritize research approaches that test multiple interventions, foster modularity, and permit timely adaptation ([ 12 ][13]). Master protocols enable multiple interventions to be trialed under a common statistical framework, facilitating cross-comparisons and promoting multicenter collaboration ([ 13 ][14]). Adaptive designs allow flagging interventions to be dropped quickly and promising alternatives to be added with fewer delays than would be incurred from the design and approval of new studies. Seamless trial designs reduce transition time between trial phases and can extend into the provision of care to large numbers of patients.Individual clinicians should avoid off-label use of unvalidated interventions that might interfere with trial recruitment and resist the urge to carry out uncontrolled, open-label studies. They should instead seek out opportunities to join larger, carefully orchestrated protocols to increase the prospect that high-quality studies will be completed quickly and generate the information needed to advance individual and public health. Academic medical centers can facilitate such coordination by surveying the landscape of ongoing studies and establishing mechanisms for \u201cprioritization review\u201d to triage studies ([ 14 ][15]). The goal would be to incentivize participation in efforts that uphold the criteria outlined here and to foster robust participation in multicenter studies so that data can be generated from different institutions before their capacity to meet fastidious research requirements is overwhelmed by surging medical demand.Regulatory agencies and public health authorities should play a leading role in identifying studies that meet these standards and fostering collaboration among a sufficient number of centers to ensure adequate recruitment and timely results. They should also avoid making public recommendations or granting emergency use authorization for interventions whose clinical merits remain to be established and, instead, present clinical trials as a mechanism for addressing uncertainty without compromising patient interests. At public briefings, health authorities can point stakeholders to trials being pursued within their catchment and report recruitment milestones to elevate the profile and progress of high-quality studies.In a report on the ethics and science of research conducted during the 2014\u20132015 Ebola outbreak (during which ethical and practical concerns about using standard research methodologies, like randomization and placebo comparators, yielded a body of inconclusive findings), a U.S. National Academy of Medicine committee argued that clinical research is an integral part of outbreak response and that \u201cdespite [the] sense of urgency, research during an epidemic is still subject to the same core scientific and ethical requirements that govern all research on human subjects\u201d ([ 15 ][16]). One lesson of the current outbreak is that expeditious research in a crisis situation is feasible. Absent robust leadership from regulators, health authorities, and major funding bodies, however, the responsibility for coordinating research activities falls to the wide range of stakeholders who might normally pursue research on a more independent basis. Although many of these parties face powerful, parochial incentives to conduct research that is feasible with the resources that are locally available, the exigencies of crisis situations like global pandemics require exceptional steps to combine efforts, divide labor, and triage out low-value and duplicative research.1.

"note_en": "Limited, indirect evidence from lab studies suggests that homemade fabric masks may capture large respiratory droplets, but there is no evidence they impede the transmission of aerosols implicated in the spread of COVID-19, according to a  paper published yesterday by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\n In the paper, the National Academies&#39; Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats said that, because no studies have been done on the effectiveness of cloth masks in preventing transmission of coronavirus to others, it is impossible to assess their benefits, if any.\n The paper was prepared by committee members Richard Besser, MD, of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Baruch Fischhoff, PhD, of Carnegie Mellon University, and two subject matter experts contributed. It was approved by Committee Chair Harvey Fineberg, MD, PhD, and was peer-reviewed by seven additional US experts.\n In the absence of widespread availability of more effective protection and to preserve surgical masks and respirators for healthcare workers, homemade fabric masks have been proposed to limit spread of coronavirus by wearers who might be contagious but are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently  endorsed their use.\n  Committee members point out that research suggests that COVID-19 can spread via invisible droplets as small as 5 microns and by tiny bioaerosol particles as well as via visible respiratory droplets just by breathing.\n Infected yet asymptomatic people are of particular concern because the particles they breathe are predominantly bioaerosols. &#34;To complicate matters further, different individuals vary in the extent to which they emit bioaerosols while breathing,&#34; they said.\n Because different masks have different filtering capacities and the role of droplet size on disease transmission is unknown, it is difficult to predict the effectiveness of these masks, the authors said. &#34;The extent of any protection will depend on how the masks are made and used,&#34; they wrote. &#34;It will also depend on how mask use affects users&#39; other precautionary behaviors, including their use of better masks, when those become widely available.&#34;\n Those behaviors may reduce or enhance homemade fabric masks&#39; overall effects on public health, they noted. &#34;The current level of benefit, if any, is not possible to assess,&#34; they said.\n Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), who contributed to the paper along with Sundaresan Jayaraman, PhD, of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, said in his weekly CIDRAP  podcast yesterday that, because aerosols likely play an important role in coronavirus transmission, cloth masks will do little, if anything, to limit spread of the disease.\n Even more, he worries that encouraging cloth masks is emboldening people to try to get surgical masks for better protection, taking them away from frontline healthcare workers, who desperately need them. &#34;If we&#39;re right now in a major shortage status\u2014and we will be for the kind of N95 and surgical mask protection\u2014the public should not ever try to get these,&#34; he said.\n   In the report, the committee members called for research to yield clear instructions on how to properly make, fit, use, and clean homemade fabric masks.\n Studies also need to explore estimates of the protection that such masks afford users and others in different settings (eg, in places in which the likelihood of contact is higher, like grocery stores, compared with wearing masks everywhere), they wrote. In addition, they said data need to be gathered on effective reinforcement of other precautions, such as physical (social) distancing.\n &#34;That research could provide policy makers with estimates of the net effect of encouraging use of homemade cloth masks on public health, with realistic estimates of how such masks will be made and used, as well as how they will affect other precautionary behaviors of users and others who observe and interact with them,&#34; they said.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 18:34:46", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u5e03\u9762,cloth,\u53e3\u7f69", "title": "\u4e13\u5bb6\u79f0\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u5e03\u9762\u53e3\u7f69\u6765\u9650\u5236\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "title_en": "Data do not back cloth masks to limit Covid-19, experts say", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/data-do-not-back-cloth-masks-limit-covid-19-experts-say", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u5e03\u9762", "cloth", "\u53e3\u7f69"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c116b596ce7006c7677364ee66bb9c56.jpg", "infoid": 1000471, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u7574\u7406\u8bba--\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u7f16\u7a0b\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u5171\u540c\u4e4b\u5904\uff1f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51fd\u6570\u5f0f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6709\u591a\u4e48\u6709\u7528-\u6216\u8005\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6709\u591a\u4e48\u6df1\u5965\u548c\u9065\u8fdc\u3002\u4e0d\u592a\u4e3a\u4eba\u6240\u77e5\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5c06\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u2026\u2026", "note_en": "Applied Category Theory - The Emerging Science of Compositionality  What do programming, quantum physics, chemistry, neuroscience, systems biology, natural language parsing, causality, network theory, game theory, dynamical systems and database theory have in common?

"note_en": "The man behind the world&#39;s first major computer virus outbreak has admitted his guilt, 20 years after his software infected millions of machines worldwide.\n Filipino Onel de Guzman, now 44, says he unleashed the Love Bug computer worm to steal passwords so he could access the internet without paying.\n   &#34;I didn&#39;t expect it would get to the US and Europe. I was surprised,&#34; he said in an interview for Crime Dot Com, a forthcoming book on cyber-crime.\n   Victims received an email attachment entitled LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU. It contained malicious code that would overwrite files, steal passwords, and automatically send copies of itself to all contacts in the victim&#39;s Microsoft Outlook address book.\n Within 24 hours, it was causing major problems across the globe, reportedly infecting 45 million machines. It also overwhelmed organisations&#39; email systems, and some IT managers disconnected parts of their infrastructure to prevent infection.\n  In the UK, Parliament shut down its email network for several hours to protect itself, and even the Pentagon was reportedly affected.\n The previous year, the Melissa bug is believed to have infected a million machines using similar tactics. However, Love Bug dwarfed previous outbreaks and exposed how vulnerable the world&#39;s increasing internet connectivity was to attack.\n Investigators traced the virus to an email address registered to an apartment in Manila, capital of the Philippines.\n The occupant&#39;s brother was Onel de Guzman, a computer science student at the city&#39;s AMA Computer College. He was a member of an underground hacking group called Grammersoft and quickly became the lead suspect in a police investigation.\n De Guzman&#39;s lawyer organised a press conference on 11 May, at which de Guzman appeared to speak little English.\n When asked whether he may have released the virus accidentally, de Guzman said: &#34;It is possible.&#34;\n  At the time, the Philippines had no law covering computer hacking, and neither de Guzman nor anyone else was ever prosecuted.\n Suspicion also fell on de Guzman&#39;s fellow student Michael Buen, who has been cited online as the co-author of the Love Bug.\n I set out to track down Onel de Guzman and resolve the 20-year mystery of Love Bug&#39;s origin.\n Online rumours claimed de Guzman had moved to Germany, Austria or the US. Some claimed he had been recruited by Microsoft following the outbreak. All proved to be wide of the mark.\n On a forum dedicated to the Philippine underworld, a user claimed in 2016 that de Guzman ran a mobile phone repair shop in the Quiapo district of Manila. In April 2019, I visited the area hoping to encounter the suspect, only to find a sprawling market containing dozens of mobile phone repair shops.\n I wrote Onel de Guzman&#39;s name on a piece of paper and showed it to shop workers at random in the hope that someone would recognise it. Finally an employee said he knew of de Guzman and believed he now worked in another phone repair booth at a shopping mall elsewhere in Manila.\n After several hours wandering around the mall and showing de Guzman&#39;s name, I was directed to a cramped, messy stall at the very back of the building, and after waiting several hours for him to turn up, Onel de Guzman arrived.\n He admitted having created Love Bug, which he said was a revamped version of an earlier virus he had coded in order to steal internet access passwords.\n In the era of dial-up internet, such passwords were needed to get online, and de Guzman says he could not afford to pay for one.\n He claims he initially sent the virus only to Philippine victims, with whom he communicated in chat rooms, because he only wanted to steal internet access passwords that worked in his local area.\n However, in spring 2000 he tweaked the code, adding an auto-spreading feature that would send copies of the virus to victims&#39; Outlook contacts, using a flaw in Microsoft&#39;s Windows 95 operating system. He also created a title for the email attachment that would have global appeal, tempting people across the world to open it.\n &#34;I figured out that many people want a boyfriend, they want each other, they want love, so I called it that,&#34; he said.\n  De Guzman claims he sent the virus initially to someone in Singapore, and then went out drinking with a friend. The first he knew of the global chaos he had unleashed was when his mother told him police were hunting a hacker in Manila.\n He explained that his mother hid his computer equipment. De Guzman insists Buen had nothing to do with Love Bug and that he was its sole creator.\n After a period of lying low, de Guzman returned to computer work but did not go back to college. He now runs the small booth with another member of staff.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 18:12:46", "tags": "\u521b\u9020\u8005,bug,\u75c5\u6bd2,computer", "title": "\u7231\u866b\u7684\u521b\u9020\u8005\u88ab\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5230\u9a6c\u5c3c\u62c9\u7684\u7ef4\u4fee\u5e97", "title_en": "Love Bug's creator tracked down to repair shop in Manila", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52458765", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u521b\u9020\u8005", "bug", "\u75c5\u6bd2", "computer"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "63ed6ae600ba8ae7edbec08bd0efeb97.png", "infoid": 1000469, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ea7\u54c1\u730e\u4eba\u7535\u53f0\u7cbe\u5f69\u7684\u4e00\u96c6\uff0c\u4e54\u4ec0\u00b7\u8c6a\u6c83\u65af\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u8bdd\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba9\u4f60\u627e\u5230\u70ed\u95e8\u8bdd\u9898\u6765\u56f4\u7ed5\u5176\u6253\u9020\u4ea7\u54c1\u6216\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6545\u4e8b\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u719f\u6089\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5236\u9020\u4ea7\u54c1\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8d5a\u94b1\uff0c\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u8425\u9500\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5ba2\u6237\u5374\u78b0\u58c1\u4e86\uff0c\u5931\u53bb\u4e86\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b0\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u4e5f\u559c\u6b22\u5b83\uff0c\u4e5f\u60f3\u8981\u5b83\uff0c\u6210\u957f\uff0c\u88ab\u6536\u8d2d\u3002", "note_en": "Great episode from Product Hunt Radio with Josh Howarth who founded Exploding Topics, an app that lets you find trending topics to build products or content around.

KVM is component of Linux kernel which makes use of VT-x. And QEMU is a user-space application which allows users to create virtual machines. QEMU makes use of KVM to achieve efficient virtualisation. In this article we will talk about how these three technologies work together. Don\u2019t expect an in-depth exposition about all aspects here, although in future, I might follow this up with more focused posts about some specific parts.\n  Let\u2019s first touch upon some theory before going into main discussion. Related to virtualisation is concept of  emulation \u2013\u00a0in simple words, faking the hardware. When you use QEMU or VMWare to create a virtual machine that has ARM processor, but your host machine has an x86 processor, then QEMU or VMWare would emulate or fake ARM processor. When we talk about virtualisation we mean hardware assisted virtualisation where the VM \u2019s processor matches host computer \u2019s processor. Often conflated with  ...\n    At the lowest level is hardware which supports virtualisation. Above it, hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM). In case of KVM, this is actually Linux kernel which has KVM modules loaded into it. In other words, KVM is a set of kernel modules that when loaded into Linux kernel turn the kernel into hypervisor. Above the hypervisor, and in user space, sit virtualisation applications that end users directly interact with \u2013QEMU, VMWare etc. These applications then create virtual machines which  ...\n Finally, there is \u201cfull\u201d vs. \u201cpara\u201d virtualisation dichotomy.  Full virtualisation is when OS that is running inside a VM is exactly the same as would be running on real hardware.  Paravirtualisation is when OS inside VM is aware that it is being virtualised and thus runs in a slightly modified way than it would on real hardware.\n  VT-x is CPU virtualisation for Intel 64 and IA-32 architecture. For Intel\u2019s Itanium, there is VT-I. For I/O virtualisation there is VT-d. AMD also has its virtualisation technology called AMD-V. We will only concern ourselves with VT-x.\n Under VT-x a CPU operates in one of two modes:  root and  non-root. These modes are orthogonal to real, protected, long etc, and also orthogonal to privilege rings (0-3). They form a new \u201cplane\u201d so to speak. Hypervisor runs in root mode and VMs run in non-root mode. When in non-root mode, CPU-bound code mostly executes in the same way as it would if running in root mode, which means that VM\u2019s CPU-bound operations run mostly at native speed. However, it doesn\u2019t have full freedom.\n Privileged instructions form a subset of all available instructions on a CPU. These are instructions that can only be executed if the CPU is in higher privileged state, e.g. current privilege level (CPL) 0 (where CPL 3 is least privileged). A subset of these privileged instructions are what we can call \u201cglobal state-changing \u201dinstructions \u2013those which affect the overall state of CPU. Examples are those instructions which modify clock or interrupt registers, or write to control registers  ...\n  Virtual Machine Extensions (VMX) are instructions that were added to facilitate VT-x. Let\u2019s look at some of them to gain a better understanding of how VT-x works.\n VMXON: Before this instruction is executed, there is no concept of root vs non-root modes. The CPU operates as if there was no virtualisation. VMXON must be executed in order to enter virtualisation. Immediately after VMXON, the CPU is in root mode.\n  VMLAUNCH: Creates an instance of a VM and enters non-root mode. We will explain what we mean by \u201cinstance of VM\u201d in a short while, when covering VMCS. For now think of it as a particular VM created inside QEMU or VMWare.\n  When a VM attempts to execute an instruction that is prohibited in non-root mode, CPU immediately switches to root mode in a trap-like way. This is called a VM exit.\n Let \u2019s synthesise the above information. CPU starts in a normal mode, executes VMXON to start virtualisation in root mode, executes VMLAUNCH to create and enter non-root mode for a VM instance, VM instance runs its own code as if running natively until it attempts something that is prohibited, that causes a VM exit and a switch to root mode. Recall that the software running in root mode is hypervisor. Hypervisor takes action to deal with the reason for VM exit and then executes VMRESUME  ...\n Of course the above description leaves some gaps. For example, how does hypervisor know why VM exit happened? And what makes one VM instance different from another? This is where VMCS comes in. VMCS stands for Virtual Machine Control Structure. It is basically a 4KiB part of physical memory which contains information needed for the above process to work. This information includes reasons for VM exit as well as information unique to each VM instance so that when CPU is in non-root mode,  ...\n As you may know, in QEMU or VMWare, we can decide how many CPUs a particular VM will have. Each such CPU is called a virtual CPU or vCPU. For each vCPU there is one VMCS. This means that VMCS stores information on CPU-level granularity and not VM level. To read and write a particular VMCS, VMREAD and VMWRITE instructions are used. They effectively require root mode so only hypervisor can modify VMCS. Non-root VM can perform VMWRITE but not to the actual VMCS, but a \u201cshadow \u201dVMCS \u2013 ...\n There are also instructions that operate on whole VMCS instances rather than individual VMCSs. These are used when switching between vCPUs, where a vCPU could belong to any VM instance. VMPTRLD is used to load the address of a VMCS and VMPTRST is used to store this address to a specified memory address. There can be many VMCS instances but only one is marked as current and active at any point. VMPTRLD marks a particular VMCS as active. Then, when VMRESUME is executed, the non-root  ...\n Here it\u2019s worth noting that all the VMX instructions above require CPL level 0, so they can only be executed from inside the Linux kernel (or other OS kernel).\n  Context info which contains things like CPU register values to save and restore during transitions between root and non-root.\n  Guest-state stores vCPU state on VM exit. On VMRESUME, vCPU state is restored from here.\n Host-state stores host CPU state on VMLAUNCH and VMRESUME. On VM exit, host CPU state is restored from here.\n VM execution control fields determine the behaviour of VM in non-root mode. For example hypervisor can set a bit in a VM execution control field such that whenever VM attempts to execute RDTSC instruction to read timestamp counter, the VM exits back to hypervisor.\n VM exit control fields determine the behaviour of VM exits. For example, when a bit in VM exit control part is set then debug register DR7 is saved whenever there is a VM exit.\n VM entry control fields determine the behaviour of VM entries. This is counterpart of VM exit control fields. A symmetric example is that setting a bit inside this field will cause the VM to always load DR7 debug register on VM entry.\n There are other aspects of hardware virtualisation support that we will conveniently gloss over in this post. Virtual to physical address conversion inside VM is done using a VT-x feature called Extended Page Tables (EPT). Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is used to cache virtual to physical mappings in order to save page table lookups. TLB semantics also change to accommodate virtual machines. Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) on a real machine is responsible  ...\n  Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a set of Linux kernel modules that when loaded, turn Linux kernel into hypervisor. Linux continues its normal operations as OS but also provides hypervisor facilities to user space. KVM modules can be grouped into two types: core module and machine specific modules. kvm.ko is the core module which is always needed. Depending on the host machine CPU, a machine specific module, like kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko will be needed. As you can guess,  ...\n KVM interacts with user space \u2013 in our case QEMU \u2013 in two ways: through device file `/dev/kvm` and through memory mapped pages. Memory mapped pages are used for bulk transfer of data between QEMU and KVM. More specifically, there are two memory mapped pages per vCPU and they are used for high volume data transfer between QEMU and the VM in kernel.\n `/dev/kvm` is the main API exposed by KVM. It supports a set of `ioctl`s which allow QEMU to manage VMs and interact with them. The lowest unit of virtualisation in KVM is a vCPU. Everything builds on top of it. The `/dev/kvm` API is a three-level hierarchy.\n System Level: Calls this API manipulate the global state of the whole KVM subsystem. This, among other things, is used to create VMs.\n VM Level: Calls to this API deal with a specific VM. vCPUs are created through calls to this API.\n vCPU Level: This is lowest granularity API and deals with a specific vCPU. Since QEMU dedicates one thread to each vCPU (see QEMU section below), calls to this API are done in the same thread that was used to create the vCPU.\n After creating vCPU QEMU continues interacting with it using the ioctls and memory mapped pages.\n  Quick Emulator (QEMU) is the only user space component we are considering in our VT-x/KVM/QEMU stack. With QEMU one can run a virtual machine with ARM or MIPS core but run on an Intel host. How is this possible? Basically QEMU has two modes:  emulator and  virtualiser. As an emulator, it can fake the hardware. So it can make itself look like a MIPS machine to the software running inside its VM. It does that through  binary translation. QEMU comes with  Tiny Code Generator (TCG)  ...\n The other mode of QEMU \u2013 as a virtualiser \u2013 is what achieves the type of virtualisation that we are discussing here. As virtualiser it gets help from KVM. It talks to KVM using ioctl\u2019s as described above.\n QEMU creates one process for every VM. For each vCPU, QEMU creates a thread. These are regular threads and they get scheduled by the OS like any other thread. As these threads get run time, QEMU creates impression of multiple CPUs for the software running inside its VM. Given QEMU \u2019s roots in emulation, it can emulate I/O which is something that KVM may not fully support \u2013take example of a VM with particular serial port on a host that doesn \u2019t have it.

Specifically, the letter addressed Amazon\u2019s apparent practice of diving into its trove of data on products and third-party sellers to come up with its own Amazon-branded competing products.\n As the Journal notes, Amazon \u201chas long asserted, including to Congress, that when it makes and sells its own products, it doesn\u2019t use information it collects from the site\u2019s individual third-party sellers\u2014data those sellers view as proprietary.\u201d\n   In documents and interviews with many former employees, the Journal found that Amazon does indeed consult that information

Instants are an opaque thing and only good for getting you the difference between two of them, resulting in a  Duration.Good  ...\n How is  Instant implemented?That depends on the operating system your running your code on.Luckily the documentation lists the (currently) used system calls to get time information.\n     But how do we replace operating system functionality?Turns out functions are merely a name and the linker tries to figure out where the code behind them is and then points to that.\n If we look at a simpler version of our code without any  #[no_mangle] extern &#34;C&#34; functions we can see where these come from:\n (macOS) \u276f nm -a ./instant | rg mach_absolute_time U _mach_absolute_time(linux) \u276f nm -a instant | rg clock_gettime U clock_gettime@@GLIBC_2.17\n nm lists symbols from object files.That  U right there stands for  undefined: The binary doesn&#39;t have knowledge where it comes from(though in the case of Linux it gave it a slightly different name letting us guess what to expect).Details about this symbol are later filled in, once your program is loaded and symbols to dynamic libaries are resolved(and I&#39;m sure the  &#34;Making our own executable packer&#34; series by  @fasterthanlimewill have lots more details on it, I should  ...\n   So now let&#39;s try to expose a function under the same name from our code.  Note: I&#39;m only doing the macOS part here, it works the same for Linux.\n   it will not turn up in the final binary at all and  rustc right fully complains:\n  Even making it  pub won&#39;t work.By default symbols such as function names get  mangled; some additional information is encoded into the name as well and at the same time this ensures uniqueness of names(see also  Name Mangling).One can disable that in Rust using the  #[no_mangle] attribute. So we apply that.\n We&#39;re trying to override a function that is defined in terms of C.C has slightly different calling conventions than Rust.It&#39;s part of their respective ABIs: how data is passed in and out of functions.In Rust one can define the used ABI with the  extern &#34;name&#34; tag.So we add that.\n    (macOS) \u276f nm -a ./instant | rg mach_absolute_time0000000100000c20 T _mach_absolute_time(linux) \u276f nm -a instant | rg clock_gettime0000000000005250 T clock_gettime\n Now we know that the symbol is defined somewhere in the binary (&#34;T - The symbol is in the text (code) section.&#34;)and also the location ( 0000000100000c20 /  0000000000005250).\n If this program is run it will still need to resolve undefined symbols ... but this time our functions are not undefined anymore.As the stdlib just calls whatever is behind that respective name it now calls our code instead!\n And yes, this works for pretty much all the functions defined by other libraries or

theorist, and currently  emeritus professor at the  University of California, Berkeley. His theories about the nature of human-centered  design have affected fields beyond architecture, including  urban design,  software,  sociology and others.  [3]Alexander has designed and personally built over 100 buildings, both as an  ...\n In software, Alexander is regarded as the father of the  pattern language movement. The first  wiki\u2014the technology behind  Wikipedia\u2014led directly from Alexander&#39;s work, according to its creator,  Ward Cunningham.  [6]  [7]  [8] Alexander&#39;s work has also influenced the development of  agile software development.  [8]\n In architecture, Alexander&#39;s work is used by a number of different contemporary architectural communities of practice, including the  New Urbanist movement, to help people to reclaim control over their own built environment.  [9] However, Alexander is controversial among some mainstream architects and critics, in part because his work is often harshly critical of much of contemporary architectural theory and practice.  [10]\n Alexander is known for many books on the design and building process, including   Notes on the Synthesis of Form,  A City is Not a Tree (first published as a paper and re-published in book form in 2015),   The Timeless Way of Building, A New Theory of Urban Design, and   The Oregon Experiment. More recently he published the four-volume   The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe,about his newer theories of &#34;morphogenetic&#34;  ...\n Alexander is perhaps best known for his 1977 book   A Pattern Language, a perennial seller some four decades after publication.  [11] Reasoning that users are more sensitive to their needs than any architect could be,  [12]  [13]  [14] he produced and validated (in collaboration with his students Sara Ishikawa,  Murray Silverstein, Max Jacobson, Ingrid King, and Shlomo Angel) a &#34; pattern language&#34; to empower anyone to design and build at any scale.\n   As a young child Alexander emigrated in fall 1938  [15] with his parents from Austria to England, when his parents were forced to flee the Nazi regime. He spent much of his childhood in  Chichester and  Oxford, England, where he began his education in the sciences. He moved from England to the United States in 1958 to study at  Harvard University and  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He moved to  Berkeley, Californiain 1963 to accept an appointment  ...\n  Alexander attended  Oundle School, England. In 1954, he was awarded the top open scholarship to  Trinity College,  Cambridge University in chemistry and physics, and went on to read mathematics. He earned a  Bachelor&#39;s degree in Architecture and a  Master&#39;s degree in Mathematics. He took his doctorate at Harvard (the first  PhD in Architecture ever awarded at  Harvard University), and was elected fellow at Harvard. During the same period he worked  ...\n  Alexander was elected to the  Society of Fellows, Harvard University 1961-64; awarded the First Medal for Research by the American Institute of Architects, 1972;  [16] elected member of the Swedish Royal Academy, 1980; winner of the Best Building in Japan award, 1985; winner of the ACSA (Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture) Distinguished Professor Award, 1986 and 1987;  [17]invited to present the Louis Kahn Memorial Lecture, 1992; awarded  ...\n   The Timeless Way of Building (1979) described the perfection of use to which buildings could aspire:\n There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following  ...\n A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction (1977) described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a  generative grammar.\n The work originated from an observation that many medieval cities are attractive and harmonious. The authors said that this occurs because they were built to local regulations that required specific features, but freed the architect to adapt them to particular situations.\n The book provides rules and pictures, and leaves decisions to be taken from the precise environment of the project. It describes exact methods for constructing practical, safe and attractive designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs.\n A notable value is that the architectural system consists only of classic patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality.\n The book includes all needed surveying and structural calculations, and a novel simplified building system that copes with regional shortages of wood and steel, uses easily stored inexpensive materials, and produces long-lasting classic buildings with small amounts of materials, design and labor. It first has users prototype a structure on-site in temporary materials. Once accepted, these are finished by filling them with very-low-density concrete.  ...\n This book&#39;s method was adopted by the University of Oregon, as described in   The Oregon Experiment (1975), and remains the official planning instrument. It has also been adopted in part by some cities as a building code.\n The idea of a  pattern language appears to apply to any complex engineering task, and has been applied to some of them. It has been especially influential in  software engineering where  patterns have been used to document collective knowledge in the field.\n A New Theory of Urban Design (1987) coincided with a renewal of interest in  urbanism among architects, but stood apart from most other expressions of this by assuming a distinctly anti-masterplanning stance. An account of a design studio conducted with Berkeley students on a site in  San Francisco, it shows how convincing urban networks can be generated by requiring individual actors to respect only  localrules, in relation to neighbours.  ...\n The Nature of Order: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe (2003\u201304), which includes The  Phenomenon of Life,  The Process of Creating Life,  A Vision of a Living World and  The Luminous Ground, is Alexander&#39;s most comprehensive and elaborate work. In it, he puts forth a new theory about the nature of space and describes how this theory influences thinking about architecture, building, planning, and the way in  ...\n The online publication  Katarxis 3 (September 2004) includes several essays by Christopher Alexander, as well as the legendary debate between Alexander and  Peter Eisenman from 1982.  [23]\n Alexander&#39;s latest book,  The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle Between Two World-Systems(2012), is the story of the largest project he and his colleagues had ever tackled, the construction of a new High School/College campus in Japan. He also uses the project to connect with themes in his four-volume series. He contrasts his approach, (System A) with the construction processes endemic in the US and Japanese economies  ...\n  Among Alexander&#39;s most notable built works are the Eishin Campus near  Tokyo (the building process of which is outlined in his 2012 book  The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth); the West Dean Visitors Centre  [24] in West Sussex, England; the Julian Street Inn (a homeless shelter) in  San Jose, California (both described in  Nature of Order); the  Sala Houseand the Martinez House (experimental houses in Albany and Martinez, California  ...\n His former student and colleague  Michael Mehaffy wrote an introductory essay on Alexander&#39;s built work in the online publication  Katarxis 3, which includes a gallery of Alexander&#39;s major built projects through September 2004.  [25]\n  In addition to his lengthy teaching career as a Professor at  UC Berkeley (during which a number of international students began to appreciate and apply his methods), Alexander was a key faculty member at both The Prince of Wales&#39;s Summer Schools in Civil Architecture (1990\u20131994) and  The Prince&#39;s Foundation for the Built Environment.  [26] He also initiated the process which led to the international  Building Beautypost-graduate  ...\n   Alexander&#39;s work has widely influenced architects; among those who acknowledge his influence are  Sarah Susanka,  [29]  Andres Duany,  [30] and  Witold Rybczynski.  [31]  Robert Campbell, the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic for the  Boston Globe, stated that Alexander &#34;has had an enormous critical influence on my life and work, and I think that&#39;s true of a whole generation of people.&#34;  [31]\n Architecture critic  Peter Buchanan, in an essay for   The Architectural Review &#39;s 2012 campaign  The Big Rethink, argues that Alexander&#39;s work as reflected in  A Pattern Language is &#34;thoroughly subversive and forward looking rather than regressive, as so many misunderstand it to be.&#34; He continues:\n  Even architects not immune to the charms of the places depicted, are loath to pursue the folksy aesthetic they see as implied and do not want to engage with such primitive construction \u2014although the systemic collapse now unfolding may force that upon them. The daunting challenge for architects then, if such a thing is even possible to realise, would be to recreate in a more contemporary idiom both the richness and quality of experience  ...\n Many urban development projects continue to incorporate Alexander&#39;s ideas. For example, in the UK the developers  Living Villages have been highly influenced by Alexander&#39;s work and used  A Pattern Language as the basis for the design of The Wintles in Bishops Castle, Shropshire.  [33]  Sarah Susanka&#39;s &#34;Not So Big House&#34; movement adapts and popularizes Alexander&#39;s patterns and outlook.\n  Alexander&#39;s   Notes on the Synthesis of Form was said to be required reading for researchers in computer science throughout the 1960s. It had an influence  [34] in the 1960s and 1970s on  programming language design, modular programming,  object-oriented programming,  software engineering and other design methodologies. Alexander&#39;s mathematical concepts and orientation were similar to  Edsger Dijkstra&#39;s influential  A Discipline  ...\n The greatest influence of   A Pattern Language in computer science is the  design patterns movement.  [36] Alexander&#39;s philosophy of incremental, organic, coherent design also influenced the  extreme programming movement.  [37] The  Wiki was invented  [6]  [7] to allow the Hillside Group to work on programming  design patterns. More recently the &#34;deep geometrical structures&#34; as discussed in   The Nature of Orderhave been cited  ...\n Will Wright wrote that Alexander&#39;s work was influential in the origin of the   SimCity computer games, and in his later game   Spore.  [39]\n Alexander has often led his own software research, such as the 1996 Gatemaker project with  Greg Bryant.  [40]  [41]\n Alexander discovered and conceived a recursive structure, so called wholeness, which is defined mathematically, exists in space and matter physically, and reflects in our minds and cognition psychologically. He had his idea of wholeness back to early 1980s when he finished his very first version of  The Nature of Order. In fact, his idea of wholeness or degree of wholeness relying a recursive structure of centers resemble in  ...\n  The fourth volume of   The Nature of Order approaches religious questions from a scientific and philosophical rather than mystical direction. In it, Alexander describes deep ties between the nature of matter,  human perception of the universe, and the geometries people construct in buildings, cities, and artifacts. He suggests a crucial link between traditional practices and  beliefs, and recent scientific advances.  [43]Despite  ...\n  The life&#39;s work of Alexander is dedicated to turn design from unselfconscious behavior to selfconscious behavior, so called design science. In his very first book  Notes on the Synthesis of Forms, he has set what he wanted to do. He was inspired by traditional buildings, and tried to derive some 253 patterns for architectural design. Later on, he further distills 15 geometric properties to characterize living structure  ...\n  In his classic  A City is Not a Tree, he already had some primary ideas of complex networks, although he used semilattice rather than complex networks. In his first book  Notes on the synthesis of forms on page 65, he illustrated something that is in fact community or community structure in complex networks, a recent topic emerged around 2004:  community structure.\n   The  Center for Environmental Structure Series, made up of Foreshadowing of 21st Century Art: The Color and Geometry of Very Early Turkish Carpets (1993)\n     The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle between Two World-Systems, with HansJoachim Neis and Maggie More Alexander (2012)\n      ^     a     b    &#34;Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A&#34;  (PDF).

"note_en": "Professor Didier Raoult said data on the spread of the virus suggested it had reached a \u201cbell curve\u201d which he claimed was a typical epidemic cycle which should rule out the prospect of a rebound.\n   Prof Raoult said: &#34;The second wave story is a fantasy that was invented from the Spanish flu, which started in the summer and has nothing to do with it.\n &#34;Usually an epidemic happens in one curve. I hate to make predictions, but this way of constructing it is fairly common for epidemics.\n \u201cIn the past, epidemics disappeared long before we had the means to contain them. They disappeared anyway.\n &#34;Humanity didn&#39;t die from an epidemic, that&#39;s the way it is. Epidemics start, accelerate, peak, disappear, and we don&#39;t know why.\u201d\n  Prof Raoult said the French government&#39;s plans to start easing lockdown measures on May 11 was justified.\n He also backed the results of a study carried out by Singaporean researchers who predicted 97 percent of COVID-19 cases in France would have happened by around May 7.\n Prof Raoult said: &#34;The data provided by the president is not extravagant. 97 percent of the cases will have occurred around 7th May and 99 percent around 19th May.\n &#34;This is the time when we should be able to confine and isolate infected people, knowing that by then the virus transmission will have become much lower.&#34;\n   Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said France would adopt an aggressive programme of COVID-19 testing from May 11 and warned citizens had to be disciplined to avoid a new outbreak.\n Mr Philippe said the lockdown had saved tens of thousands of lives but that the time had come to ease the unprecedented peacetime restrictions and rescue an economy in free-fall.\n But he warned that the infection rate would spiral if France moved too swiftly and people became complacent.\n  He said: &#34;We are on a knife&#39;s edge. I am having to choose between bad decisions.\n &#34;We must protect the French people without paralysing France to the point that it collapses.\n &#34;A little too much carefreeness and the epidemic takes off again. Too much prudence and the whole country buckles.&#34;\n    From May 11, schools will gradually reopen and businesses will be free to resume operations.\n Restaurants, cafes and beaches, though, will remain closed until at least June, while professional sports are suspended until September.\n  The planned timeline hinges on the number of new coronavirus infections remaining below 3,000 per day.\n Mr Philippe said the government would slow or delay the unwinding of the lockdown if the infection rate spiked markedly higher with administrative departments divided into red and green zones.\n He said: &#34;If the indicators are not good enough, we won&#39;t unwind the lockdown on May 11, or we will do it more strictly.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-03 16:42:31", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u4e13\u5bb6,\u6d41\u884c\u75c5", "title": "\u6cd5\u56fd\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a73\u65a5\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6ce2\u6050\u60e7\u5c06\u8b66\u544a\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3a\u5e7b\u60f3", "title_en": "French coronavirus expert REJECTS second wave fears branding warnings a fantasy", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1275573/france-coronavirus-latest-news-second-wave-covid19-lockdown-updates", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u4e13\u5bb6", "\u6d41\u884c\u75c5"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0523d9e23a4f0a6427f23cbd05bf57f2.jpg", "infoid": 1000463, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ebf\u4e07\u5bcc\u7fc1\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6c83\u4f26\u00b7\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u00b7\u54c8\u6492\u97e6\u5df2\u7ecf\u51fa\u552e\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u56db\u5927\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6240\u6709\u80a1\u4efd\u3002\n\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u5728\u5e74\u5ea6\u80a1\u4e1c\u5927\u4f1a\u4e0a\u53d1\u8868\u8bb2\u8bdd\u65f6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u3002\n\u636e\u8def\u900f\u793e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u5c31\u5728\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u53d1\u8868\u8bc4\u8bba\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u524d\uff0c\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u54c8\u6492\u97e6\u516c\u53f8\u5ba3\u5e03\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b63\u5ea6\u51c0\u4e8f\u635f\u8fbe\u5230\u521b\u7eaa\u5f55\u7684500\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143(400\u4ebf\u82f1\u9551)\u3002\n\u6839\u636e\u5176\u5e74\u62a5\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u5907\u6848\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u8be5\u96c6\u56e2\u6301\u6709\u8fbe\u7f8e\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f811%\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f810%\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\uff0c\u897f\u5357\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f810%\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f89%\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\u3002\n\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u907f\u5f00\u822a\u7a7a\u4e1a\u591a\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u4e8e2016\u5e74\u5f00\u59cb\u6295\u8d44\u8fd9\u56db\u5bb6\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u662f\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u4e1a\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e00\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u5728\u4e8f\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u628a\u94b1\u4ece\u4f01\u4e1a\u91cc\u62ff\u51fa\u6765\u7684\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8d44\u52a9\u4e00\u5bb6\u2026\u2026\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b83\u5728\u672a\u6765\u4f1a\u5403\u6389\u94b1\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002&#34\uff1b\n\u7531\u4e8e\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u65c5\u6e38\u4e1a\u51e0\u4e4e\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u53d6\u6d88\u4e86\u6570\u5341\u4e07\u4e2a\u822a\u73ed\uff0c\u6570\u5343\u67b6\u98de\u673a\u505c\u6b62\u670d\u52a1\u3002\n\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u75ab\u60c5\u6765\u88ad\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u8003\u8651\u6295\u8d44\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ece\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u8bf4\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u67af\u7aed\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6253\u51fb\u3002\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7981\u6b62\u822a\u7a7a\u65c5\u884c\u3002\n\u8fbe\u7f8e\u822a\u7a7a\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u548c\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u56e2\u961f\u6000\u6709\u6781\u5927\u7684\u656c\u610f\u3002", "note_en": "Billionaire investor Warren Buffett says his company Berkshire Hathaway has sold all of its shares in the four largest US airlines.\n Speaking at the annual shareholders&#39;

We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss.\n &#34;We will not fund a company that... where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.&#34;\n  The US travel industry has almost collapsed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with airlines cutting hundreds of thousands of flights and taking thousands of planes out of service.\n Mr Buffett said he had been considering investing in additional airlines before the pandemic hit.\n &#34;It is a blow to have, essentially, your demand dry up,&#34; he said. &#34;It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country.&#34;\n  In a statement, Delta said it was aware of the sale and has &#34;tremendous respect for Mr Buffett and the Berkshire team&#34;.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 15:54:59", "tags": "\u5df4\u83f2\u7279,\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14,\u51fa\u552e,buffett,airlines", "title": "\u6c83\u4f26\u00b7\u5df4\u83f2\u7279\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14\u00b7\u54c8\u6492\u97e6\u51fa\u552e\u5176\u6301\u6709\u7684\u6240\u6709\u7f8e\u56fd\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u80a1\u7968", "title_en": "Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway sells all of its US airline shares", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52518186", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u5df4\u83f2\u7279", "\u4f2f\u514b\u5e0c\u5c14", "\u51fa\u552e", "buffett", "airlines"]}]
