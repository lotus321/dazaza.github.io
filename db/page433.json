The situation remains fluid, according to the Journal&#39;s sources.\n Shares of Hertz declined more than 15% in trading Wednesday, as broader indices rose, following The Wall Street Journal&#39;s report.\n The news of a possible bankruptcy arrives two days after Hertz on Monday said in a  regulatory filing\u00a0that it &#34;did not make certain payments&#34; on its operating lease as it remains in discussions with lenders to reduce its payments. If those discussions aren&#39;t fruitful by the first week of May, &#34;Hertz could be materially and negatively impacted,&#34; it said.\n    Earlier in April,  the company laid off 10,000 workers \u2014 about 26% of its workforce at the end of 2019 \u2014 &#34;in an effort to align staffing levels with travel demand.&#34;\n A Hertz representative said they were &#34;unable to comment&#34; on the Wall Street Journal report, but offered the following statement regarding the filings:\n &#34;As a result of the pandemic and the uncertainty about the timing and strength of a recovery, Hertz is taking aggressive actions to preserve liquidity to support its ongoing operations,&#34; they said. &#34;We are reducing expenses, deferring capital expenditures, and adjusting fleet\u00a0levels and staffing based on the significant decline in travel demand. Our\u00a0 8-ktoday provided an update on our vehicle financing. Importantly, conversations with our lenders are ongoing and we remain in discussions  ...\n Ryan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan, theorized on April 23 that government assistance could help Hertz remain solvent.\n   &#34;We do think a potentially large amount of cash could be made available to Hertz from the federal government, potentially solving any liquidity concerns, although we are also uncertain with regard to the terms,&#34; he said in a note to clients.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:49:17", "tags": "\u79df\u8f66,rental,\u8d6b\u5179,hertz", "title":

"note_en": "The Mustang community is mourning the great loss of an automotive icon that lost his short battle with liver cancer.\n Gale Halderman is a legendary name in the Ford Mustang world. Not only did Gale take pride working at Ford Motor Company for 40 years, but he was also a member of the Mustang Hall of Fame. Last but most certainly not least, Gale was the main designer of the original Ford Mustang. Sadly, the car community is mourning a great loss as Gale Halderman just passed away at the age of 87 after a short battle with liver cancer.\n  The night before Gale had a big meeting about Lee Iacocca&#39;s new concept car called the  Ford Mustang, he stayed up late at his kitchen table and sketched out his idea. He knew that it needed to have a few attributes. The new  Mustangneeded to be sporty, exciting, and appeal to both genders. A long hood with a short deck would be ideal. The heat was on as many other Ford designers were also sketching out their very own ideas for the cat. Gale and his boss Jim Oros collaborated and worked on their  ...\n We have to give credit where credit is due. Who knows where Ford&#39;s iconic pony car would stand today if Gale&#39;s sketch wasn&#39;t chosen and ultimately turned into the 1965 (or 1964 1/2)  Ford Mustang, an iconic classic that is as much of an American staple as apple pie. If you want to go even deeper, the modern Mustang would \u00a0probably look nothing like it does today if it weren&#39;t for the original car designed by Gale, and even more, it is quite possible that the  Mustangname may not  ...\n Gale&#39;s legacy goes even further than that. He was employed with Ford Motor Company for a long four decades as a designer or designer executive. The word legend isn&#39;t lightly tossed around as he had worked alongside the top names at Ford such as Henry Ford II, Hal Sperlich, and of course, Lee Iacocca. Bill Ford Jr. once answered to Gale as his boss at one point in time during his time at the Blue Oval.\n   Once Gale eventually retired from the Blue Oval, he dedicated his time to turn their family barn into a museum all about the car&#39;s design. Since Gale was a humble man, this wasn&#39;t a way to showcase his own work, but a place where he could mostly showcase the work of others. We could all certainly agree that we wouldn&#39;t mind to see a museum dedicated to Gale and his many accomplishments. The walls are adorned with sketches, concepts, and designs collected over time from talented artists  ...\n Gale was a legend and left a legacy. He is survived by three daughters, nine grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. Not only that, he is survived by the countless individuals considered his Mustang family over the past 55 years. Rest in peace, Gale Halderman.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:49:08", "tags": "\u798f\u7279,\u8bbe\u8ba1,\u91ce\u9a6c,ford,gale", "title":

"Health Officers caution that reducing restrictions too quickly could lead to a substantial resurgence of COVID-19\n          Santa Clara County, CA \u2013\u00a0The seven Bay Area Public Health Officers who ordered a shelter in place in mid-March will  extend the orders through May 31while some restrictions are eased and tools to strengthen containment of COVID-19 are put into place. The social distancing intervention has slowed the increase of new cases and prevented the anticipated medical surge. As restrictions are eased, it is critical to ensure that growth of cases can be sufficiently contained to protect the  ...\n  All construction activities, certain businesses that operate primarily outdoors, and some outdoor activities will be allowed to resume with specific conditions.\n  These new Health Officer orders, which take effect May 4, cover everyone living or working in the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara as well as the City of Berkeley, an independent public health jurisdiction. As of April 28, 2020, there are 7,273 confirmed cases (up from 258 confirmed cases on March 15, 2020) and 266 deaths (up from 4 deaths on March 15, 2020) in the seven Bay Area jurisdictions jointly issuing this Order.\n  This next phase reflects regional progress, thanks to the collective action Bay Area residents have taken since mid-March in response to Health Officer shelter-in-place orders. Those actions have saved lives and staved off mass hospitalizations from the COVID-19 virus, which spreads easily and causes severe illness in many people.\u00a0 There is not yet an effective treatment or cure for the disease.\n  This initial, measured easing of some restrictions is designed to set the stage for a gradual resumption of activity and prevent rapid, exponential growth of cases that could overwhelm hospitals for a particular jurisdiction or the region as a whole.\n  &#34;This impact of the virus has been hard for many of us, but we are now on a path for steady progress, which now allows some low-risk activities to return,&#34; said Dr. Lisa B. Hernandez, Health Officer for the City of Berkeley. &#34;This virus is still in our communities. We need everyone to shelter-in-place apart from the few exceptions \u2013 and wear a face covering when out.&#34;\n  &#34;The new order allows us to carefully monitor our progress while building the essential public health infrastructure \u2013 such as contact tracing and testing capacity \u2013 that will support our gradual reopening and make recovery possible,&#34; said Dr. Tom\u00e1s Aragon, Health Officer for the City and County of San Francisco.\n  Under the new orders, all construction projects will be allowed to resume as long as the project complies with safety protocols included with the order.\u00a0 All real estate transactions will also now be able to resume, but with continued restrictions on open houses and limitations on in-person viewings.\u00a0 Any employee allowed to return to work at a facility can also access childcare programs that can operate.\n  Certain outdoor businesses can also begin operating again, and people can visit those businesses to perform work or obtain goods, services, or supplies.\u00a0 This includes wholesale and retail nurseries, landscapers, gardeners, and other businesses that primarily provide outdoor services as set forth in the order.\u00a0 Outdoor businesses do not include restaurants, cafes or bars, regardless of whether they have outdoor seating.\n  Other activities that can resume under the new order include residential moves and the use of certain shared outdoor recreational facilities that were previously ordered closed, like skate parks, but not others that involve shared equipment or physical contact.\n  These orders are generally consistent with the state&#39;s shelter in place order.\u00a0 On any issue where the local and state orders may differ, the stricter order applies.\n  These orders are generally consistent with the state&#39;s shelter in place order.\u00a0 On any issue where the local and state orders may differ, the stricter order applies.\n              Health Officers are also releasing  indicators\u200b that will be used to measure progress in containing the virus and ensuring we have the infrastructure in place to protect the community from COVID-19.\u00a0 These indicators will be critical to decisions in the coming weeks and months about when and how to ease shelter-in-place restrictions.\n    Whether there is an adequate supply of personal protective equipment for all health care workers;\n  Whether we are meeting the need for testing, especially for persons in vulnerable populations or those in high-risk settings or occupations; and\n  Whether we have the capacity to investigate all COVID-19 cases and trace all of their contacts, isolating those who test positive and quarantining the people who may have been exposed.\n  &#34;A pandemic of this scale is unprecedented,&#34; said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County Health Officer. &#34;We are progressing steadily as a region, but we must reduce restrictions on activity gradually or we will put the lives of many community members at risk.&#34;\n                                      \r\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:49:00", "tags":

money but the state won&#39;t get a say: this is a concise summary of what Lufthansa&#39;s Executive Board, headed by CEO Carsten Spohr, has been telling German politicians in the past few weeks.\n According to an investigation by Business Insider, Lufthansa is now so up to its neck in water, the airline&#39;s management had to come to an agreement with the German state on the afternoon of Monday, April 27, after hours of negotiations.\n The agreement entails the state using $10 billion to bail out Germany&#39;s last remaining international airline.\n    It&#39;s expected that one or two supervisory board mandates will be given to the German federal government.\n  However, as a result of the worldwide travel restrictions in the Corona crisis, Lufthansa is currently making losses of around $1 million every hour.\n  Founded in 1953, Lufthansa began flight operations two years later and was, until 1963, entirely in state hands.\n   The federal government, however, sold its shares in the mid-1990s, so Lufthansa has been fully privatized since 1997.\n  According to the investigation, the state is pumping just under $10 billion into the badly hit company.\n In return, the government, as the new shareholder, will receive a blocking minority and one or two supervisory board seats, but these will not be filled by civil servants or politicians.\n Formally, the company will then be associated with the Federal Ministry of Finance as a state holding.\n     The most crucial factor in the agreement was that the appointment of civil servants or politicians to the supervisory board was unacceptable in the eyes of Lufthansa&#39;s executives.\n  Spohr himself didn&#39;t officially take part in yesterday&#39;s talks but on Tuesday, he wants to formally seal the deal with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany&#39;s finance minister, Olaf Scholz.\n Through the investigation, Business Insider learned that it&#39;s unlikely the matter will be negotiated again.\n   Spohr had recently proposed an Airbus model for Lufthansa. Germany, France, and Spain hold a quarter of the shares of the aircraft manufacturer but don&#39;t exercise any direct influence over the company.\n  Read the original article on  Business Insider Deutschland.

the California state COVID-19 emergency response website in collaboration with the CHHS Office of Innovation and the California Department of Technology.\n  Our challenge: Create a scalable, accessible, stable website that is easy to update in a fast changing public health crisis. And do it in four days.\n  This challenge is one that will be familiar to our digital colleagues working in other states, cities and countries right now. We\u2019ve been super impressed by and appreciative of the work being done in places like  San Francisco,  New Jersey and the  United Kingdom.\n  Just like those teams, we\u2019ve been focused on prioritizing user needs in this time of crisis. And we thought it could be useful to share out how we\u2019ve been using technology/development decisions to do this.\n  For our team, we started by returning to one of our core principles: \u201cAlways accessible.\u201d\n  We recognize, of course, that \u201cAlways accessible\u201d is not a novel approach. Here in California accessibility is a guiding principle in the state\u2019s digital strategy. And our work is just one part of the state\u2019s larger commitment to ensuring that information and services are accessible.\n  What is novel is how our team is broadening the definition of accessibility for state government to include performance as a core component. Performance as accessibility.\n  Our goal is to make COVID19.CA.gov fast and easy to use on any kind of hardware or with any level of bandwidth.\n  We\u2019re not yet 100% accessible \u2013 but accessibility is 100% our north star and what we are working toward every day.\n      We run automated audits which give us performance and accessibility scores on every build. Getting a high score on these automated tools is a good initial indicator, but not the whole story. We also manually test sites, ensuring we remain accessible via alternative navigation modes. We test with screen readers, which gives us a sense of how our site is experienced by site-impaired users. This helps find and eliminate interactions that might trap or slow people down.\n  We\u2019re grateful for support from the  California Department of Rehabilitation. The DOR team trained us to use those screen readers and has been instrumental helping us understand and avoid many common issues often created accidentally.\n  And we\u2019re grateful to the CHHS Office of Innovation whose team members are the frontline in our work to make our content accessible and clear.\n    Fast sites are more successful than slow ones. And some tools make it easier than others to produce fast sites.\n  Our team uses Bootstrap, which by default, is quite large. So we make sure to run CSS pruning processes to trim out all unused code before deploying to production. We also avoid the Bootstrap javascript widgets because we prefer using small, low dependency Web Components.\n    Delivering the desired layout and interactivity with a small code footprint allows us to hit our performance goals more easily. We create light frontend interactivity by publishing Web Components. When we have to build our own we use some of the  open-wc build tools that help by providing models for running components in isolation and integrated testing patterns.\n  We are mostly depending on the custom element part of the web component standard. This lets us easily use components on different properties with an npm install and using the tag on a page, allowing us to provide the maximum amount of flexibility and reuse. Building new frontend properties using Web Components is a user-first choice for many reasons:\n  Web Components can be modified in isolation and versioned so consumers can choose which versions to install\n  These advantages give new code a better chance for longevity and higher probability that our current efforts are providing future benefit instead of technical debt.\n  We are aware that building our own  components when necessary is a big decision. We only undertake this when we can\u2019t find existing options that use dependencies sparingly and provide the required UI. When creating new components we run tests\u00a0 in browsers, down to IE11, as well as ensuring they adhere to all of our other standards for accessibility and performance.\n    We\u2019re proud to have achieved a high score on our  Lighthouse performance audit but that isn\u2019t enough for government tools, especially in this time of crisis.\n  We need to go above and beyond to ensure that all users are able to get a performant experience, no matter their device. This is especially true since users aren\u2019t able to shop around for a different, better government experience.\n  So we picked up the cheapest phone they had at Cricket Wireless. A $20 device running Android 9, with no contract commitment has been one of the most useful and effective tools in our effort to be accessible.\n  The experience on this device is pretty different from what we see on the newest iPhones or Google Pixel devices. Pages delivering a lot of javascript are slow to render and respond to interaction, any scroll triggered effects look terrible and not actually cool (like they look on a new iPhone). Even swiping quickly through long, complex pages can be frustrating and slow as the device struggles to render lots of content.\n  Leaner, faster sites benefit  everybody, but making sure your applications run smoothly on low-end hardware makes a massive difference for those users.\n    As we add new features, it can be difficult to keep tabs on how our performance is changing. As well as using Lighthouse, we\u2019ve introduced Calibre to our reporting, as this enabled us to keep our builds fast. We\u2019re able to trigger performance and accessibility reports on each build with a process running outside of the build itself.\n      We can use this same data to report to our dashboards. This helps us with visibility to the whole team, not just the engineers.\n      Alex Russell, Senior Staff Software Engineer for Chrome at Google, kindly  analyzed the covid19.ca.gov site. He identified some areas for improvement with our fonts and integration with Google Analytics.\n  We were stoked to have\u00a0 Alex\u2019s deep expertise benefit COVID19.CA.gov. And we\u2019re deeply appreciative of his advocacy to pay attention to performance.\n  Overall, Alex found that the covid19.ca.gov site was fast, rendered quickly and finished all operations faster than similar sites, which helps users get the information they need quickly and easily.\n        API endpoints running on FAAS allow us to keep our backend code in isolated, cheap, scalable components. The  @CAdotGov team is running infrastructure mostly on Azure.  Carter Medlin set up the first APIs on Azure\u2019s FAAS services.\n      Covid19.ca.gov received millions of visitors in the hours after Governor Newsom announced the statewide Stay at Home Order.\n  The site was able to handle this level of traffic easily because we removed every unnecessary piece from the production service pipeline. This provided us with peace of mind ahead of launch, lowers costs and improves stability. While our content is constantly updated and deployed automatically, we create a pregenerated version of the final build each time so that production systems serve the body of pages as static  ...\n  We chose  11ty as our static content generator because we like their philosophy and emphasis on performance and accessibility. Making the production build a set of static files removes a lot of common bottlenecks. Scaling concerns are radically simplified because the initial content is delivered without database connections or even any server side code execution.\n  Removing complexity and risk from the production pipeline doesn\u2019t require us to forego any interactivity or force us to abandon mature open source tools.\n  We are making the choice to run all computation possible before deployment. We are still using APIs for data driven interactions, such as the  Telehealth provider lookups page. Content is authored in our private WordPress repository and the output is integrated with 11ty, so we don\u2019t run PHP on public servers.\n    We chose WordPress for their premier authoring environment but decided not to use it as a content delivery tool. This allowed us to take advantage of the mature writing tools WordPress provides without needing to support any of its dependencies in our production environment.\n  We were able to decouple WordPress authoring from reading by using its built in API. We set its publish trigger to notify our Function as a Service (FAAS) service when content was updated. Our  FAAS tool moved the post content from WordPress to Github.\n  We then used  a Github Action to trigger 11ty builds and deploy to a browseable github pages branch which then triggers the deploy to our Azure production environment\n      We know that the COVID-19 pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint. We\u2019re mindful there\u2019s more work to do in the coming weeks and months. And our team is looking forward to continuing to meet the challenge of this moment by ensuring that the people of California get the information they need quickly and easily.", "posttime": "2020-05-02

"note_en": "Last week, we started at 1 and slowly and steadily worked our way up to 1,000,000. We used dots. It was cute.\n  Before things get totally out of hand, let\u2019s start by working our way up the still-fathomable powers of 10\u2014\n  When we went from 1 to 1,000,000, we didn\u2019t need powers\u2014we could just use a short string of digits to represent the numbers we were talking about. If we wanted to multiply a number by 10, we just added a zero.\n But as you advance past a million, zeros start to become plentiful and you need a different notation. That\u2019s why we use powers. When people talk about exponential growth, they\u2019re referring to the craziness that can happen when you start using powers. For example:\n  As we get bigger and bigger today, we\u2019ll stick with powers of 10, because when you start talking about really big numbers, what becomes relevant is the number of digits, not the digits themselves\u2014i.e. every 70-digit number is somewhere between 10 69 and 10 70, which is really all you need to know. So for at least the first part of this post, the powers of 10 can serve nicely as orders-of-magnitude \u201ccheckpoints\u201d.\n Each time we up the power by one, we multiply the world we\u2019re in by ten, changing things significantly. Let\u2019s start off where we left off last time\u2014\n 10 6 (1 million \u2013 1,000,000) \u2013 The amount of dots in that  huge image we finished up with last week. On my computer screen, that image was about 18cm x 450cm = .81 m 2 in area.\n 10 7 (10 million) \u2013 This brings us to a range that includes the number of steps it would take to walk around the Earth (40 million steps). If each of your steps around the Earth were represented by a dot like those from the grids in the last post, the dots would fill a 6m x 6m square.\n 10 8 (100 million) \u2013 Now we\u2019re at the number of books  ever published in human history (130 million), and at the top of this range, the  estimatednumber of words a human being speaks in a lifetime (860 million). Also in this range are the odds of winning the really big lotteries. A recent Mega Millions lottery had 1-in-175,711,536 odds of winning. To put those chances in perspective, that \u2019s about the number of seconds in six years. So it \u2019s like knowing a hedgehog will sneeze once and  ...\n 10 9 (1 billion 1  \u2013 1,000,000,000) \u2013 Here we have the number of seconds in a century (about 3 billion), the number of living humans (7.125 billion), and to fit a billion dots, our dot image would cover two basketball courts.\n 10 10 (10 billion) \u2013 Now we\u2019re up to the years since the Big Bang (13.7 billion) and the number of seconds since Jesus Christ lived (60 billion).\n 10 11 (100 billion) \u2013 This is about the number of stars in the Milky Way and the number of galaxies in the observable universe (100-400 billion)\u2014so if a computer listed one observable galaxy every second since Christ, it wouldn\u2019t be anywhere close to finished currently.\n 10 12 (1 trillion \u2013 1,000,000,000,000) \u2013 A million millions. The amount of pounds the scale would show if you put the whole human race on it (~1 trillion), the number of seconds humans have been around (~100,000 years = ~3 trillion seconds), and larger than both of those totals combined, the number of miles in one light year (6 trillion). A trillion is so big that you\u2019d only need 4 trillion millimeters of ribbon to tie a bow around the sun.\n 10 13 (10 trillion) \u2013 This is about as big as we can get for numbers we hear discussed in the real world, and it\u2019s almost always related to nations and dollars\u2014the US nominal GDP in 2013 was just under $17 trillion, and its debt is currently just under $18 trillion. Both of those are dwarfed by the number of cells in the human body (37 trillion).\n 10 14 (100 trillion) \u2013 100 trillion is about the number of letters in every published book in human history, as well as the number of bacteria in your body. 2 Also in this range is the total wealth of the world ($241 trillion, which we discussed  at great length in a previous post).\n 10 15 (1 quadrillion) \u2013 Okay goodbye normal words. People say the words million, billion, and trillion a lot. No one says quadrillion. It\u2019s really uncool to say the word quadrillion. 3 Most people opt for \u201ca million billion\u201d instead. Either way, there are about a quadrillion  ants on Earth. Comparing this to the bacteria fact, it\u2019s like you have 1/10th of the world\u2019s ants crawling around inside your body.\n 10 16 (10 quadrillion) \u2013 It\u2019s in this range that we get to the number of playing cards you\u2019d have to accidentally knock off the table to cover the entire Earth (89 quadrillion). People would be mad at you.\n 10 17 (100 quadrillion) \u2013 The number of seconds since the Big Bang.  Also the number of references to Kim Kardashian that entered my soundscape in the last week. Please stop.\n 10 18 (1 quintillion) \u2013 Also known as a billion billion, the word quintillion manages to be even less cool than a quadrillion. No one who has social skills ever says the word quintillion. Anyway, it\u2019s the number of cubic meters of water in all the Earth\u2019s oceans and the number of atoms in a grain of salt (1.2 quintillion). The number of grains of sand on every beach on Earth is about 7.5 quintillion\u2014the same number of atoms in  six grains of salt.\n 10 19 (10 quintillion) \u2013 The number of millimeters from here to the closest next star (38 quintillion millimeters).\n 10 20 (100 quintillion) \u2013 The number of meter-long steps it would take you to walk across the whole Milky Way. So many podcasts. And heard of a Planck volume? It\u2019s the smallest volume scientists talk about, so small you could fit 100 quintillion of them in a  proton. More on Planck volumes later. Oh, and our dot image? By the time we get to 600 quintillion dots, the image would cover the surface of the Earth.\n 10 21 (1 sextillion) \u2013 Now we\u2019re even beyond the vocabulary of the weirdos. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard someone say \u201csextillion\u201d out loud, and I hope to keep it that way.\n 10 23 (100 sextillion) \u2013 A rough estimate  for the number of stars in the observable universe. You also had to deal with this number in high school\u2014602 sextillion, or 6.02 x 10 23\u2014is a mole, or Avogadro\u2019s Number, and the number of hydrogen atoms in a gram of hydrogen.\n  10 25 (10 septillion) \u2013 The number of drops of water in all the world\u2019s oceans.\n 10 27 (1 octillion) \u2013 If the Earth were hollow, it would take 1 octillion peas to pack it full. And I think we\u2019ve heard just about enough from octillion.\n Okay so now let\u2019s take a huge leap forward into a whole different territory\u2014somewhere where the Earth\u2019s volume is too tiny and the Big Bang too recent to use in examples. In this new arena of number, only the observable universe\u2014a sphere about 92 billion light years across\u2014can handle the magnitude we\u2019re dealing with. 4 10 80 \u2013 To get to 10 80, you take trillion and you multiply it by a trillion, by a trillion, by a trillion, by a trillion, by a trillion, by a hundred million.  ...\n 10 86 \u2013 And what if you wanted to pack the entire observable universe sphere with peas? You\u2019d need 10 86 peas to make it happen.\n 10 90 \u2013 This is how many medium size grains of sand (.5mm in diameter) it would take to pack the universe full.\n  The name googol came about when American mathematician Edward Kasner got cute one day in 1938 and asked his 9-year-old nephew Milton to come up with a  ...\n I\u2019m using the American short scale system\u2014in the British long scale system, you don\u2019t get to a billion until 10 12. \u21a9\n   I\u2019m going to use the term \u201cuniverse\u201d to refer to the observable universe so I don\u2019t have to type observable 49 times in this post. \u21a9\n 59 years later, Sergey Brin and Larry Page named their new search engine after this number because they wanted to emphasize the large quantities of information the engine could provide. They spelled it wrong by accident. \u21a9\n   Or a g 65 number of years, which would be (3 [Graham\u2019s number of arrows] 3)\u2026or a g g 64 number of years\u2026I could go on. \u21a9", "posttime":

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  De-extinction, also known as  resurrection biology, or  species revivalism, is the process of generating an  organism that is either an extinct species or resembles an  extinct species.  [1] There are several ways to carry out the process of de-extinction.  Cloning is the most widely proposed method, although genome editing and  selective breeding have also been considered. Similar techniques have been applied to certain  endangered species, in hopes to boost populations.  ...\n     Cloning is a commonly suggested method for the potential restoration of an extinct species. It can be done by extracting the nucleus from a preserved cell from the extinct species and swapping it into an egg, without a nucleus, of that species&#39; nearest living relative.  [3]The egg can then be inserted into a host from the extinct species \u2019nearest living relative. It is important to note that this method can only be used when a preserved cell is available,  ...\n  Genome editing has been rapidly advancing with the help of the CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was originally discovered as part of the bacterial immune system.  [6]Viral DNA that was injected into the bacterium became incorporated into the bacterial chromosome at specific regions. These regions are called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, otherwise known as CRISPR. Since the viral DNA is within  ...\n By using cells from a closely related species to the extinct species, genome editing can play a role in the de-extinction process. Germ cells may be edited directly, so that the egg and sperm produced by the extant parent species will produce offspring of the extinct species, or somatic cells may be edited and transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer. This results in a hybrid between the two species, since it is not completely one animal. Because  ...\n  Back breeding is a form of selective breeding. As opposed to breeding animals for a trait to advance the species in selective breeding, back breeding involves breeding animals for an ancestral characteristic that may not be seen throughout the species as frequently.  [7] This method can recreate the traits of an extinct species, but the genome will differ from the original species.  [4]Back breeding, however, is contingent on the ancestral trait of the  ...\n  A natural process of de-extinction is iterative evolution. This process occurs when a species becomes extinct, but then reappears after some amount of time. An example of this process occurred with the  white-throated rail. This flightless bird became extinct approximately 136,000 years ago due to an unknown event that caused sea levels to rise, which resulted in the demise of the species. The species reappeared about 100,000 years ago when sea levels  ...\n  The technologies being developed for de-extinction could lead to large advancements in scientific technology and process. This includes the advancement of genetic technologies that are used to improve the cloning process for de-extinction. The technologies could be used to prevent endangered species form going extinct.  [11]The study of reintroduced spices could also lead to advancements in science. By studying previously extinct animals cures to diseases  ...\n If de-extinction is prioritized it would lead to the improvement of current conservation strategies. Conservation would be necessary in order to reintroduce a species into the ecosystem. Conservation efforts would be taken initially until the revived population can sustain itself in the wild.  [14]De-extinction could also help improve ecosystems that had been destroyed by human development by introducing an extinct species back into an ecosystem to  ...\n  The reintroduction of previously extinct spices could have negative impact on the ecosystem and other species, Since the species was previously extinct reintroducing it into an ecosystem it could be seen as an invasive species. This could lead to the extinction of living species due to competition for food or  competitive exclusion. It could also lead to the extinction of prey species if they have more predictors in an environment that had few predictors  ...\n De-extinction is a very expensive process. Bringing back one species can coast millions of dollars. The money for de-extinction would most likely come from current conservation efforts. These efforts could be weakened if funding is taken from conservation and put into de-extinction. This would mean that  critically endangeredspecies would start to go extinct faster because there is no longer resources that are need to maintain their populations.  ...\n      The existence of preserved soft tissue remains and  DNA from  woolly mammoths has led to the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Two methods have been proposed to achieve this. The first would be to use the cloning process, because even the most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough DNA intact to guide the production of an embryo.  [20]The second method  ...\n In March 2014, the  Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists reported that blood recovered from a frozen mammoth carcass in 2013 would now provide a good opportunity for cloning the woolly mammoth.  [21] Another way to create a living woolly mammoth would be to migrate genes from the mammoth genome into the genes of its closest living relative, the  Asian elephant, to create hybridized animals with the notable adaptations that it had for living  ...\n George Church has hypothesized the positive effects of bringing back the extinct woolly mammoth would have on the environment, such as the potential for reversing some of the damage caused by  global warming.  [26]He and his fellow researchers predict that mammoths would eat the dead grass allowing the sun to reach the spring grass; their weight would allow them to break through dense, insulating snow in order to let cold air reach the soil; and  ...\n  The  Pyrenean ibex was a subspecies of  Spanish ibex that roamed on the Iberian peninsula. While it was abundant up to the  Medieval times, over-hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries led to its demise. In 1999, only a single female named Celia was left alive in  Ordesa National Park. Scientists captured her, took a tissue sample from her ear, collared her, then released her back into the wild, where she lived until she was found dead in 2000, having  ...\n   The  aurochs was widespread across Eurasia, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent during the  Pleistocene, but only the European aurochs (  Bos primigenius primigenius) survived into historic times.  [30] This species is heavily featured in European cave paintings, such as  Lascaux and  Chauvet cave in France,  [31] and was still widespread during the  Roman era. Following the fall of the  Roman empire, overhunting of the aurochs by nobility caused  ...\n  The  quagga ( Equus quagga quagga) is a subspecies of the  plains zebra that was distinct in that it was striped on its face and upper torso, but its rear abdomen was a solid brown. It was native to  South Africa, but was wiped out in the wild due to overhunting for sport, and the last individual died in 1883 in the Amsterdam Zoo.  [38]However, since it is technically the same species as the surviving plains zebra, it has been argued that the quagga  ...\n   The  thylacine was native to the  Australian mainland,  Tasmania and  New Guinea. It is believed to have become  extinct in the 20th century. The thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the  Australian mainland before  British settlement of the continent. The last known thylacine, named Benjamin, died at the  Hobart Zoo, on September 7, 1936. It is believed to have died as the result of neglect \u2014locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters,  ...\n In December 2017 it was announced in  Nature Ecology and Evolution that the full nuclear genome of the thylacine had been successfully sequenced, marking the completion of the critical first step toward de-extinction that began in 2008, with the extraction of the DNA samples from the preserved pouch specimen.  [43] The Thylacine genome was reconstructed by using the genome editing method. The  Tasmanian devilwas used as a reference for the  ...\n   The  passenger pigeonnumbered in the billions before being wiped out due to commercial hunting and habitat loss. The non-profit Revive &amp; Restore obtained DNA from the passenger pigeon from museum specimens and skins; however, this DNA is degraded because it is so old. For this reason, simple cloning would not be an effective way to perform de-extinction for this species because parts of the genome would be missing. Instead, Revive &amp;  ...\n   Moa \u2013 this group of large (up to 4\u00a0m\u00a0[12\u00a0ft] tall and 110\u00a0kg\u00a0[250\u00a0lb]), flightless birds became extinct in approximately 1400 AD following the arrival and proliferation of the  Maori people on New Zealand; however, intact DNA from both preserved specimens and eggshells makes the moa a candidate for resurrection.  [46] [   failed verification] New Zealand politician  Trevor Mallard has suggested bringing back a medium-sized species.  [47]\n Heath hen \u2013 this subspecies of the  prairie chicken became extinct on  Martha&#39;s Vineyard in 1932 despite conservation efforts; however, the availability of usable DNA in museum specimens and protected areas in its former range makes this bird a possible candidate for de-extinction and reintroduction to its former habitat.  [48]\n Dodo \u2013 this large, flightless ground bird endemic to  Mauritius became extinct in the 1640s, less than a century after it was discovered, due to exploitation by humans and due to  introduced speciessuch as rats and pigs, which ate their eggs, and has since become a symbol of extinction in popular culture. Due to a wealth of bones and some tissues, it is possible that this species may live again as it has a close relative in the surviving  ...\n Elephant bird \u2013 of the largest birds to have ever existed, the elephant bird was driven to extinction by the early colonization of Madagascar. Ancient DNA has been obtained from the eggshells but may be too degraded for use in de-extinction.  [51]\n  Cave lion \u2013 The discovery of two preserved cubs in the  Sakha Republic ignited a project to clone the animal.  [52]\n Steppe bison \u2013 The discovery of the mummified steppe bison of 9,000 years ago could help people clone the ancient bison species back, even though the steppe bison would not be the first to be &#34;resurrected&#34;.  [53]\n Tarpan \u2013 A subspecies of wild horse that went extinct in 1909. Much like the aurochs, there have been many attempts to breed tarpan-like horses, the first being by the Heck brothers, creating the  Heck horse as a result. Though it is not a genetic copy, it is claimed to bear many similarities to the tarpan.  [54]Other attempts were made to create tarpan-like horses. A breeder named Harry Hegardt was able to breed a line of horses from  ...\n  Macrauchenia \u2013 The DNA of  Macrauchenia, which has been discovered in 2017, makes it possible for  Macrauchenia to be cloned.  [56]\n  Floreana Island tortoise \u2013 In 2008, mitochondrial DNA from the Floreana tortoise species was found in museum specimens. In theory, a breeding programme could be established to &#34;resurrect&#34; a pure Floreana species from living hybrids.  [57]  [58]\n  Gastric-brooding frog \u2013 In 2013, scientists in Australia successfully created a living embryo from non-living preserved genetic material, and hopes by using somatic-cell nuclear transfer methods, they can produce an embryo that can survive to the tadpole stage.

"note_en": "Microsoft has detailed one more area where it&#39;s engineers are using the Mozilla-created Rust programming language, a new project from a team at Azure to test WebAssembly modules in Kubernetes.\n Microsoft is already experimenting with Rust to  rewrite low-level components of Windows originally written in C and C++, and is also looking to Rust&#39;s memory-safety features to create a new language  for &#39;safe infrastructure programming&#39; under Project Verona.\n    DeisLabs, an Azure incubator for creating Kubernetes tools, has also used Rust to build  Krustlet, a &#39;kubelet&#39; than lets developers run multiple WebAssembly modules (Wasm) in Kubernetes, the dominant open-source tool for managing Docker containers.\n     &#34;While there have been many stories about using Rust for systems-level programming, you don&#39;t often hear stories about cloud software  or Kubernetes software being written in Rust. So, we wanted to explain why we made the choice we did,&#34;  writes Taylor Thomas, a senior software engineer at DeisLabs, Azure.\n The Krustlet project, which  emerged earlier this month, is &#34;highly experimental&#34;, with DeisLabs warning that &#34;you should use it in production at your own risk&#34;.\n   WebAssembly, an open standard supported by all major browsers, has primarily been used for creating powerful web applications that run in the browser. The main reason DeisLabs chose Rust for Krustlet is because Rust has native build support for compiled Wasm binaries or modules.\n But Microsoft is forging ahead with Rust-based Krustlet to help developers push WebAssembly code outside the browser, in support of  Mozilla&#39;s release last year of the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI), so that compilers can target a single interface rather than multiple operating systems.\n Developers can use Krustlet to test-drive WebAssembly modules in Kubernetes alongside containers within &#34;constrained and security-conscious environments&#34; where containers typically are challenged.\n DeisLabs developers also chose Rust because of its &#34;strong safety and security guarantees&#34;. Despite early troubles with Rust that put a drag on productivity they realized they could save time downstream by not exposing null pointers, thread safety issues, and other bugs. And they argue they were able to significantly reduce the efficiency gap between programming in Rust compared with Go.\n &#34;For the first week or so, we lost much of our time to learning how  borrows worked. After about two weeks, we were back up to 50% efficiency compared to us writing in Go. After a month, we all were comfortable enough that we were back up to full efficiency (in terms of how much code we could write),&#34; writes Thomas.\n &#34;However, we noticed that we gained productivity in the sense that we didn&#39;t spend as much time manually checking specific conditions, like null pointers, or not having to debug as many problems.&#34;\n On the issue of security versus missing features in Rust, Thomas highlights a recently discovered race condition in Helm, which was written in Go and was not picked up by the race checker for Go. But, he says, the bug would definitely have been caught by the Rust compiler.\n &#34;Even though we sometimes miss having a garbage collector so we don&#39;t have to worry about cloning, borrowing, ownership, etc., the pain we have avoided because of the Rust compiler&#39;s strict rules is incalculable,&#34; said Thomas.\n &#34;For comparison, last week\u00a0 we caught a significant race condition\u00a0in another Kubernetes-related project we maintain called\u00a0 Helm\u00a0(written in Go) that has been there for a year or more, and which passed the race checker for Go. That error would never have escaped the Rust compiler, preventing the bug from ever existing in the first place.&#34;\n Ralph Squillace, a principal program manager on Azure application platform upstream, said: &#34;Using Rust to build Kubernetes components was a wonderful experience compared to Go, and it should be much more widely adopted for Kubernetes work.&#34;\n  But Thomas said Rust still had obvious problems, including the length of time required to learn it.\n &#34;One of the biggest ones to point out is that async runtimes are still a bit unclear,&#34; noted Thomas. He also said the learning curve was difficult, which chimes with top obstacles to Rust adoption  revealed in Rustlang&#39;s most recent survey of developers.\n &#34;It takes several weeks of hard effort learning how to code properly in Rust before the learning curve levels out. However, that hard effort up front pays off in dividends due to the aforementioned safety features,&#34; said Thomas.\n &#34;We also noticed that once developers are over that initial curve, they are able to contribute to code just as easily as with any other language. Just be aware that there will be some initial pain.&#34;\n Nonetheless, Microsoft&#39;s Azure engineers intend to continue using Rust for projects where it&#39;s a good fit and &#34;highly recommend&#34; it for upcoming cloud projects.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:48:38", "tags": "rust,\u7a0b\u5e8f,\u7f16\u7a0b,app,programming language", "title":

"note_en": "Jitsi is an open source app for videoconferencing and chat. Works with Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and Android clients.\n Droplets created by using this image allow videoconference between Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS users, just requiring to open a new browser tab on laptops/desktops or to install the Jitsi app from the Play Store/App Store on mobile.\n This is a pre-configured image with pre-configured Jitsi and NGINX. Ypu&#39;ll only need a domain and we provide scripts for an effortless setup with HTTPS for secure communication for your team.\n It is recommended to run this image on a  CPU-Optimized droplet with at least 4GB of RAM or higher.\n   Before accessing the fresh droplet, add a domain to your project. This is required because most browsers require HTTPS in order to allow you to use the camera and microphone in a website, and it&#39;s not possible to enable HTTPS just with an IP.\n  It is mandatory to add an A record (i.e. jitsi-example.digitalocean.com) pointing to the IP associated with your droplet.\n  Access the console (i.e via ssh by running  ssh root@123.456.789) and set a new password.\n  We have created scripts to configure Jitsi in a very straightforward way. This is divided in two steps:\n     The menu will ask you to type the domain you added to your project in step 2. Type it exactly the same (i.e. jitsi-example.digitalocean.com), if you insert the droplet IP you  won&#39;t be able to configure HTTPS in the next step.\n Then select the option to generate a self-signed certificate, unless you want import your own certificate.\n    The menu will ask you for an email, it will be used to notify you when it&#39;s time to renew the certificates and maintain your website with a secure connection.\n Here&#39;s an excellent guide if you have questions with respect to HTTPS and encryption:  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04\n  Connect to the host via the hostname you set up in the earlier. Just open a browser tab and visit  jitsi-example.digitalocean.com (i.e. the domain that you previously configured).\n  (Optional) Use SSH keys instead of typed passwords to enter your server via SSH. See the details here:  https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/\n (Optional) Configure an application such as Google Authenticator to provide a dynamic additional password for SSH access. See the details here:  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-protect-ssh-with-two-factor-authentication\n  In addition to creating a Droplet from the Jitsi Server 1-Click App via the control panel, you can also use the   DigitalOcean API.\n As an example, to create a 4GB Jitsi Server Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following curl command. You\u2019ll need to either save your   API access token to an environment variable or substitute it into the command below.\n curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; \\ -H

"note_en": "So it happened again: I feel being patronized by a large SW vendor who forces me to automatically run his software on my system after each login. As an open source developer and advocate I hate if I don\u2019t have control over these kind of things and no option to turn them off. Unix know-how to the rescue, though. Read on.\n The members of a project I am currently working on to make a living are now widespread over the country due to the coronavirus pandemic. Project management has decided that the communication should happen over a product called skype. It\u2019s not free and open, but hey, come on, I have to make some money somehow so that I can manage it with  KMyMoney. Fortunately, I found out that there is a version for Linux and it even works quite well.\n Nevertheless, I wondered why it starts after login without me doing anything. OK, this could be the default setting and I started the  KDE system settings to turn it off. Not thinking about it further, I started and stopped skype for a few days until there was a kernel update and I had to reboot my system.\n After login, I was surprised that skype started automatically. I thought, I had turned it off. Well, unmark that checkbox again in system settings and guess what: it returned without me doing anything except starting and using the application. That  ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop file, which is responsible for the autostart, just re-appeared every time one starts skype manually.\n Using the search engine of choice, I learned that this is a known problem and cannot be turned off with an option. This is the time, when patronization starts and I get angry.\n Visiting a few web pages I learned that people have developed different methods to solve the issue:\n create a directory with the name of the desktop file to avoid creation of the file itself\n and maybe some more I don\u2019t remember. All in all, they are not really what I like on my system.\n Next, I thought they will recreate the file only in case it does not exist. I changed  X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true to  X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false which should do the trick. Guess what: start skype, quit and the setting is back to  true. Changing  Exec=/usr/bin/skypeforlinux to  Exec=/usr/bin/true had the same effect: none.\n This is the moment in time when I really get angry and p\u2026.: I set options and someone else discards them. OK Microsoft, how about the next ace in my sleeve:\n  and that does it. And if you think you can override that in a future version, I will make root the owner of that file.\n Oh, and the Microsoft Teams client for Linux does the same crap but the solution works the same way.\n   As a response to the above blog entry I received a mail that explained how to turn off the autostart using a setting on the General settings tab within skype.

"note_en": "New data from space is providing the most precise picture yet of Antarctica\u2019s ice, where it is accumulating most quickly and disappearing at the fastest rate, and how the changes could contribute to rising sea levels.\n  The information, in a  paper published on Thursday in the journal Science, will help researchers better understand the largest driver of ice loss in Antarctica, the thinning of floating ice shelves that allows more ice to flow from the interior to the ocean, and how that will contribute to rising sea levels. Researchers have known for a long time that, while the continent is  losing mass over all as the climate changes, the change is uneven. It is gaining more ice in some areas, like parts  ...\n Helen A. Fricker, an author of the paper, said that scientists have tried to study the link between thinning shelves and what is called grounded ice, but have been hampered because most observations were of one area or the other, and made at different times. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got it all on the same map, which is a really powerful thing,\u201d said Dr. Fricker, a glaciologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.\n The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2, or ICESat-2, was launched in 2018 as part of NASA \u2019s Earth Observing System. It replaced a satellite that had provided data from 2003 to 2009. ICESat-2 uses a laser altimeter, which fires pulses of photons split into six beams toward the Earth \u2019s surface 300 miles below. Of the trillions of photons in each pulse, only a handful of reflected ones are detected back at the satellite. Extremely precise measurement of these photons \u2019travel times  ...\n \u201cIt\u2019s not like any instrument that we\u2019ve had in space before,\u201d said another of the authors, Alex S. Gardner, a glaciologist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. The resolution is so high that it can detect rifts and other small features of the ice surface, he said.\n The coast of West Antarctica is rapidly losing mass as warm water melts ice shelves from below and icebergs break off.\n   The coast of West Antarctica is rapidly losing mass as warm water melts ice shelves from below and icebergs break off.\n   The coast of West Antarctica is rapidly losing mass as warm water melts ice shelves from below and icebergs break off.\n The researchers used the elevation measurements from both satellites to determine how Antarctica\u2019s mass balance, the difference between accumulation and loss, changed from 2003 to 2019 for each of its 27 drainage basins. Over all, they reported that the continent had lost enough ice to raise sea levels by six millimeters, or about one-quarter of an inch, during that time period.\n While that finding is consistent with other studies that used data from other instruments, \u201cin a lot of ways this is a more definitive measurement,\u201d said Ben Smith, a glaciologist at the University of Washington and an author of the study. \u201cIt shows a set of differences that we can really understand in detail and know what they mean for the ice sheets.\u201d\n Ice loss was limited to West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula; the bigger East Antarctic sheet gained mass over that time. The East Antarctic increase is likely because of increased precipitation, Dr. Gardner said. \u201cWhile we can\u2019t say that these changes are related to contemporary climate change, we can say that these are the patterns of change we expect to see in a warming world,\u201d he said.\n Increased precipitation in the form of snow leads to an increase in ice sheet mass because, as snow compresses over time, it turns to ice.\n Thinning ice shelves in West Antarctica allow ice on land to move toward the ocean, which can raise sea levels.\n   Thinning ice shelves in West Antarctica allow ice on land to move toward the ocean, which can raise sea levels.\n   Thinning ice shelves in West Antarctica allow ice on land to move toward the ocean, which can raise sea levels.\n Floating ice shelves accounted for 30 percent of the ice loss in West Antarctica, the researchers found.\n Floating ice is lost in two ways: by calving of icebergs and through melting from underneath by a deep current of warmer water that circulates around the continent.\n Floating ice is, by definition, already in the water, so when it calves or melts it does not add to sea level rise. But ice shelves act as buttresses against the grounded ice behind them; when they thin they allow that ice to flow faster. And when the previously grounded ice reaches the water, it adds to rising seas.\n Scientists are increasingly concerned that the loss of floating ice in West Antarctica is causing more rapid flow of grounded ice in the West Antarctic ice sheet, and that a portion of the sheet could collapse over centuries, greatly increasing sea levels.\n The study looked at changes in the Greenland ice sheet as well. Unlike Antarctica, where little ice is lost through surface melting and runoff, as much as two-thirds of Greenland\u2019s ice is lost this way.\n Using their elevation data, the researchers found that Greenland is losing about 200 billion tons of mass each year on average. That\u2019s enough to raise sea levels by about eight millimeters, or a third of an inch, over the study period.\n  The study is the first to be published using data from ICESat-2, which was designed to have an operating life of at least three years. Many more studies are expected that should add to the understanding of Earth\u2019s frozen expanses.\n \u201cWhere we\u2019re at in ice sheet science is, there are still a lot of unknowns,\u201d Dr. Gardner said. One advantage of ICESat-2, he said, is its ability to measure changes in some of the smallest ice sheet features.

"note_en": "Scientists working for the  US military have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease, the Guardian has learned.\n In what could be a significant breakthrough, project coordinators hope the blood-based test will be able to detect the virus\u2019s presence as early as 24 hours after infection \u2013 before people show symptoms and several days before a carrier is considered capable of spreading it to other people. That is also around four days before current tests can detect the virus.\n The test has emerged from a project set up by the US military\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) aimed at rapid diagnosis of germ or chemical warfare poisoning. It was hurriedly repurposed when the pandemic broke out and the new test is expected to be put forward for emergency use approval (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within a week.\n \u201cThe concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide,\u201d the head of Darpa\u2019s biological technologies office, Dr Brad Ringeisen, told the Guardian, since it should also fill in testing gaps at later stages of the infection. If given FDA approval, he said, it had the potential to be \u201cabsolutely a gamechanger\u201d.\n  While pre-infectious detection would improve the efficiency of test-and-trace programmes as governments worldwide relax lockdowns, Darpa cautioned that it must wait until after FDA approval is given and the test can be put into practise for evidence of exactly how early it can pick up the virus.\n \u201cThe goal of research is to develop and validate an early host blood response diagnostic test for Covid,\u201d Prof Stuart Sealfon, who leads the research team at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, said in an email.\n He said the testing approach, which looks at the body\u2019s response as it fights Covid-19, should produce earlier results than current nose-swab tests that hunt for the virus itself. \u201cBecause the immune response to infection develops immediately after infection, a Covid signature is expected to provide more sensitive Covid infection diagnosis earlier,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n The research behind the development of the tests will eventually be made public, with the collaborating teams from medical schools at Mount Sinai, Duke University and Princeton expected to publish online, allowing scientists around the world to trial similar methods.\n If EUA is granted, the test should start being rolled out in the US in the second half of May. Approval is not guaranteed, but Darpa scientists are enthusiastic about the potential impact as governments loosen lockdowns amid worries about controlling potential second-wave outbreaks.\n  \u201cWe are all extremely excited. We want to roll this test out as quickly as we can, but at the same time share with others who might want to implement in their own countries,\u201d said Dr Eric Van Gieson, who set up Darpa\u2019s epigenetic characterization and observation (Echo) programme last year to diagnose biological warfare victims, and has redirected it to focus on Covid-19. Epigenetics looks at a set of controls on genes that can respond to the environment.\n Hope that the test might pick up carriers before they become infectious is based on previous research into other viruses, though Sealfon said this remained \u201cunknown\u201d for Covid-19.\n \u201cWe have evidence that diagnosis happens in the first 24 hours for influenza and an adenovirus,\u201d Van Gieson said. \u201cWe are still in the midst of proving that with Covid-19. That said, we should know very soon after EUA.\u201d He sees potential for the US to carry out up to a million tests a day, starting with 100,000 daily in May.\n The test would up up the possibility of isolating pre-infectious cases and closing down transmission chains. It could also dramatically reduce quarantine periods for people exposed to Covid-19 spreaders, allowing them to go back to work within days. \u201cIt could have exceptional demand, \u201dsaid Chris Linthwaite, the chief executive of Fluidigm, a California life-sciences technology company that is part of the project, who believes frequent testing can help manage workforces as they return  ...\n The UK government announced plans two weeks ago to restart a contact-tracing programme that was abandoned early in the outbreak. Britain\u2019s stated target was  100,000   tests a day by the end of April. France announced on Tuesday that it would test 700,000 people a week, including those without symptoms.\n Other countries such as South Korea, Australia and New Zealand already have efficient tracing systems, but they would be boosted if carriers could be detected early.\n  Darpa experts also see potential to improve protocols for protecting health care workers and others in high-risk jobs, as well as those in relatively self-contained or isolated communities such as care homes and prisons or onboard ships.\n The test uses the same polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines used for checking nasal swabs from people suspected of having the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple tweak,\u201d said Van Gieson. \u201cThe infrastructure is already there.\u201d\n Limitations on use are similar to those already faced by countries such as Britain and depend on PCR capacity, stocks of chemical reagents and logistics. Results can take an hour, or longer if samples must be sent away to laboratories.\n Like the viral test, the new blood test hunts for a type of molecule called RNA. In this case it is messenger RNA (mRNA). \u201cTarget mRNA is part of the immune response to viral infection,\u201d Sealfon said. \u201cmRNA expression levels really do adjust due to the presence of Covid-19. Understanding the immune response is key to fighting Covid-19.\u201d\n Covid-19 is thought to incubate for about five days, at which stage people are assumed to become infectious. That is also when the virus can be detected by current nose swab tests. \u201cThey do the job, they just don\u2019t tell you someone is sick until maybe four days after this [new test],\u201d said Van Gieson.\n The research shows accuracy levels above 95%. \u201cThis is something that will need to be constantly monitored as it will inevitably change up or down,\u201d Van Gieson said.\n Blood samples are harder to collect than nose swabs, but may be more reliable. Swab testing can be difficult because it requires taking a sample from deep inside the nose.\n \u201cIt can throw up a lot of false negatives,\u201d said Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University, adding that recent studies showing low reliability were probably due to poor swab sampling. \u201cI\u2019ve been very concerned by pictures on the television of drive-in testing. Something you could measure reliably in blood could be a good thing.\u201d\n  Like all researchers contacted by the Guardian, however, he was unwilling to comment further until the Mount Sinai-led team published its research. Most were concerned about potential problems with accuracy and practicality. Blood collection is a potential limitation, since drive-in centres are not usually equipped to do this. One millilitre of blood \u2013 a fifth of a teaspoon \u2013 is needed.\n The research team is expected to publish the mRNA sequence, allowing others to create the so-called \u201cprimer\u201d required. A similar approach was taken when the genetic sequence of the virus itself was released by China in January, allowing tests to be developed rapidly in South Korea and elsewhere.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:48:09", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u7ec6\u83cc\u6218,warfare,\u68c0\u6d4b", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u7ec6\u83cc\u6218\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5bf9\u611f\u67d3\u524d\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u643a\u5e26\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b", "title_en": "US germ warfare lab creates test for pre-infectious Covid-19 carriers", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/us-germ-warfare-lab-creates-test-for-pre-infectious-covid-19-carriers", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u7ec6\u83cc\u6218", "warfare", "\u68c0\u6d4b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9b1888113ff52a9348afd48ed5319be9.png", "infoid": 1000069, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u6709\u6743\u52bf\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6fc0\u52b1\u4ed6\u4eec\u505a\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u597d\u4e8b\uff0c\u4ece\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5f00\u59cb\u3002", "note_en": "These are the world&#39;s most powerful people.
