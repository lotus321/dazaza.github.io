"note_en": "Apple and Google are undertaking an   unprecedented team effort  to build a system for Androids and iPhones to interoperate in the name of technology-assisted COVID-19 contact tracing.\n The companies\u2019 plan is part of a torrent of proposals to use Bluetooth signal strength to   enhance manual contact tracing with  proximity-based mobile apps . As Apple and Google are an effective duopoly in the mobile operating system space, their plan carries special weight. Apple and Google \u2019s tech would be largely decentralized, keeping most of the data on users \u2019phones and away from central databases. This kind of app has some unavoidable privacy tradeoffs, as we \u2019ll discuss below, and  ...\n Proximity tracking apps might be, at most, a small part of a larger public health response to COVID-19. This use of Bluetooth technology is unproven and untested, and it\u2019s designed for use in smartphone apps that   won\u2019t reach everyone . The apps built on top of Apple and Google \u2019s new system will not be a \u201cmagic bullet \u201dtechnosolution to the current state of shelter-in-place. Their effectiveness will rely on numerous tradeoffs and sufficient trust for widespread public adoption. Insufficient  ...\n  As soon as today , Apple and Google are beginning to roll out parts of the iPhone and Android infrastructure that developers need to be able to build Bluetooth-based proximity tracking apps. If you download one of these apps, it will use your phone \u2019s Bluetooth chip to do what Bluetooth does: emit little radio pings to find other devices. Usually, these pings are looking for your external speakers or wireless mouse. In the case of COVID-19 proximity tracking apps, they will be reaching  ...\n There are now   many   different   proposals   to do basically   this same thing , with slightly different considerations for efficiency, security, and privacy. The rest of this post looks at Apple and Google\u2019s proposal (  version 1.1 ) in particular.\n Each phone will generate a new special-purpose private key each day, known as a \u201ctemporary exposure key.\u201d It will then use that key to generate random identification numbers called \u201crolling proximity identifiers\u201d (RPIDs). Pings will go out at least once every five minutes when Bluetooth is enabled. Each ping will contain the phone\u2019s current RPID, which will change every 10 to 20 minutes. This is meant to reduce the risk that third-party trackers can use the pings to   passively track  ...\n  If an app user learns they are infected, they can grant a public health authority permission to publicly share their temporary exposure keys. In order to prevent people from flooding the system with false alarms, health authorities need to verify that the user is actually infected before they may upload their keys. After they are uploaded, a user \u2019s temporary exposure keys are known as \u201cdiagnosis keys. \u201dThe diagnosis keys are stored in a public registry and available to everyone else  ...\n The diagnosis keys contain all the information needed to re-generate the full set of RPIDs associated with each infected user\u2019s device. Participating apps can use the registry to compare the RPIDs a user has been in contact with against the RPIDs of confirmed COVID-19 carriers. If the app finds a match, the user gets a notification of their risk of infection.\n The program will roll out in two phases. In phase 1, Google and Apple are building a new API into their respective platforms. This API will contain the bare-bones functionality necessary to make their proximity-tracing scheme work on both iPhones and Androids. Other developers will have to build apps that actually execute the new API. Draft specifications for the API have   already been published , and it could be available for developers to use   this week . In phase 2, the companies  ...\n  Several technical and social challenges stand in the way of automated proximity tracking. First, these apps assume that \u201ccell phone = human.\u201d But even in the U.S., cell phone adoption is   far from universal . Elderly people and low-income households are less likely to own smartphones, which could leave out many people at the highest risk for COVID-19. Many older phones   won\u2019t have the technology necessary for Bluetooth proximity tracking. Phones can be turned off, left at home, run  ...\n  Second, proximity tracking apps have to make the profound leap from \u201cthere is a strong Bluetooth signal near me \u201dto \u201ctwo humans are experiencing an epidemiologically relevant contact. \u201dBluetooth technology was not made for this. An app may log a connection when two people wearing masks briefly pass each other on a windy sidewalk, or when two cars with windows up sit next to each other in traffic. The proximity of a patient to a nurse in full PPE may look the same to Bluetooth  ...\n Third, Apple and Google\u2019s proposal currently specifies that phones will broadcast signals as seldom as once every five minutes. So even under otherwise optimal conditions, two phones may not log a contact until they\u2019ve been near each other for the requisite amount of time.\n Fourth, a significant portion of the population must actually use the apps. In Singapore, a government-developed app has only achieved about   20% adoption  after several weeks. As a mobile platform duopoly, Apple and Google are in perhaps the best position possible to encourage the deployment of a new piece of software at scale. Even so, adoption may be slow, and it   will never   be universal .\n  The truth is, nobody really knows how effective proximity tracking apps will be. Further, we need to weigh the potential benefits against the very real risks to privacy and security.\n First, any proximity tracking system that checks a public database of diagnosis keys against RPIDs on a user \u2019s device \u2014as the Apple-Google proposal does \u2014leaves open the possibility that the contacts of an infected person will figure out which of the people they encountered is infected. For example, if you have a contact with a friend, and your friend reports that they are infected, you could use your own device \u2019s contact log to learn that they are sick. Taken to an extreme,  ...\n Second, Apple and Google\u2019s choice to have infected users publicly share their once-per-day diagnosis keys\u2014instead of just their every-few-minute RPIDs\u2014exposes those people to   linkage attacks . A well-resourced adversary could collect RPIDs from many different places at once by setting up static Bluetooth beacons in public places, or by convincing thousands of users to install an app. The tracker will receive a firehose of RPIDs at different times and places. With just the  ...\n  But once a user uploads their daily diagnosis keys to the public registry, the tracker can use them to link together all of that person\u2019s RPIDs from a single day.\n  This can create a map of the user \u2019s daily routine, including where they work, live, and spend time. Such maps are highly unique to each person, so they could be used to identify the person behind the uploaded diagnosis key. Furthermore, they can reveal a person \u2019s home address, place of employment, and trips to sensitive locations like a church, an abortion clinic, a gay bar, or a substance abuse support group. The risk of location tracking is not unique to Bluetooth apps,  ...\n This risk can be mitigated by shortening the time that a single diagnosis key is used to generate RPIDs, at the cost of increasing the download size of the exposure database. Similar projects, like MIT\u2019s   PACT , propose using hourly keys instead of daily keys.\n Third, police may seek data created by proximity apps. Each user \u2019s phone will store a log of their physical proximity to the phones of other people, and thus of their intimate and expressive associations with some of those people, for several weeks. Anyone who has access to the proximity app data from two users \u2019phones will be able to see whether, and on what days, they have logged contacts with each other. This risk is likely inherent to any proximity tracking protocol.  ...\n Apple and Google \u2019s protocol may be susceptible to other kinds of attacks. For example, there \u2019s currently no way to verify that the device sending an RPID is actually the one that generated it, so trolls could collect RPIDs from others and rebroadcast them as their own. Imagine a network of Bluetooth beacons set up on busy street corners that rebroadcast all the RPIDs they observe. Anyone who passes by a \u201cbad \u201dbeacon would log the RPIDs of everyone else who was near  ...\n  Apple and Google \u2019s phase 1 is an API, which leaves it to the rest of the world to develop the actual apps that use the new API. Google and Apple have said they intend \u201cpublic health authorities \u201dto make apps. But most health authorities won \u2019t have the in-house technical resources to do that, so it \u2019s likely they will partner with private companies. Anyone who builds an app on top of the interface will have to do a lot of things right to make sure it \u2019s private and  ...\n Bad-faith app developers may try to tear down the tech giants\u2019 carefully constructed privacy guarantees. For example, although a user\u2019s data is supposed to stay on their device, an app with access to the API might be able to upload everything to a remote server. It could then link daily private keys to a   mobile ad ID  or other identifier, and exploit users\u2019 association history to profile them. It could also use the app as a \u201c  Trojan horse \u201dto convince users to agree  ...\n So, what \u2019s a responsible app developer to do? For starters, they should respect the protocol they \u2019re building on. Developers shouldn \u2019t try to graft a more \u201ccentralized \u201dprotocol, which shares more data with a central authority, on top of Apple and Google \u2019s more \u201cdecentralized \u201dmodel that keeps users \u2019data on their devices. Also, developers shouldn \u2019t share any data over the Internet beyond what is absolutely necessary: just uploading diagnosis keys when an infected  ...\n Developers should be extremely up-front with their users about what data the app is collecting and how to stop it. Users should be able to stop and start sharing RPIDs at any time. They also should be able to see the list of the RPIDs they\u2019ve received, and delete some or all of that contact history.\n  Equally important is what not to do. This is a public health crisis, not a chance to grow a startup. Developers should not force users to   sign up for an account  for anything. Also, they shouldn\u2019t ship a contact tracing app with extra, unnecessary features. The app should do its job and get out of the way, not try to onboard users to a new service.\n Obviously, proximity tracing apps shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with ads (and the   exploitative, data-sucking mess  that comes with them). Likewise, they shouldn\u2019t use   analytics libraries  that share data with third parties. In general, developers should use strong, transparent technical and policy safeguards to wall this data off to COVID-19 purposes and only COVID-19 purposes.\n The whole system depends on trust. If users don \u2019t trust that an app is working in their best interests, they will not use it. So developers need to be as transparent as possible about how their apps work and what risks are involved. They should publish source code and documentation so that tech-savvy users and independent technologists can check their work. And they should invite security audits and penetration testing from professionals to be as confident as  ...\n All of this will take time. There\u2019s a lot that can go wrong, and too much is at stake to afford rushed, sloppy software. Public health authorities and developers should take a step back and make sure they get things right. And users should be wary of any apps that ship out in the days following Apple and Google\u2019s first API release.\n   During the first phase,   Apple and Google have said that the API can \u201conly [be] used for contact tracing by public health authorities apps, \u201dwhich \u201cwill receive approval based on a specific set of criteria designed to ensure they are only administered in conjunction with public health authorities, meet our privacy requirements, and protect user data. \u201dApple and Google should be transparent and specific about exactly what these criteria are. Through these criteria,  ...\n In the second phase, the companies will build the proximity tracking technology directly into Android and iOS. This means that no app will be needed initially, though Apple and Google   propose that the user be prompted to download an public health app if an exposure match is detected. All of the recommendations for app developers above also apply to Apple and Google here. Critically, the promised opt-in must obtain specific, informed consent from each user before  ...\n  Finally, this program must sunset when the COVID-19 crisis is over. Proximity tracking apps should not be repurposed for other things, like tracking more mild seasonal flu outbreaks or finding witnesses to a crime. Google and Apple have said that they \u201ccan disable the exposure notification system on a regional basis when it is no longer needed. \u201dThis is an important ability, and Apple and Google should establish a clear, concrete plan for when to end this  ...\n There will be no quick tech solution to COVID-19.

Wondering what the right moment is to start with learning code.\n  11 and 8. I think the right moment = when they actively want to learn to program.My 11 yo definitely does and had been nagging me for a while to teach him. I could probably teach the 8 yo to program too, but I&#39;m waiting till he wants me to.\n  \u65b0\u5bf9\u8bdd  I&#39;m curious why didn&#39;t you teach them a better language? E.g., Python could express this in a much simpler and more beautiful way.\n  \u65b0\u5bf9\u8bdd  Is there an article where you explain what this is and how to use it?\n  If you click on the green &#34;run&#34; button at the top of the screen, it will print instructions.\n  \u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ed3\u675f\n  In classic Basic, every line has to have a line number.

Sometimes, packets go in circles.Other times, 1/8 of the (IPv4) Internet gets caught up in a bad route.\n Those are temporary things. Today&#39;s story of pain and suffering is one of those things which tends to stick around for a very long time. And, as a bonus, there&#39;s a way for evil readers (or just people with  really bad attitudes) to find out if their own company is one of these.\n Here&#39;s the basic premise: if you give someone your wireless network name and WPA2 passphrase (&#34;pre-shared key&#34;, if you must), they can get on your network. You knew that already. What you might not have realized is that they can now create a perfect clone of the network. Most of us don&#39;t actually have that &#34;threat model&#34; to worry about with our homes, and so giving out login details to friends is not a problem.\n Companies don&#39;t have that option. Our beekeeping friendsfrom a previous story and many others like them have a life-or-death struggle going on, particularly now that the world is caught up in this whole Twilight Zone quarantine thing. Some of them would totally do nefarious stuff to find out what the other one is up to... and have.\n But, you say, companies aren&#39;t supposed to be in that situation! They&#39;re supposed to be using the &#34;enterprise&#34; versions of this wifi stuff where you have network certificates and client certificates and actually use login names and passwords and RADIUS and stuff like that! I agree with you, companies  aren&#39;t supposed to be in that situation. Of course they aren&#39;t. But they tend to be there more often than you might think.\n Think about it. If your company would turn off STP and induce a business-ending switch loop just to fix the toilet tunes (literally, music in the bathrooms), would it run a coffee-shop grade wirelessnetwork? You better believe they would. (And apologies to actual coffee shops.)\n How can you prove it? That&#39;s easy. Grab your corporate Mac and fire up Keychain Access. Then go over to Category, pick Passwords, and sort by Kind. Then look for &#34;network password&#34;. Look for the usual network name that your Mac would be on when you&#39;re at the office. (I get that almost nobody is there right this moment due to the craziness. Go with me here.)\n Do you see an entry in there? Try opening it. There&#39;ll be a form that pops up with a little check box to display the password. Does it work? It might ask you for your login credentials, and then does it accept them and show them to you? That&#39;s the whole company&#39;s wifi password. Every single device is probably configured with it. This could be thousands or tens of thousands of machines across dozens or hundreds of physical locations.\n  Now here&#39;s where the real fun comes in. With that information, you or anyone else could grab any access point made in the past few years and configure a network with the same settings, down to the SSID (network name) and passphrase. If you then turned it on and left it near a device configured for your company network, there is a very good chance you would &#34;capture&#34; it.\n What now? Use your imagination. Spoof DNS. Set up phony web sites that look like vendors they are likely to use. Run fake login pages.\n &#34;But we use https&#34;, you think. Sure you do, sometimes. But I bet you can find something goofy that doesn&#39;t, or where someone&#39;s browser hasn&#39;t found out that site prefers https yet. Remember, all you really need to do is convince one person to type their credentials into your fake page, and now you can go in and explore much more.\n Imagine doing this on a rush-hour Caltrain or BART car where a bunch of people from the targeted company are commuting. Their phones would normally use the cellular, but if presented with a matching wireless network, would probably hop on it, particularly in the tunnels.\n This is why we don&#39;t use home grade wifi setups for multi-million-dollar businesses, assuming we want them to remain multi-million-dollar businesses and not a smoking crater of Aeron chairs. If this is your company, go scream at your IT people until they do something about it. Then consider finding a way onto the hard-wired network and stop using the company wireless network by default until they fix it.\n If they go &#34;oh yeah, we know&#34; when you show up, ask them how long they have known about it. Their answer should tell you whether there&#39;s any chance of it ever being fixed.\n  Bonus tip: try searching your intranet or even the public Internet for the password you find. If you find it on a public wiki page, send out for some stiff liquor.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 05:26:32", "tags": "\u4f01\u4e1a,times,network", "title": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e0d\u666f\u6c14", "title_en": "Bad times in corporate wireless networks", "transed": 1, "url": "https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/05/01/owned/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u4f01\u4e1a", "times", "network"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7f02c758e562421b9595746604d8887f.jpg", "infoid": 1000415, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8363\u667a\u5065\u8ba4\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u4e2a\u5e78\u8fd0\u513f\u3002\u8363\u667a\u5065\u662f\u4e00\u540d1848\u5e74\u79fb\u6c11\u5230\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5fb7\u56fd\u4eba\uff0c\u4ed6\u52aa\u529b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u8c0b\u751f\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u4e00\u5bb6\u505c\u5c38\u623f\u7684\u8001\u677f\u81f4\u5bcc\u3002\u8fd9\u7b14\u751f\u610f\u8ba9\u4ed6\u548c\u59bb\u5b50\u7f57\u897f\u5a1c\u5728\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u8857\u5c71\u7684\u5c71\u9876\u4e70\u4e86\u4e00\u5757\u4e0d\u8d77\u773c\u7684\u5730\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u4ed6\u4eec\u5efa\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u5ea7\u53e4\u8272\u53e4\u9999\u7684\u5e73\u623f\u5f0f\u4f4f\u5b85\uff0c\u5e76\u79cd\u690d\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u82b1\u56ed\u3002\u6bcf\u5929\uff0c\u52a0\u5dde\u7684\u9633\u5149\u548c\u65b0\u9c9c\u7a7a\u6c14\u90fd\u4f1a\u4ece\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7a97\u6237\u91cc\u6d8c\u5165\u3002\n\u8363\u683c\u6ca1\u6709\u7406\u7531\u76f8\u4fe1\u4efb\u4f55\u4e8b\u60c5\u90fd\u4f1a\u6253\u65ad\u4ed6\u7530\u56ed\u8bd7\u822c\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u7406\u7531\u76f8\u4fe1\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u4f1a\u4ee5\u67d0\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u5265\u593a\u4ed6\u8f9b\u8f9b\u82e6\u82e6\u4eab\u53d7\u7684\u7f8e\u597d\u65f6\u5149\u3002\u4f46\u8363\u683c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u5230\u67e5\u5c14\u65af\u00b7\u514b\u7f57\u514b(Charles Crocker)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u5bcc\u6709\u548c\u975e\u5e38\u5c0f\u6c14\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u65e2\u6210\u4e3a\u4ed6\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\uff0c\u4e5f\u6210\u4e3a\u4ed6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7978\u6839\u3002\u6709\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6728\u6750\u5728\u8363\u683c\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8d22\u4ea7\u5468\u56f4\u7b51\u8d7740\u82f1\u5c3a\u9ad8\u7684\u6805\u680f\uff0c\u514b\u7f57\u514b\u548c\u4ed6\u7684\u6028\u6068\u6805\u680f\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f20\u5947\u7684\u590d\u4ec7\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c.", "note_en": "Nicholas Yung considered himself a lucky man.

"note_en": "10 min read   My wife is big fan of Animal Crossing. I will admit that I mostlydon\u2019t understand the game but I find it very cute. She was very upset acouple of days ago when the Bank of Nook decided to cut the interestrate down to 0.05%, at which point she asked: \u201chow am I supposed tomake money now!?\u201d\n  It seems there\u2019s some sort of turnip market in the game. Basically,you can buy turnips on Sunday for a given price, and then you willhave opportunities to sell your turnips over the upcoming week. If youdon\u2019t sell them by next Sunday, you lose them (and thus materializeyour loss). You get two screen prices every day, one in the AM and onein the PM. So, you\u2019ll get 12 prices from Monday to Saturday.\n   The first question is: are turnip prices completely random? A coupleof Google searches reveal that they follow four patterns:\n  Ok, so it seems it\u2019s not completely random. In that case, we should beable to come up with a model (probabilities) for the turnip prices. Itturns out that Ninjihas already looked into the source code and figured out how thepatterns are allocated and how the prices come up. Also, TurnipProphet has already taken this andbuilt a procedure to get the probability distribution for the turnipprices.\n   Every turnip investor (speculator) has to make 12 decisions: how manyturnips to sell at every screen price. Evidently, every turnipinvestor (speculator) has a different risk appetite: I might bewilling to hold on to my turnips for longer looking for a higherpayout which might be unlikely given our probability distribution,or maybe I am not so fond of risk and I hedge my bets out as soon asthings get tough. That\u2019s all okay.\n Turns out this is all part of what we now know as  Modern PortfolioTheory (thanksMr. Markowitz). You have some risky assets, you have a risk appetite,you want to make a well diversified portfolio that minimizes thevariance of your returns, and maximizes your expected returns. Thatsounds like what we want, let\u2019s do that.\n We will model our turnips as 12 different assets: turnips we will sellon Monday AM, turnips we will sell on Monday PM, and so on. Thanks tothe work that has been done in the previous section, we know what\u2019sthe expected return of each of our 12 assets. As time progresses wewill materialize some earnings and some losses.\n Let\u2019s work with an example. I put down my turnip prices on WednesdayPM having sold zero turnips so far. TurnipProphet and got the followingprobability distribution:\n  I was too lazy to get the code for TurnipProphet to run, so I justcopy pasted it and played around with it manually:\n from collections  import defaultdict from functools  import partial import numpy  as np import pandas  as pd import scipy.optimize  as scoMONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY  = range( 6)AM, PM  =  &#34;AM&#34;,  &#34;PM&#34; def  convert_range_with_price(p, s): a, b  = s .split( &#34;to&#34;) a  = a .strip() b  = b .strip()  return list(range(int(a)  - p, int(b)  +  1  - p))turnip_price  =  98convert_range  = partial(convert_range_with_price, turnip_price)data  = [ (  0.664, { (WEDNESDAY, PM):  ...\n So, now we have our data variable holding the probability of eachpossible return (i.e. price we might get minus the price we paid forthe turnips). We can easily calculate the expectation of each asset:\n def  expectation_of(r1): exp  =  0  for p, items  in data: n  = float(len(items[r1])) exp  += (p  * sum(items[r1]))  / n  return exp\n I just assumed that if TurnipProphet says a price range of 51 to 55with 5%, 51 would have a 1% chance of happening, 52 would have a 1%chance of happening. That might obviously be wrong.\n So, going back to Markowitz, what we are interested in doing is comingup with a vector of weights for each asset (e.g. sell 50% of yourturnips on Friday PM) that is within our risk appetite (higher riskappetite means I am willing to take more risk for higher payout). Wewould like those weights to stick to the following optimizationproblem (thanks to the Wikipedia):\n    Ok that seems simple enough, we already know how to compute theexpected returns, let\u2019s build the covariance matrix:\n def  joint_prob(r1, r2): prob  = defaultdict(float)  for p, items  in data: r1_opts  = items[r1] r2_opts  = items[r2] outcomes  = float(len(r1_opts)  * len(r2_opts))  for x  in r1_opts:  for y  in r2_opts: prob[x, y]  += p  / outcomes  return prob def  covariance_of(r1, r2): E_r1  = expectation_of(r1) E_r2  = expectation_of(r2) joint  = joint_prob(r1, r2) joint_exp  =  0  for (x, y), prob  in joint .items(): joint_exp  += x  * y  * prob  return joint_exp  - E_r1  * E_r2\n We are going to calculate the joint probability distribution of thescreen prices at two different times (e.g. what\u2019s the probability thatthe price is X on Monday PM and Y on Friday PM). Using that we use thewell known covariance identity Cov(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]. Presto.\n Let\u2019s get all our turnips in a row now. We want to come up with thatvector of weights. We have an optimization problem here, we want toselect the weights that minimize the formula above. Turns out, we canuse scipy just for that.\n def  objective(weights, covs, expected_returns, risk):  # the `@` operator is matrix multiplication  return weights  @ covs  @ weights  - risk  * expected_returns  @ weights def  get_weights(data, possibilities, risk): num_assets  = len(possibilities) expected_returns_dict  = {}  for p  in poss: expected_returns_dict[p]  = expectation_of(p) er  = pd .DataFrame({ &#34;returns&#34;: expected_returns_dict}) cov_dict  = defaultdict(dict)  for x  in poss:  for y  in poss: cov_dict[x][y]  =covariance_of(x,  ...\n  In [171]: poss = [ ...: (WEDNESDAY, PM), ...: (THURSDAY, AM), ...: (THURSDAY, PM), ...: (FRIDAY, AM), ...: (FRIDAY, PM), ...: (SATURDAY, AM), ...: (SATURDAY, PM), ...: ] ...:In [172]: w, exp, covs = get_weights(data, poss, 0)In [173]: w[&#39;x&#39;]Out[173]:array([9.99973926e-01, 2.60740769e-05, 0.00000000e+00, 0.00000000e+00, 1.71303943e-17, 0.00000000e+00, 0.00000000e+00])In [174]: exp.T @ w[&#39;x&#39;]Out[174]: array([-31.99986786])In [174]: exp.T @ w[&#39;x&#39;]Out[174]:  ...\n Unsurprisingly, if we are willing to take zero risk, we are told to tosell now as that price has zero variance. The expected returns of thatallocation is losing -32 for each turnip. Let\u2019s try a couple ofdifferent risk appetites:\n In [186]: for risk in (10, 50, 100, 250, 500): ...: w, exp, covs = get_weights(data, poss, risk) ...: print(w) ...: print(exp.T @ w[&#39;x&#39;]) ...: print(w[&#39;x&#39;] @ covs @ w[&#39;x&#39;]) ...: fun: 311.77365532878 jac: array([320. , 341.42121124, 346.91123962, 320.00033188, 320.00043488, 441.86499786, 514.03258133]) message: &#39;Optimization terminated successfully.&#39; nfev: 68 nit: 6 njev: 6 status: 0 success: True x: array([9.72724596e-01, 1.01876057e-10,  ...\n So what are we observing? As our risk appetite increases, our weightsshift from \u201ccash out now\u201d to \u201cwait it out till Friday because that\u2019swhen the prices could peak\u201d, we see our expected returns steadilyincrease. However, this comes at a cost: the variance of our portfolioincreased considerably, thus we are taking on a lot more risk (andpossibility to both gain more and lose more).\n Ideally, the way you use this is that every time you have a new screenprice, you\u2019ll update your portfolio.\n On Monday AM price you\u2019ll have a new portfolio. You possibly willsell some at the current price, and have the remaining turnipshanging around.\n On Monday PM price you\u2019ll recompute the weights. You can\u2019t changewhat you already sold, that ship has gone. But you can make animproved decision (because you have more information) to update theweights of the remaining 11 decisions. You will, again, decide tosell some and keep some given your risk appetite.\n Continue until you exhaust your weekly turnips. Or evidently, yourbest friend tells you they have killer prices on their island.\n  There\u2019s an interesting scenario I didn\u2019t get to investigate but Ithink makes for a cool problem which is very similar. Every island hasa different turnip price, so turnips are more valuable in some placesthan others. Let\u2019s say you have access to many islands and access totheir turnip probability distribution.

made a computer model of coordinated animal motion such asbirdflocks and fish schools. It was based on three dimensionalcomputationalgeometry of the sort normally used in computer animation or computeraideddesign. I called the generic simulated flocking creatures boids.The basic flocking model consists of three simple steering behaviors which describe how anindividualboid maneuvers based on the positions and velocities its nearbyflockmates:\n  Each boid has direct access to the whole scene&#39;s geometric description,butflocking requires that it reacts only to flockmates within a certainsmallneighborhood around itself. The neighborhood is characterized by a distance (measured from the center of the boid) and an  angle,measured from the boid&#39;s direction of flight. Flockmates outside thislocalneighborhood are ignored. The neighborhood could be considered a modeloflimited perception (as by fish in murky water) but it is probably morecorrectto  ...\n  A slightly more elaborate behavioral model was used in the earlyexperiments.It included predictive obstacle avoidance and goal seeking. Obstacleavoidance allowed the boids to fly through simulated environments whiledodging static objects. For applications in computer animation, a lowpriority goal seeking behavior caused the flock to follow a scriptedpath.\n  In cooperation with many coworkers at the Symbolics Graphics DivisionandWhitney / Demos Productions, we made an animated short featuring theboidsmodel called  Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice. This filmwas first shown at the Electronic Theater at SIGGRAPH &#39;87. There was a technical paper on boidspublished atthe same conference. In the course notes for SIGGRAPH &#39;88 there was an informal paper about obstacle avoidance.\n Since 1987 there have been many other applications of the boids modelin therealm of  behavioral animation. The 1992TimBurton film  Batman Returns was the first. It contained computer simulated batswarmsand penguin flocks which were created with modified versions of theoriginalboids software developed at Symbolics. Andy Kopra(then at VIFX )produced realisticimagery of bat swarms. Andrea Losch (then at Boss Films) and PaulAshdowncreated animation of an &#34;army&#34; of penguins marching through the  ...\n  As luck would have it,  Chris Langtonorganized the original ground-breaking  Artificial Life Workshop a few months after the boids paper waspublishedin 1987. A helpful go-between got word to Chris and he let me give aninformal presentation on boids at the Workshop. Theboidsmodel has become an oft-cited example of principles of ArtificialLife. Flocking is a particularly evocative example of  emergence:wherecomplex global behavior can arise from the interaction of simple localrules.\n In the boids model   interactionbetweensimple behaviors of individuals produce complex yet organized groupbehavior.The component behaviors are inherently nonlinear, so mixing them givestheemergent group dynamics a chaotic aspect. At the same time, thenegativefeedback provided by the behavioral controllers tends to keep the groupdynamics ordered. The result is  life-like group behavior.\n A significant property of life-like behavior is  unpredictabilityovermoderate time scales. For example at one moment, the boids in theappletabove might be flying primarily from left to right. It would be all butimpossible to predict which direction they will be moving (say) fiveminuteslater. At very short time scales the motion is quite predictable: onesecondfrom now a boid will be traveling in approximately the same direction.Thisproperty is unique to complex systems and contrasts with both  ...\n The boids model is an example of an  individual-basedmodel, a class of simulation used to capture the global behavior ofalarge number of interacting autonomous agents. Individual-based modelsarebeing used in biology, ecology, economics and other fields of study.\n Note that the straightforward implementation of the boids algorithm hasanasymptotic complexity of O(n ). Each boidneeds toconsider each other boid, if only to determine if it is not a  nearbyflockmate. However it is possible to reduce this cost down tonearly O(n)by the use of a suitable  spatial data structurewhich allowsthe boidsto be kept sorted by their location. Finding the nearby flockmates of agivenboid then requires examining only the portion of the flock which iswithin thegeneral vicinity.  ...\n    A summary of  Flocks,Herds, and Schools in the report on  ArtificialLife in  ComputerAnimation in the  HyperGraph project of the ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee.\n  Books and articles that describe boids  Its Alive&#34;Scientists play god in a binary universe of their own making&#34; (1998)by Curt Suplee\n        TheAdaptive Behavior Approach to Psychology (2000) by  Bram Bakkerdescribes adaptive behavior, including boids, for a cognitivepsychology audience.

"note_en": "There are few more important inventions in the history of the world than the radio.\n While in recent years it may have become less popular than television or the internet, it could be argued that the radio was the first electronic gadget to play a prominent part in people&#39;s lives.\n  Radio is where the world first heard Britain declare war on Germany, where Orson Welles accidentally fooled the public into believing a real alien invasion was under way in his &#34;War Of The Worlds&#34; serial and where young people first heard Billy Haley&#39;s &#34;Rock Around The Clock,&#34; spreading popular music around the world.\n  But it is not just an aural medium. Like all important pieces of technology, design has had an essential part to play in its evolution.\n  Within the radio&#39;s changing form over the years you can learn plenty about 20th century modern design.\n From the giant mahogany chests of the early days to the kitsch Bush models of the 1950s, Panasonic ghetto blasters to chunky Sony in-car stereos and up to today, where radio is so often just an app on a laptop or a phone.\n Celebrating this connection between design and radio is a new exhibition at the  Cooper Hewitt museum in New York.\n  Entitled &#34; The World Of Radio,&#34; it tells the story of how the design world impacted this every day item, and the importance of radio in people&#39;s lives.\n &#34;Radio really became a way of broadening one&#39;s personal world,&#34; says Cynthia Trope, Associate Curator at Cooper Hewitt. &#34;You could link to the rest of the world through entertainment broadcasts, news broadcasts... almost instantaneously.&#34;\n  From the offset, the look of a radio was as important as the information they brought into people&#39;s living rooms: &#34;Aside from being just a broadcast system, radio had to have an appeal to the domestic market, because it was used in people&#39;s homes,&#34; says Trope.\n &#34;Tabletop radios and larger pieces really had to work within interiors, they had to become part of the environment.&#34;\n As times moved on, the look and size of radios changed dramatically with new developments in materials and electronics.\n  &#34;When they first started they were viewed more in terms of available materials, often in wooden cases, looking back to a historicist style. But by the 1930s, new materials like plastics really played a part. They were tough but they could also be molded, reflecting a modern, streamlined approach to this new technology.&#34;\n  For Trope, the changes in radio reflect not only advances in technology, but also the times, taking influence from architecture and art, as well as scientific developments.\n &#34;There&#39;s a wonderful skyscraper radio that dates back to the 1930s. It&#39;s very art deco and really looks towards the architecture of its time for inspiration. There&#39;s also the Sapper &amp; Zanuso TS502 from 1964, which came in all sorts of bright colors. The TR620 portable pocket radio by Sony is a personal favorite, it really reduced the size and made radio a really personal device that could fit in a pocket.&#34;\n  It&#39;s in these early portable radios, such as the TR620 that you start to see the genesis of much of today&#39;s technology.\n &#34;Transistors allowed the miniaturization of these forms, so they could really become personal devices. This goes through to later devices like MP3 players, phones and other really small devices that we carry today. These developments in radio technology really made all that possible.&#34;\n As radio becomes little more than an icon on a homescreen, web player, or Soundcloud link, the pieces featured in this exhibition take on a kind of poignancy: relics from an era when entertainment was so often a combination of sound and our own imagination.\n &#34;The World of Radio&#34; is on at the Cooper Hewitt museum in New York until Sept. 24, 2017.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 05:03:29", "tags": "\u6536\u97f3\u673a,secret,radio", "title":

"note_en": "At WWDC 2015, in a very influential session titled   Protocol-Oriented Programming in Swift, Dave Abrahams explained how Swift\u2019s protocols can be used to overcome some shortcomings of classes. He suggested this rule: \u201cDon\u2019t start with a class. Start with a protocol\u201d.\n To illustrate the point, Dave described a protocol-oriented approach to a primitive drawing app. The example worked from a few of primitive shapes:\n protocol  Drawable  {} struct  Polygon :  Drawable  {  var  corners :  [ CGPoint ]  =  [] } struct  Circle :  Drawable  {  var  center :  CGPoint  var  radius :  CGFloat } struct  Diagram :  Drawable  {  var  elements :  [ Drawable ]  =  [] }\n  The reference semantics of objects add complexity when passing objects around. Changing a property of an object in one place can affect other code that has access to that object. Concurrency requires locking, which adds tons of complexity.\n Reusing code via inheritance is fragile. Inheritance also couples interfaces to implementations, which makes reuse more difficult. This is its own topic, but even OO programmers will tell you to prefer \u201ccomposition over inheritance\u201d.\n With subclasses, it\u2019s difficult to precisely identify types. e.g. with  NSObject.isEqual(), you must be careful to only compare against compatible types. Protocols work with generics to precisely identify types.\n To handle the actual drawing, a  Renderer protocol was added that describes the primitive drawing operations:\n protocol  Renderer  {  func  move ( to  p :  CGPoint )  func  line ( to  p :  CGPoint )  func  arc ( at  center :  CGPoint ,  radius :  CGFloat ,  startAngle :  CGFloat ,  endAngle :  CGFloat ) }\n  protocol  Drawable  {  func  draw ( _  renderer :  Renderer ) } extension  Polygon  :  Drawable  {  func  draw ( _  renderer :  Renderer )  {  renderer . move ( to :  corners . last !)  for  p  in  corners  {  renderer . line ( to :  p )  }  } } extension  Circle  :  Drawable  {  func  draw ( renderer :  Renderer )  {  renderer . arc ( at :  center ,  radius :  radius ,  startAngle :  0.0 ,  endAngle :  twoPi )  } } extension  Diagram  :  Drawable  {  func  draw ( renderer :  Renderer )  {  for  f  in  elements  {  f . draw ( renderer )  }  } }\n This made it possible to define different renderers that worked easily with the given types. A main selling point was the ability to define a test renderer, which let you verify drawing by comparing strings:\n struct  TestRenderer  :  Renderer  {  func  move ( to  p :  CGPoint )  {  print ( &#34;moveTo( \\( p . x ) ,  \\( p . y ) )&#34; )  }  func  line ( to  p :  CGPoint )  {  print ( &#34;lineTo( \\( p . x ) ,  \\( p . y ) )&#34; )  }  func  arc ( at  center :  CGPoint ,  radius :  CGFloat ,  startAngle :  CGFloat ,  endAngle :  CGFloat )  {  print ( &#34;arcAt( \\( center ) , radius:  \\( radius ) ,&#34;  +  &#34; startAngle:  \\( startAngle ) , endAngle:  \\( endAngle ) )&#34; )  } }\n  extension  CGContext  :  Renderer  {  // CGContext already has `move(to: CGPoint)`  func  line ( to  p :  CGPoint )  {  addLine ( to :  p )  }  func  arc ( at  center :  CGPoint ,  radius :  CGFloat ,  startAngle :  CGFloat ,  endAngle :  CGFloat )  {  addArc (  center :  center ,  radius :  radius ,  startAngle :  startAngle ,  endAngle :  endAngle ,  clockwise :  true  )  } }\n  extension  Renderer  {  func  circle ( at  center :  CGPoint ,  radius :  CGFloat )  {  arc ( at :  center ,  radius :  radius ,  startAngle :  0 ,  endAngle :  twoPi )  } }\n I think that approach is pretty compelling. It\u2019s much more testable. It also allows us to interpret the data differently by providing separate renderers. And value types neatly sidestep a number of problems that an object-oriented version would have.\n  Despite the improvements, logic and side effects are still tightly coupled in the protocol-oriented version.  Polygon.draw does 2 things: it converts the polygon into a number of lines and then renders those lines. So when it comes time to test the logic, we need to use  TestRenderer\u2014which, despite what the WWDC talk implies, is a mock.\n extension  Polygon  :  Drawable  {  func  draw ( _  renderer :  Renderer )  {  renderer . move ( to :  corners . last !)  for  p  in  corners  {  renderer . line ( to :  p )  }  } }\n We can separate logic and effects here by turning them into separate steps. Instead of the  Renderer protocol, with  move,  line, and  arc, let\u2019s declare value types that represent the underlying operations.\n enum  Path :  Hashable  {  struct  Arc :  Hashable  {  var  center :  CGPoint  var  radius :  CGFloat  var  startAngle :  CGFloat  var  endAngle :  CGFloat  }  struct  Line :  Hashable  {  var  start :  CGPoint  var  end :  CGPoint  }  // Replacing `arc(at: CGPoint, radius: CGFloat, startAngle: CGFloat, endAngle: CGFloat)`  case  arc ( Arc )  // Replacing `move(to: CGPoint)` and `line(to: CGPoint)`  case  line ( Line ) }\n Now, instead of calling those methods,  Drawables can return a set of  Paths that are used to draw them:\n protocol  Drawable  {  var  paths :  Set &lt; Path &gt;  {  get  } } extension  Polygon  :  Drawable  {  var  paths :  Set &lt; Path &gt;  {  return  Set ( zip ( corners ,  corners . dropFirst ()  +  corners . prefix ( 1 ))  . map ( Path . Line . init )  . map ( Path . line ))  } } extension  Circle  :  Drawable  {  var  paths :  Set &lt; Path &gt;  {  return  [. arc ( Path . Arc ( center :  center ,  radius :  radius ,  startAngle :  0.0 ,  endAngle :  twoPi ))]  } } extension  Diagram  :  Drawable  {  var  paths :  Set &lt; Path &gt;  {  return  elements  . map  {  $0 . paths  }  . reduce ( into :  Set  ...\n  extension  CGContext  {  func  draw ( _  arc :  Path . Arc )  {  addArc (  center :  arc . center ,  radius :  arc . radius ,  startAngle :  arc . startAngle ,  endAngle :  arc . endAngle ,  clockwise :  true  )  }  func  draw ( _  line :  Path . Line )  {  move ( to :  line . start )  addLine ( to :  line . end )  }  func  draw ( _  paths :  Set &lt; Path &gt;)  {  for  path  in  paths  {  switch  path  {  case  let  . arc ( arc ):  draw ( arc )  case  let  . line ( line ):  draw ( line )  }  }  } }\n  extension  Path  {  static  func  circle ( at  center :  CGPoint ,  radius :  CGFloat )  -&gt;  Path  {  return  . arc ( Path . Arc ( center :  center ,  radius :  radius ,  startAngle :  0 ,  endAngle :  twoPi ))  } }\n This works just the same as before and requires roughly the same amount of code. But we\u2019ve introduced a boundary that lets us separate two parts of the system. That boundary lets us:\n We don\u2019t need  TestRenderer anymore. We can verify that a  Drawable will be drawn correctly testing the values return from its  paths property.  Path is  Equatable, so this is a simple test.\n let  polygon  =  Polygon ( corners :  [( x :  0 ,  y :  0 ),  ( x :  6 ,  y :  0 ),  ( x :  3 ,  y :  6 )]) let  paths :  Set &lt; Path &gt;  =  [  . line ( Line ( from :  ( x :  0 ,  y :  0 ),  to :  ( x :  6 ,  y :  0 ))),  . line ( Line ( from :  ( x :  6 ,  y :  0 ),  to :  ( x :  3 ,  y :  6 ))),  . line ( Line ( from :  ( x :  3 ,  y :  6 ),  to :  ( x :  0 ,  y :  0 ))), ] XCTAssertEqual ( polygon . paths ,  paths )\n With the value-oriented approach, we can take our  Set&lt;Path&gt; and transform it directly. Say you wanted to flip the result horizontally. You calculate the size and then return a new  Set&lt;Path&gt; with flipped coordinates.\n In the protocol-oriented approach, it would be somewhat difficult to transform our drawing steps. To flip horizontally, you need to know the final width. Since that width isn\u2019t known ahead of time, you\u2019d need to write a  Renderer that (1) saved all the calls to  move,  line, and  arc and then (2) pass it another  Render to render the flipped result.\n (This theoretical renderer is creating the same boundary we created with the value-oriented approach. Step 1 corresponds to our  .paths method; step 2 corresponds to  draw(Set&lt;Paths&gt;).)\n Say you have a complex  Diagram that isn\u2019t drawing correctly. You drop into the debugger and find where the  Diagram is drawn. How do you find the problem?\n If you\u2019re using the protocol-oriented approach, you\u2019ll need to create a  TestRenderer (if it\u2019s available outside your tests) or you\u2019ll need to use a real renderer and actually render somewhere. Inspecting that data will be difficult.\n But if you\u2019re using the value-oriented approach, you only need to call  paths to inspect this information. Debuggers can display values much more easily than effects.\n The boundary adds another semantic layer, which opens up additional possibilities for testing, transformation, and inspection.\n I\u2019ve used this approach on a number of projects and found it immensely helpful. Even with a simple example like the one given here, values have a number of benefits. But those benefits become much more obvious and helpful when working in larger, more complex systems.\n If you\u2019d like to see a real world example, check out  PersistDB, the Swift persistence library I\u2019ve been working on. The public API presents  Querys,  Predicates, and  Expressions. These are reduced to  SQL.Querys,  SQL.Predicates, and  SQL.Expressions. And each of those is reduced to a  SQL, a value representing some actual SQL.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 04:19:48", "tags": "\u7f16\u7a0b,\u4ef7\u503c,oriented,\u7ed8\u5236,renderer", "title": "\u9762\u5411\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b", "title_en": "Value-Oriented Programming", "transed": 1, "url": "https://matt.diephouse.com/2018/08/value-oriented-programming/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u7f16\u7a0b", "\u4ef7\u503c", "oriented", "\u7ed8\u5236", "renderer"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "41c3e622df199dd3e9622d5c1ea0718f.png", "infoid": 1000409, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u96be\u4ee5\u7f6e\u4fe1\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u3002\u5f15\u4eba\u5165\u80dc\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u7cbe\u660e\u7684\u8d2d\u7269\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6bcf\u5468\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\u3002", "note_en": "Unbelievable deals.

help and the money you&#39;ll make! \u00a0All you have to do first is... write a lot of code.\n How much code? \u00a0Well, obviously that depends on your idea and what business you&#39;re planning on setting up. \u00a0But there&#39;s a huge amount of code you&#39;ll need and want for  any SaaS business, and a lot of it you&#39;ll have to write before you can write even  line one of your business logic.\n    Okay, first you&#39;re gonna need something to start from. \u00a0Unless you plan on writing  everything from scratch, you&#39;ll need to set up some common frameworks to enable a modern web app to run. \u00a0On the front-end, that&#39;s something like:\n An HTTP requests library, if your framework doesn&#39;t come with one. \u00a0Examples:  Superagent,  Axios,  got.\n Getting all these various tools set up to work together will take some time as well. \u00a0Just searching &#34;configuring webpack for X&#34; reveals a minefield of blog posts written for various versions of webpack and X. \u00a0Some will help, some won&#39;t, and sometimes only experimentation will reveal which is which.\n Thankfully, there are tools that make a lot of this easier. \u00a0 Next.js for React and  Nuxt.js for Vue are just two examples, but there are many flavours of UI frameworks that can significantly reduce the setup time for the above. \u00a0Of course, now you have to learn how your UI framework works as well as your UI library, but generally that trade-off is worthwhile.\n Moving on to the back-end, you&#39;re going to want a web framework. \u00a0This will largely depend on the language you&#39;re working with, but you have plenty to choose from:\n  This list is by no means extensive - just tracking down all the available frameworks for a single language would be an article in it&#39;s own. \u00a0But it does display the variety of choices available. \u00a0Each language and framework has its own capabilities and trade-offs, and that&#39;s something you&#39;ll have to take into account before you make your choice. \u00a0(Or after! \u00a0It&#39;s just harder to change your mind at that point.)\n  Actually, let&#39;s take a step back for a second. \u00a0Sure, those are the basics, but you still need someplace to  run all that code, and in a way that speeds up your evaluation of code changes.\n You could run everything on your local machine, but that&#39;s rarely ideal. \u00a0For starters, your local environment is highly unlikely to resemble your production environment, and you don&#39;t want seemingly-minor differences causing problems when you deploy. \u00a0Plus, it&#39;s very hard (comparatively) to automate local environment setup, so adding anyone else to the project is bound to cause conflict, especially if they want to use an entirely different OS from you.\n   Virtual Machines have the advantage of being very simple to understand and work with. \u00a0If you know how to navigate your own system, you&#39;ll know how to navigate a virtual one just fine. \u00a0They&#39;re easily automated with something like  Ansible, and easy to use for development with something like  Vagrant. \u00a0Plus, you&#39;ll likely only need to modify a bit of your Ansible scripts or variables to turn your development deploy script into a production deploy script.\n But they can be a bit  heavy, as they are emulating an entire other machine. \u00a0There are good solutions to this (enabling CPU optimizations, using AMIs or other machine images to reduce deploy time, etc), but there&#39;s also an alternative.\n  Docker containers are  crazy lightweight. \u00a0Essentially, they just run the bits of the system required to run your code, as dictated by you. \u00a0Plus, a great many CI systems accept dockerfiles as input to automatically run tests and deploys of your code. \u00a0A well-built docker setup is a thing of beauty.\n However, docker can be a bit  confusing. \u00a0It requires learning a different mindset and tooling from working directly on a machine or virtual machine, and can lead you naturally towards more-complex solutions where a simpler one would otherwise work better for your use case. \u00a0(Hello, microservices!)\n  A small thing that can save you a lot of time is setting watchers on your code. \u00a0These are programs that keep an eye out for changes in your code, then re-compile and restart servers so that the latest version of your code is always running when you refresh your browser. \u00a0Many of the tools you&#39;ll use will come with built-in watchers (webpack, for example), but for others, you&#39;ll need to install your own ( nodemon to watch your Node.js server).\n And like with anything else, there&#39;s configuration you have to do to make sure that each watcher is only watching the correct directories, that files are shared between your host system and VM/docker container in a fast method that won&#39;t trip up your watchers, etc.\n  With any luck, you&#39;ll have a design already to work with, but you still need to translate that design into an application template and common UI components and architecture. A good CSS framework can really help here, allowing you to set up common colours and sizes that you can use across the entire project, and using component-based development can allow you to, say, create a TextInput element once, then use it across your project multiple times. You&#39;ll also need to set  ...\n  Proper logging can give you more and more-useful information than a slapdash setup can. \u00a0You&#39;ll want to log requests and request data, useful checkpoint information, and the usual stuff - errors, stack traces, etc. \u00a0But you also want to make sure not to log  too much. \u00a0For example, you&#39;ll obviously want to omit passwords, but you should also in general omit headers, especially headers containing authentication tokens, for obvious security reasons.\n  Database schemas are part of your app as well, and that means they need to be represented as code somewhere and checked into version control. \u00a0Manually updating your production database to match your development database is amateur-hour.\n So in addition to your back-end frameworks and your front-end frameworks, you&#39;ll need a database migration framework, and you&#39;ll need to write migrations for it.\n  Users are the fundamental primitive of a SaaS application, and there&#39;s a common set of interactions you&#39;ll require: sign-up, login, logout, edit profile, etc. \u00a0But sitting underneath all that is a bit of a contentious topic: user authentication.\n There are a bunch of ways to do user authentication, but most of them are wrong and will end up leaving you with security vulnerabilities. \u00a0 JWTs are popular and can be secured, but you need to follow some best practices:\n Don&#39;t store JWTs in localStorage, since any JS that runs on your page can access them, and if you get hit with a cross-site scripting attack, they can export your tokens en masse.\n  Include a global version code in your JWTs so that you can instantly invalidate all JWTs every issued.\n Include a user version code in your JWTs so that a user can instantly invalidate all JWTs ever issued for them specifically. \u00a0This is useful to include a &#34;log out all devices&#34; option for users who may have lost a device or had their account compromised.\n Send a  Cross-Site Request Forgery token with every request as a javascript-injected header, and make sure that token matches one you&#39;ve stored for the user on login.\n You&#39;ll notice a lot of these practices are &#34;in case of a security breach&#34;, and you&#39;d hope that if you did everything correctly, they&#39;d be unnecessary. \u00a0However, that&#39;s a fantasy and should be treated as such. \u00a0No site is 100% secure and bug-free, and yours won&#39;t be either. \u00a0Instead, you need to work in layers, so that if any one layer of security fails, there are still other layers and countermeasures in place.\n  When users sign up, log in, and really all throughout your app, they&#39;ll be filling out and submitting forms. These forms will need to be validated for the appropriate data, preferably on both the front-end (before the data is sent to the server, to provide the best experience to the user) and the back-end (to ensure no junk data is saved to the database). If your back-end isn&#39;t in JavaScript, you&#39;ll need validation libraries for both languages that have the  ...\n  Transactional email is the email you send when certain events happen for your users. \u00a0These can be lifecycle events, like welcome emails, &#34;trial about to expire&#34; emails, etc, or service-related emails like email address confirmation emails, password reset emails, notifications about your service, etc.\n You&#39;ll need to find and configure a decent mailer module, and usually perform some DNS configuration at your mail service host&#39;s instruction. \u00a0Some mailer modules will come with template capabilities built-in, while others will leave you to install your own.\n  Getting paid is why most people are going to start a SaaS in the first place, so processing payments and subscriptions is mightily important. Choosing and setting up an account with a payments provider is up to individual preference, but Stripe offers probably the best API and developer experience out there, while PayPal is usually the most-requested provider of choice from users. It&#39;s likely that you&#39;ll want to offer multiple ways to pay through multiple providers,  ...\n If you offer subscriptions, you&#39;ll want to allow users to choose between a monthly billing cycle and an annual one. \u00a0Annual billing is a great way for dedicated users to save money, while also offering you the benefits of higher  LTV and getting you the money up-front, increasing your liquidity.\n If you have multiple levels of plans, you&#39;ll need to implement the ability for users to change between those levels, usually offering a prorated fee for the month of transition.\n Though it&#39;s definitely not the &#34;happy path&#34;, you&#39;ll need to offer users the ability to cancel subscriptions. \u00a0You shouldn&#39;t add extra friction to this, since some users will just be cancelling temporarily, and you want to leave a good impression on them, but it&#39;s important to try to capture the reason they&#39;re leaving, so you can improve your service.\n  Once you&#39;ve fully-developed your fancy new SaaS, you&#39;re going to need to put it up on the web for people to interact with, and for that, you&#39;re going to need a deploy system. \u00a0Even if that system is largely manual, you&#39;re going to want defined, repeatable, documented steps that ensure that deploys go off without incident.\n   There are a whole lot more things you can do to ensure a safe and clean deploy, but this list is at least a good starting place.\n  Much like how we discussed security in layers above, backups of production data are another layer of defence in case something goes wrong. \u00a0If you&#39;re still using manual processes to alter user data, it can be very easy for a slip of the keys to accidentally alter or delete the wrong user&#39;s data. \u00a0And if you&#39;re using automated processes, it&#39;s usually a lot harder to make those simple mistakes, but more complex mistakes can make it very easy to edit or delete  huge  ...\n What makes a proper backup, then? \u00a0That&#39;s a whole topic on its own, but you should start with:\n Complete: Don&#39;t just backup the database - if the user uploads files, those should be backed up as well.\n  Retained: You&#39;ll want to keep your backups around for a while, though you might want to set up a schedule for longer-retained backups. \u00a0(i.e. Daily backups retained for 30 days, weekly backups retained for 3 months, monthly backups retained for 1 year.)\n Secure: Your backups should be kept with the same level of security as your data. \u00a0If your data is encrypted at rest, your backups should be as well. \u00a0Make sure to keep your encryption keys secure. \u00a0If you lose those keys, you lose the backup.\n Tested: A backup that hasn&#39;t been tested  is not a backup. \u00a0You don&#39;t want to find out that your backup process doesn&#39;t work (or stopped working) when you need to restore critical data. \u00a0There should be an automated test process that runs after backups are created.\n If you&#39;re lucky, your hosting platform will offer some level of database backup as a service, which will save you a lot of time and effort setting up. \u00a0It likely won&#39;t cover 100% of your needs, but it will get you a lot closer than starting from scratch.\n  Okay! \u00a0That&#39;ll get you off the ground, but once you start seeing any success at all, you&#39;re going to start wanting something a little more... robust. \u00a0Eventually, manually editing the database is going to get tedious (not to mention dangerous), and users will start asking the same questions over and over. \u00a0You&#39;re going to have to slow down on development related to your core business and implement a bunch more supporting features.\n  You can edit and delete users directly from the database, sure, but all it takes is one time forgetting to add a  WHERE or  LIMIT clause to a statement to make you long for a proper administration console. \u00a0(And backups. \u00a0You set up backups, right?)\n An admin console is also a great place for dashboards, user statistics, summaries, metrics, etc. \u00a0Your admin console can become your one-stop-shop for running your SaaS.\n  Documentation can serve multiple purposes. \u00a0Primarily, it&#39;s for user education, but conveniently, this is user education you don&#39;t have to do manually. \u00a0Think about it like automated customer support - a user that answer their question from your documentation is a user that doesn&#39;t email you.\n If your documentation is publicly available, it can also help users make purchasing decisions. \u00a0By answering questions about your service openly and up-front, you can let users more-easily determine if your service will work for them, as well as reassure them about your transparency.\n Public documentation also helps with SEO, since your keywords will likely naturally come up frequently on your documentation pages.\n  Once you have a sufficient number or sufficiently large customers, you&#39;ll likely start getting requests around tax time for their billing history. \u00a0Your payment system will keep track of payments for you, and many of them will be able to generate invoices from their web interface that you can send to customers who request it.\n That might hold you for a while, but eventually, you&#39;ll want this functionality built into your system, so clients can self-serve, and your customer support team can focus on more-important issues.\n  Making the right decisions early on and as your service grows can have compounding benefits, but frequently, it&#39;s difficult to find time to devote to tasks that aren&#39;t seen as critical. \u00a0Still, if you can make the time to invest in them, it can pay off for you and your users as well.\n  Especially now, when people are trying to cut costs in both their lives and businesses, the ability to  pause a subscription instead of  cancel it outright can mean the difference between saving a customer and losing them. \u00a0Similarly, the ability to credit customers some free time or usage on your service can aid in retention, especially if something goes wrong and you want to make it up to them.\n  When displaying publicly-visible auto-incrementing IDs (such as user IDs), it can be a good idea to obfuscate what that number actually is. \u00a0This prevents competitors and skittish customers from identifying how much usage your service has seen so far. \u00a0A great library for this is  Hashids, which has many compatible implementations across many languages.\n  The fewer languages your app uses, the less common code that you&#39;ll have to duplicate between the various services and projects you require. Some are going to be unavoidable, such as JavaScript if you have a web app with any serious browser interactions, Swift for iOS, and Java/Kotlin for Android. Web apps, however, offer a truly terrifying number of languages you can choose for server code: PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, Typescript, Go, Rust, Java,  ...\n In extreme situations, you can limit yourself to just one language, even across multiple disparate platforms. \u00a0JavaScript can do front-end and back-end web development, desktop development through Electron, and mobile development through Cordova. \u00a0There are definite trade-offs for going this route, but for a smaller studio, this opens up a multi-platform strategy on a limited budget.\n  Linters like  ESLint,  RuboCop, and  Flake8 can make a  marked improvement in your code. \u00a0They can catch stylistic errors long before they make it into production, and many stylistic errors are really just shortcomings of your chosen language, where hard-to-find bugs breed and propagate.\n  Monorepos are  great! \u00a0They&#39;re especially great if you&#39;re just starting your SaaS, as they&#39;re far simpler than trying to work with multiple repositories when managing dependencies, figuring out code re-use, and ensuring that all the correct code is committed before deploys go out.\n Everyone&#39;s situation is different, of course, and it may make sense in your case to go with multiple repositories, or even one day switch to such a strategy, but when you&#39;re starting out, you want to limit the complexity of your project as much as you can, and the monorepo strategy will definitely pay off in this regard.\n  Being able to log in as your users from your Admin Console can help immensely when trying to sort out customer service issues. Instead of having several back-and-forth &#34;what do you see now?&#34; emails, you can just log in as them and find out. There are a lot of things to consider when writing a user impersonation feature, however: Do you require special access to impersonate users? Do you require the user&#39;s permission to impersonate  ...\n These aren&#39;t the only considerations, but ideally it&#39;s enough to make the point that there&#39;s a lot more to user impersonation than simply changing a token ID.\n  Once you start getting enough customers with sufficient expectations, you&#39;ll have to make modifications to your deploy process for increased reliability and flexibility:\n Updating in-place won&#39;t work forever. \u00a0Eventually, switching to  blue/green deploys or even something as simple as displaying a maintenance mode page while you update will be necessary to keep people from interacting with the system while performing significant changes.\n If you have a complex  SPA, you&#39;ll want to be able to inform users when you&#39;ve made an update that requires reloading that code. \u00a0Tracking version numbers both in your UI code and on the server will allow you to pop up a notification, allowing the user to save their work and then reload.\n Ideally, you should be using a  bug  tracking  service. \u00a0If you also send your  source maps to them when performing a deploy, they can provide even better error messages when UI errors occur.\n Serving your UI JavaScript from your server is simple and easy, but users appreciate  fast, and your job is to do the hard work so that users have a good time. \u00a0A relatively easy way to speed up your user&#39;s experience is to upload your UI JavaScript on release to a  CDN. \u00a0This is a one-time change you need to make that pays dividends for your users going forwards.\n You&#39;ll likely be manually checking that releases go as expected, but automated smoke tests that run on every deploy are a better way to catch issues that might otherwise slip by you when you&#39;re tired, distracted, or in a hurry.\n  If you don&#39;t want to start from an empty folder and write all this code yourself, you should consider using a SaaS starter kit, and it just so happens that you&#39;re reading the blog for one right now! \u00a0With Nodewood, you can get started writing business logic today, saving weeks or even months of development time.\n Nodewood starts you off with a full working web app, with a Vue front-end and Express back-end, built entirely from JavaScript. \u00a0Form validation, testing, user authentication and management, subscription/billing are all built-in, alongside a sleek and customizable application theme with an easy-to-extend admin console.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 04:19:37", "tags": "\u4ee3\u7801,saas,code,users", "title": "\u542f\u52a8SaaS\u9700\u8981\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5217\u8868", "title_en": "The List of Code You Need to Write to Start a SaaS", "transed": 1, "url": "https://nodewood.com/blog/the-huge-list-of-code-you-need-to-write-to-start-a-saas/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u4ee3\u7801", "saas", "code", "users"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000406, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u8fd9\u7bc7\u4e3a\u201c\u5723\u5730\u4e9a\u54e5\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bc4\u8bba\u201d\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u64b0\u5199\u7684\u77ed\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e39\u5c3c\u5c14\u00b7\u7d22\u6d1b\u592b(Daniel Solove)\u6559\u6388\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u201c\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u9690\u7792\u201d\u7684\u8bba\u70b9\u3002\u5f53\u88ab\u95ee\u53ca\u653f\u5e9c\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u65f6\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u662f\uff1a\u6211\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u9690\u7792\u7684\u3002\u6839\u636e\u201c\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u9690\u85cf\u201d\u7684\u8bba\u70b9\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u653f\u5e9c\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u6cd5\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u9690\u79c1\u4e0d\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u6ca1\u6709\u6b63\u5f53\u7406\u7531\u58f0\u79f0\u5b83\u662f\u79c1\u4eba\u7684\u3002\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u597d\u8bf4\u7684..\u3002\n\u7d22\u6d1b\u592b\uff0c\u4e39\u5c3c\u5c14\u00b7J\uff0c\u6211\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u9690\u7792\u7684\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u3002\u201c\u5723\u5730\u4e9a\u54e5\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bc4\u8bba\u201d\uff0c\u7b2c44\u5377\uff0c\u7b2c745\u9875\uff0c2007\u5e74\uff1b\u534e\u76db\u987f\u5927\u5b66\u6cd5\u5b66\u9662\u516c\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u7b2c289\u53f7\u3002\u53ef\u5728srn\uff1ahttps://ssrn.com/abstract=998565\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u3002", "note_en": "In this short essay, written for a symposium in the San Diego Law Review, Professor Daniel Solove examines the nothing to hide argument.

API c", "note_en": "On a recent  AWS Cost Optimisation Q&amp;A, Corey Quinn talked about his experiments with  DynamoDB:\n  I\u2019ve been diving deeper into Dynamo than I would expect. It\u2019s surprisingly awesome. I don\u2019t know much about databases, but I\u2019m looking at it, and now I\u2019m wondering:  \u201cDynamo\u2019s awesome, what can I misuse it as?\u201d S3 is my favourite message queue, Route\u00a053 is my favourite database, but I\u2019m not entirely sure what\u2019s going on as far. As far as other creative uses, the things I could misuse. Maybe using Dynamo as a compute service \u2013 I bet I can teach that thing to place chess.\n  DynamoDB is Amazon\u2019s hosted NoSQL service \u2013 basically, a database. It\u2019s a key-value store for holding large amounts of unstructured data. We use DynamoDB for data storage at work, so I know a bit about using it, and I love taking  terrible brilliant ideas and dialling them up to 11.\n  When you\u2019re learning to program, a common task is building a calculator: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  This would be a good way to test Amazon\u2019s least-loved compute platform \u2013 can we build a calculator on top of DynamoDB? It turns out we can, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to walk through in this post. (Extending this experiment to play chess is left as an exercise for the reader.)\n  For the avoidance of doubt: this is a Bad Idea\u2122. Do not use this code in production, or within a ten-mile radius of a production environment. This is a satire post, not serious programming.\n       DynamoDB supports a wide variety of programming languages, including  Java,  .NET and  Python. I\u2019m going to use Python in this post, because that\u2019s what I\u2019m familiar with, but these ideas can be used in other languages.\n  Within DynamoDB, we run all our computing inside  Table. Within a table, operations run within  Rows. Let\u2019s write some code to create a table for us, and to assign a row ID that we can use to track an individual calculation:\n  import  contextlib import  uuid import  boto3 dynamodb  =  boto3 . resource ( &#34;dynamodb&#34; ) class  DynamoCalculator :  &#34;&#34;&#34; An integer calculator that uses DynamoDB for compute. &#34;&#34;&#34;  def  __enter__ ( self ):  table_name  =  f &#34;calculator-{uuid.uuid4()}&#34;  dynamodb . create_table (  AttributeDefinitions = [{  &#34;AttributeName&#34; :  &#34;calculation_id&#34; ,  &#34;AttributeType&#34; :  &#34;S&#34; ,  }],  TableName = table_name ,  KeySchema = [{  &#34;AttributeName&#34; :  &#34;calculation_id&#34;  ...\n  The context manager handles creation  and cleanup for us \u2013 not only does it create a table for us, it deletes it afterwards. This does create a bit of latency before you can do your first calculation, but it means we don\u2019t have tables hanging around in our account.\n  Remember: the expensive part of the cloud isn\u2019t what you use, it\u2019s what you forget to turn off. This API ensures that we\u2019ll never forget to turn off our table!\n  Serious point:  if you create resources that have cleanup that should always run, context managers are a great way to enforce this in a Python API. Examples are sockets or files, which you should always close when you\u2019re done.\n  In other languages, you use  try \u2026 except \u2026 finally, but the caller has to remember to do the cleanup. Python has the  with statement to hide this complexity from the caller. You\u2019ve probably used one already \u2013  with open(\u2026), which always closes the file once you\u2019re done using it, whether your code returned or threw an exception.\n  If you\u2019re not using them, they\u2019re a powerful feature and worth learning.\n    DynamoDB supports numbers as a first-class type, and we can read and write numeric values with the GetItem and PutItem APIs, respectively. The PutItem API completely replaces the contents of a row, which is useful in some cases and easy to batch, but it\u2019s not always the right tool for the job.\n  Suppose we were using DynamoDB to store a counter. We want to increment the value of the counter, but without reading the existing value from the table \u2013 if another process updated the counter between the read and the write, we\u2019d lose data. For this, we can use the UpdateItem API, which can modify a row based on its existing values.\n    class  DynamoCalculator :  ...  def  add ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  int :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Adds two integers and returns the result. &#34;&#34;&#34;  with  self . row_id ()  as  calculation_id :  self . table . put_item (  Item = { &#34;calculation_id&#34; :  calculation_id ,  &#34;sum&#34; :  x }  )  self . table . update_item (  Key = { &#34;calculation_id&#34; :  calculation_id },  UpdateExpression = &#34;SET #sum = #sum + :y&#34; ,  ExpressionAttributeNames = { &#34;#sum&#34; :  &#34;sum&#34; },  ExpressionAttributeValues  ...\n  Here we use PutItem to write the first number ( x) to the table. Then we do an UpdateItem to add the second number ( y) to the existing value. Finally, we call GetItem to retrieve the sum.\n  It turns out we can consolidate these three API calls into one. The UpdateItem API creates a row if it doesn\u2019t exist yet (saving the PutItem), and we can also ask it to give us the value it just wrote to the row (saving the GetItem). Here\u2019s what the consolidated version looks like:\n  class  DynamoCalculator :  ...  def  add ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  int :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Adds two integers and returns the result. &#34;&#34;&#34;  with  self . row_id ()  as  calculation_id :  resp  =  self . table . update_item (  Key = { &#34;calculation_id&#34; :  calculation_id },  UpdateExpression = &#34;SET #sum = :x + :y&#34; ,  ExpressionAttributeNames = { &#34;#sum&#34; :  &#34;sum&#34; },  ExpressionAttributeValues = { &#34;:x&#34; :  x ,  &#34;:y&#34; :  y },  ReturnValues = &#34;ALL_NEW&#34;  )  return  ...\n    with  DynamoCalculator ()  as  calculator :  print ( calculator . add ( 1 ,  2 ))  # 3  print ( calculator . add ( 5 ,  3 ))  # 8  print ( calculator . add ( 5 ,  - 1 ))  # 4\n  Addition is a very common operation, so it\u2019s important we make it as fast as possible. Consolidating three API calls into one is a good optimisation!\n    Subtraction is the opposite of addition, with the convenient property that subtracting  y is the same as adding (negative  y). This leads some people to define subtraction like so:\n  def  subtract ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  int :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Subtracts one integer from another and returns the result. &#34;&#34;&#34;  return  self . add ( x ,  - y )\n  But you and I know these people are feeble and weak-willed. This approach uses Python to reverse the sign of  y for us, which is a computational operation. What\u2019s the point of having a compute platform like DynamoDB if we don\u2019t use it for computing?\n  DynamoDB\u2019s UpdateItem API supports subtraction as well as addition, which is a much better approach:\n  class  DynamoCalculator :  ...  def  subtract ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  int :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Subtracts one integer from another and returns the result. &#34;&#34;&#34;  with  self . row_id ()  as  calculation_id :  resp  =  self . table . update_item (  Key = { &#34;calculation_id&#34; :  calculation_id },  UpdateExpression = &#34;SET #difference = :x - :y&#34; ,  ExpressionAttributeNames = { &#34;#difference&#34; :  &#34;difference&#34; },  ExpressionAttributeValues = { &#34;:x&#34;\n      This is where things get a bit trickier \u2013 the UpdateExpression used by the UpdateItem API doesn\u2019t support multiplication, only addition and subtraction. We\u2019ll have to build our own implementation of multiplication. A simple approach is to use a recursive algorithm:\n  def multiply(x, y): if y == 0: return 0 else: return x + multiply(x, y - 1)\n    multiply(5, 3) = 5 + multiply(5, 2) = 5 + (5 + multiply(5, 1)) = 5 + (5 + (5 + multiply(5, 0))) = 5 + (5 + (5 + 0)) = 15\n    If we want to implement this, we need a test for equality, and branching statements. How do we do that? We could use Python, or we could find a way to do them with DynamoDB. We both know what the correct answer is.\n  Let\u2019s start by testing if two integers are the same. For this, we can misuse  conditional operations.\n  Suppose we were using DynamoDB to store date-based information. Each row includes a timestamp, and we want newer data to replace older data, but not the other way around. We could do a GetItem and then a PutItem before we write anything, but if the row changes between the Get and the Put, we could write bad data.\n  A better approach would be to supply a condition with our PutItem \u2013 for example,  \u201conly update this row if the timestamp in the new row is greater than the timestamp in the already-stored row\u201d. If the condition is true, the write succeeds. If the condition is false, the write fails and we get an error.\n  One of the conditions you can specify is that two values are the same. So let\u2019s try to write to the table with this condition \u2013 if it succeeds, the numbers are equal; if it fails, they\u2019re not.\n  class  DynamoCalculator :  ...  def  eq ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  bool :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Returns True if two integers are equal, False otherwise. &#34;&#34;&#34;  with  self . row_id ()  as  calculation_id :  try :  self . table . put_item (  Item = { &#34;calculation_id&#34; :  calculation_id },  ConditionExpression = &#34;:x = :y&#34; ,  ExpressionAttributeValues = { &#34;:x&#34; :  x ,  &#34;:y&#34; :  y },  )  except  Exception  as  exc :  return  False  else :  return  ...\n  (We are using a bit of Python control flow for the  try \u2026 except block \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a better way to do this, but at least the equality testing is done inside DynamoDB.)\n  Next, let\u2019s use DynamoDB to implement basic control flow. For an IF statement, we have a condition, an \u201cif true\u201d action, and an \u201cif false\u201d action. We can continue to misuse conditional operations, and pass the boolean directly to DynamoDB:\n  from  typing  import  Callable class  DynamoCalculator :  ...  def  if_ (  self ,  condition :  bool ,  if_true :  Callable [[],  int ],  if_false :  Callable [[],  int ]  )  -&gt;  bool :  &#34;&#34;&#34; If ``condition`` is True, returns the output of ``if_true``. If ``condition`` is False, returns the output of ``if_false``. &#34;&#34;&#34;  with  self . row_id ()  as  calculation_id :  try :  self . table . put_item (  Item = { &#34;calculation_id&#34; :  calculation_id  ...\n  Notice that this code doesn\u2019t call \u201cif_true\u201d or \u201cif_false\u201d until they\u2019re needed. This is a sophisticated programming technique called   lazy evaluation, and our ability to use it here speaks to the power of DynamoDB as a computing platform.\n    class  DynamoCalculator :  ...  def  multiply ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  int :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Multiplies two integers and returns the result. &#34;&#34;&#34;  def  if_y_non_zero ():  return  self . add ( x ,  self . multiply ( x ,  self . subtract ( y ,  1 )))  return  self . if_ (  self . eq ( y ,  0 ),  if_true = lambda :  0 ,  if_false = if_y_non_zero  )\n  This works if  y is positive or zero, but if  y is negative it keeps decrementing forever. We need to tweak our algorithm slightly:\n  def multiply(x, y): if y == 0: return 0 elif y &lt; 0: return -1 * multiply(x, -y) else: return x + multiply(x, y - 1)\n  We can get  -y by computing  0 - y, and similar for  -1 * multiply(x, -y). This leaves the problem of working out if  y is negative.\n  DynamoDB supports all the logical operators in conditional updates, so we can follow the same technique we\u2019ve already used twice:\n  class  DynamoCalculator :  ...  def  lt ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  int :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Returns True if x &lt; y, False otherwise. &#34;&#34;&#34;  with  self . row_id ()  as  calculation_id :  try :  self . table . put_item (  Item = { &#34;calculation_id&#34; :  calculation_id },  ConditionExpression = &#34;:x &lt; :y&#34; ,  ExpressionAttributeValues = { &#34;:x&#34; :  x ,  &#34;:y&#34; :  y },  )  except  Exception  as  exc :  return  False  else  ...\n  This gives us the last piece we need to create a fully working multiplication function:\n  class  DynamoCalculator :  ...  def  multiply ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  int :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Multiplies two integers and returns the result. &#34;&#34;&#34;  def  if_y_non_negative ():  return  self . add ( x ,  self . multiply ( x ,  self . subtract ( y ,  1 )))  def  if_y_negative ():  y_pos  =  self . subtract ( 0 ,  y )  return  self . subtract ( 0 ,  self . multiply ( x ,  y_pos ))  return  self . if_ (  self . eq ( y ,  0 ),  if_true = lambda :  0 ,  if_false = lambda  ...\n      def divide(x, y): if y &lt; 0: return -1 * divide(x, -y) else: if x &lt; y: return 0 else: return 1 + divide(x - y, y)\n    class  DynamoCalculator :  ...  def  divide ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  int :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Divides x by y and returns the result. Assumes y != 0. &#34;&#34;&#34;  def  if_y_negative ():  return  self . subtract ( 0 ,  self . divide ( x ,  self . subtract ( 0 ,  y )))  def  if_y_positive ():  return  self . if_ (  self . lt ( x ,  y ),  if_true = lambda :  0 ,  if_false = lambda :  self . add ( 1 ,  self . divide ( self . subtract ( x ,  y ),  y ))  )  return  self  ...\n  This is the great thing about building our calculator from a library of reusable functions and operators: we can combine them to create more sophisticated functions.\n    We can continue to compose the functions we\u2019ve already written to round out our calculator.\n  We can get \u201cnot equal to\u201d by defining a NOT operator, and applying that to the output of \u201ceq()\u201d:\n  def  not_ ( self ,  condition :  bool )  -&gt;  bool :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Returns the negation of ``condition``. &#34;&#34;&#34;  return  self . if_ (  condition ,  if_true = lambda :  False ,  if_false = lambda :  True  )  def  ne ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  bool :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Returns True if two integers are different, False otherwise. &#34;&#34;&#34;  return  self . not_ ( self . eq ( x ,  y ))\n  We can define \u201cless than or equal to\u201d by defining an OR operator, and applying that to the output of \u201clt()\u201d and \u201ceq()\u201d:\n  def  or_ ( self ,  condition1 :  bool ,  condition2 :  bool )  -&gt;  bool :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Returns True if at least one of ``condition1`` and ``condition2`` is True. &#34;&#34;&#34;  int_1  =  self . if_ ( condition1 ,  if_true = lambda :  1 ,  if_false = lambda :  0 )  int_2  =  self . if_ ( condition2 ,  if_true = lambda :  1 ,  if_false = lambda :  0 )  return  self . ne ( self . add ( int_1 ,  int_2 ),  0 )  def  le ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  ...\n  We can define \u201cgreater than\u201d and \u201cgreater than or equal to\u201d as the negation of \u201cless than or equal to\u201d and \u201cless than\u201d, respectively:\n  def  gt ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  bool :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Returns True if x &gt; y, False otherwise. &#34;&#34;&#34;  return  self . not_ ( self . le ( x ,  y ))  def  ge ( self ,  x :  int ,  y :  int )  -&gt;  bool :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Returns True if x &gt;= y, False otherwise. &#34;&#34;&#34;  return  self . not_ ( self . lt ( x ,  y ))\n  And finally, for completion\u2019s sake, let\u2019s define an AND operator and a NAND operator:\n  def  and_ ( self ,  condition1 :  bool ,  condition2 :  bool )  -&gt;  bool :  &#34;&#34;&#34; Returns True if both ``condition1`` and ``condition2`` are True. &#34;&#34;&#34;  int_1  =  self . if_ ( condition1 ,  if_true = lambda :  1 ,  if_false = lambda :  0 )  int_2  =  self . if_ ( condition2 ,  if_true = lambda :  1 ,  if_false = lambda :  0 )  return  self . eq ( self . add ( int_1 ,  int_2 ),  2 )  def  nand ( self ,  condition1 :  bool  ...\n  The  NAND gate is a key part of processor design, and being able to do it only using DynamoDB proves its capabaility as a computing platform.\n    This post shows the potential for using DynamoDB as a cloud computing platform. We were able to implement a simple calculator, comparison operators, and even better, a set of  logical gates (AND, OR, NOT and NAND). This lays the foundation for building far more sophisticated programs.\n  Performance remains an issue. As we \u2019d expect, simple operations (addition, subtraction) are faster than more complex operations (multiplication, division), but there \u2019s room for improvement in both areas. It \u2019s not clear whether the bottleneck is DynamoDB itself, or my home internet connection. Hopefully a future update will bring the ability to run code directly  ...\n  Pricing follows the usual AWS model of \u201cclear as mud\u201d. DynamoDB pricing is based on  how many read and write \u201cunits\u201d you use, but it\u2019s not obvious how many units a given operation might require.\n  It\u2019s too soon to recommend using DynamoDB for production compute workloads, but these early signs are promising. I hope Amazon continues to work on improving DynamoDB, and I look forward to seeing how other people use it in future.\n        DynamoDB isn\u2019t a compute platform, it\u2019s a database. Still not a question. And you\u2019re wrong \u2013 it  is a compute platform, as this experiment shows.\n  Why did you do this? Finally, a proper question! Partly for fun, partly as a way to get some practice with the gnarly bits of the DynamoDB API that I forget every time I use.\n  Can I get all the code you\u2019ve written? Sure, it\u2019s all here:\n      #!/usr/bin/env python &#34;&#34;&#34;What happens if you try to use DynamoDB as an integer calculator?&#34;&#34;&#34; import  contextlib from  typing  import  Callable

A failure in one path does not affect the other,\rso the discrepancy in result indicates an error.\n  A bad redundancy is distinguished by either not providing a checkable\rresult, or by having the redundant paths dependent on each other in\rsuch a way that an error in one path propagates to the other, so the wrong\rresults agree.\n  Programming languages extensively use this to reduce coding errors. If there was no redundancy at all in a language, then any random sequence of characters would be a valid program. Every error message generated by the compiler is an example of redundancy in the language that finds user errors. An example of a language with next to no redundancy is machine code \u2014nearly any bit pattern is a valid opcode. Anyone who \u2019s written a disassembler for machine code knows that it \u2019s nearly impossible  ...\n    Variable declarations are one. But since the compiler can figure the need for declarations from the context, declarations seem like prime redundancies that can be jettisoned. This is called implicit variable declaration. It sounds like a great idea, and it gets regularly enshrined into new languages. The problem is, the compiler cannot tell the difference between an intended new declaration and a typo \u2014and the poor maintenance programmer can \u2019t tell, either. After a while, though, the  ...\n      why would semicolons be needed? The compiler is perfectly capable of figuring\rthat out. But what about:\n    that could be  (x = 3 + y * p++) where the  * is a multiply rather than an\rindirection. Lack of semicolons also makes error recovery poor, as the\rcompiler cannot figure out where the current wrong statement ends and the\rnext one starts. Semicolons make for nice \u201canchors\u201d in the text that help\rboth the compiler and the reader synchronize with the code structure.\n  (Javascript is an example where the semicolon is optional and is inferred\rfrom the grammar. Python is not an example, because it still uses lexical\rcues like  \\n to indicate the end of a statement.)\n  Probably the best example of redundancy in a programming language is\runit tests. Unit tests are an alternative specification for what a function\rdoes, but rather than specify the method, they specify the results.\rThe odds of the same error in the method being reproduced in the results\rare very, very low. This means that even only moderate use of\runit tests can dramatically improve program quality, which is why\runit test support is built in to the D programming language.\n    Redundancy isn\u2019t always good. In C, for example, source code is divided\rup into header files and implementation files. The declarations are reproduced\rin both. The problem with this redundancy is that the copies are literally\rcopied text \u2014 an error in one is simply copied to the other, giving no\rvalue to the redundancy. A useful redundancy needs to be independent.\n      At first glance, this looks like a good redundancy. It\u2019s checking that the\rtype of  tmp is  int. But no, it isn\u2019t checking the type, it\u2019s forcing\rthe type to be  int, and converting the initializer  (a+b) to be  int.\rThis can result in problems if  a and  b are redeclared as some other type,\rlike  unsigned or  float. To\rsolve this problem, the D programming language has introduced  auto to\rhave  tmp declared as the type of  (a+b):\n        A common case is the syntactic ambiguity between declarations and expressions\rin C++. For example:\n    Is that a declaration of  P as a pointer to  T, or is it multiplying  T and  P?\rA little redundancy would go a long way here.\n  There\u2019s the overloaded use of  &lt; and  &gt; to denote template argument lists in C++.\rWhat does:\n    mean? The consequence of this lack of redundancy is notoriously obtuse error\rmessages as the compiler has too little to guide it in guessing at what\rthe user\u2019s intent is.\n  C++ has added some keywords, like  typename, and some productions, like\r -&gt;template, to add redundancy and so improve\rerror checking and diagnostics.\n  You can get a feel for where redundancy in a language is lacking by looking\rat warning diagnostics the compiler implementors tend to add over time.\rFor the designer of a new language, common warnings are a rich source of\rinspiration for improvements.\n    Many programming language designers mistakenly assume that removing redundancy makes programmers more productive. This is exhibited with small benchmarks showing how terse they are, with the implication that terseness makes a language powerful and expressive. And this does work great for small programs, such as scripts that are only a few lines long. But it doesn \u2019t scale well, and this rapidly becomes apparent as the source code gets larger and  ...\n  Well\u2014designed redundancy can, however, dramatically improve productivity\rwith its ability to uncover errors early in the development process.\rRedundancy not only helps find errors, it helps produce better error\rmessages, and helps the maintenance programmer in understanding the intent\rof the code.\n  The trick, of course, is figuring out which redundancies are good,\rand which aren\u2019t.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 04:19:16", "tags": "\u7f16\u7a0b,programming language,\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00,programming,\u9519\u8bef", "title": "\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59", "title_en": "Redundancy in Programming Languages", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.digitalmars.com/articles/b05.html", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u7f16\u7a0b", "language", "\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00", "\u9519\u8bef"]}]
