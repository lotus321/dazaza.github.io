"note_en": "Omega-3, a fatty acid commonly found in fish oil, may have long-term neurodevelopmental effects that ultimately reduce antisocial and aggressive behavior problems in children, a new study suggests.\n At the forefront of a field known as &#34;neurocriminology,&#34; Adrian Raine of the University of Pennsylvania has long studied the interplay between biology and environment when it comes to antisocial and criminal behavior. With strong physiological evidence that disruption to the emotion-regulating parts of the brain can manifest in violent outbursts, impulsive decision-making and other behavioral traits associated with crime, much of Raine&#39;s research involves looking at biological  ...\n    A new study by Raine now suggests that omega-3, a fatty acid commonly found in fish oil, may have long-term neurodevelopmental effects that ultimately reduce antisocial and aggressive behavior problems in children.\n He is a Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor with appointments in the School of Arts &amp; Sciences and the Perelman School of Medicine.\n Along with Raine, the study featured Jill Portnoy a graduate student in the Department of Criminology, and Jianghong Liu, an associate professor in the Penn School of Nursing. They collaborated with Tashneem Mahoomed of Mauritius&#39; Joint Child Health Project and Joseph Hibbeln of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n  When Raine was a graduate student, he, his advisor and colleagues conducted a longitudinal study of children in the small island nation of Mauritius. The researchers tracked the development of children who had participated in an enrichment program as 3-year-olds and also the development of children who had not participated. This enrichment program had additional cognitive stimulation, physical exercise and nutritional enrichment. At 11 years, the participants showed a marked improvement  ...\n     Raine and his colleagues were interested in teasing apart the mechanisms behind this improvement. Other studies suggested the nutritional component was worth a closer look.\n &#34;We saw children who had poor nutritional status at age 3 were more antisocial and aggressive at 8, 11 and 17,&#34; Raine said. &#34;That made us look back at the intervention and see what stood out about the nutritional component. Part of the enrichment was that the children receiving an extra two and a half portions of fish a week.&#34;\n Other research at the time was beginning to show that omega-3 is critical to brain development and function.\n &#34;Omega-3 regulates neurotransmitters, enhances the life of a neuron and increases dendritic branching, but our bodies do not produce it. We can only get it from the environment,&#34; Raine said.\n Research on the neuroanatomy of violent criminals suggested this might be a place to intervene. Other brain-imaging researchers have shown that omega-3 supplementation increases the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region Raine found to have higher rates of damage or dysfunction in criminal offenders.\n     Raine&#39;s new study featured a randomized controlled trial where children would receive regular omega-3 supplements in the form of a juice drink. One hundred children, aged 8 to 16, would each receive a drink containing a gram of omega-3 once a day for six months, matched with 100 children who received the same drink without the supplement. The children and parents in both groups took a series of personality assessments and questionnaires at the start.\n After six months, the researchers administered a simple blood test to see if the children in the experimental group had higher levels of omega-3 than those in the controls. They also had both parents and children take the personality assessments. Six months after that, the researchers had parents and children take the assessment again to see if there were any lasting effects from the supplements.\n The assessments had parents rate their children on &#34;externalizing&#34; aggressive and antisocial behavior, such as getting into fights or lying, as well as &#34;internalizing&#34; behavior, such as depression, anxiety and withdrawal. Children were also asked to rate themselves on these traits.\n While the children&#39;s self-reports remained flat for both groups, the average rate of antisocial and aggressive behavior as described by the parents dropped in both groups by the six-month point. Critically, however, those rates returned to the baseline for the control group but remained lowered in the experimental group, at the 12-month point.\n &#34;Compared to the baseline at zero months,&#34; Raine said, &#34;both groups show improvement in both the externalizing and internalizing behavior problems after six months. That&#39;s the placebo effect.\n &#34;But what was particularly interesting was what was happening at 12 months. The control group returned to the baseline while the omega-3 group continued to go down. In the end, we saw a 42 percent reduction in scores on externalizing behavior and 62 percent reduction in internalizing behavior.&#34;\n At both the six- and 12-month check-ins, parents also answered questionnaires about their own behavioral traits. Surprisingly, parents also showed an improvement in their antisocial and aggressive behavior. This could be explained by the parents taking some of their child&#39;s supplement, or simply because of a positive response to their child&#39;s own behavioral improvement.\n The researchers caution that this is still preliminary work in uncovering the role nutrition plays in the link between brain development and antisocial behavior. The changes seen in the one-year period of the experiment may not last, and the results may not be generalizable outside the unique context of Mauritius.\n Beyond these caveats, however, there is reason to further examine omega-3&#39;s role as a potential early intervention for antisocial behavior.\n &#34;As a protective factor for reducing behavior problems in children,&#34; Liu said, &#34;nutrition is a promising option; it is relatively inexpensive and can be easy to manage.&#34;\n Follow-up studies will include longer-term surveillance of children&#39;s behavioral traits and will investigate why their self-reports did not match the parental reports.\n    Materials provided by   University of Pennsylvania.

weird happened on the oil market last week. For a few minutes on April 20, the price of a barrel went  negativefor the first time ever. The unprecedented collapse of prices is linked to the pandemic, which has caused people to stop doing oil-guzzling things like flying and driving. There \u2019s now so much extra petroleum on the market that the world is running out of places to put it. If you \u2019re an oil producer, it seems like the sensible thing to do in this situation would be to \u2026stop producing  ...\n On Friday, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia, the US, and others will begin scaling back their production by nearly 10 million barrels per day. They hope that this will help stabilize prices and take some pressure off of producers and refineries that are scrambling to find a place to store the excess. But the rollback isn \u2019t likely to be enough. Oil producers would have to reduce production by almost three times that amount to match the downturn in demand.  ...\n   The short answer is because temporarily closing or \u201cshutting in\u201d a well costs money\u2014and potentially  lotsof money. It \u2019s not just about the foregone revenue, which is less of a concern when prices are dipping into the negative. It \u2019s about what happens when the well is opened back up. \u201cShutting in a well is not especially difficult, \u201dsays Eric van Oort, a petroleum engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. It \u2019s mostly a matter of shutting off a master valve at the surface, much like turning  ...\n The US has been the largest producer of crude oil in the world for the past two years, and the vast majority is dredged up in Texas and on offshore derricks in the Gulf of Mexico. On land, most of America\u2019s crude is produced from shale reservoirs, which trap the oil in rocks with low permeability. To set it free, companies use a technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that opens cracks in rocks deep in the Earth by blasting them with water or gas.\n  Shut-ins are a normal part of oil production, but they are usually limited to a few wells at a time and mostly undertaken for repairs. Petroleum producers have known for decades that shale wells that have previously been shut in produce less oil when they \u2019re reopened, says John McLennan, an expert in geomechanics at the University of Utah Energy and Geoscience Institute. But the exact cause of the damage is often unclear. McLennan says that one of the most well-supported explanations is water  ...\n  A well typically taps into a mixture of oil and water. Both are pumped to the surface, but the water is treated as waste. When a well is shut in, the ratio of oil to water is recalibrated, since there\u2019s no longer a big pipe sucking on the fissures in the rock. Because the rock in shale wells isn\u2019t very permeable, water may accumulate in the fractures. When the well opens up again, it may end up producing more water than oil, because the accumulated H 2O impedes the movement of oil. Shale wells  ...\n Van Oort says the amount of time a well is closed doesn\u2019t really affect how much damage the shut-in inflicts on the reservoir. Once the well is closed, the damage is done. If producers have to repeatedly shut the well, the damage can compound over time and reduce productivity even more. \u201cIt is always best to leave the well alone once you go to production,\u201d says van Oort.\n  The situation is a bit better for the roughly 1,000 offshore oil derricks in the Gulf of Mexico. These are typically conventional wells where a pipe is drilled into the ground and oil is pumped up\u2014almost like  sucking a milkshakethrough a straw. Offshore oil producers are accustomed to temporarily turning wells off during hurricanes, and shut-ins don \u2019t have as big of a negative effect on their ability to produce oil. The reason for this, says McLennan, is because the offshore reservoirs are more  ...\n But even though offshore reservoirs might not sustain as much damage from shut-ins, McLennan says the wells are a bit more challenging to turn off. Some subsea pipelines may need to be protected if the oil contains waxy paraffins, which can solidify in pipelines at the bottom of the ocean, where temperatures are just a few degrees above freezing. So before an offshore well can be turned off, there \u2019s often a lot of preventative maintenance that needs to be done, like flushing the pipes and filling  ...\n Although the OPEC agreement to reduce production officially begins on Friday, many US producers started shutting their wells weeks ago in response to dismally low prices. These shut-ins have largely been led by the roughly 2,000 small independent and private oil companies in the US, most of which produce less than 20,000 barrels per day. \u201cThe brunt of the pain is being felt by small companies with fewer wells, \u201dsays Frederick Lawerence, vice president of economics and international affairs at  ...\n Smaller independent and private companies don \u2019t have many of the advantages afforded to large independents or global companies like BP or ConocoPhillips. Bigger companies have priority access to pipelines and storage, and also tend to have diversified revenue streams \u2014they don \u2019t just produce the oil, they also refine it, transport it and so on. Smaller companies, by contrast, are \u201ctotally dependent on the wellhead, \u201dLawerence says. Without significant storage capacity, they have no choice but  ...\n Large companies may be able to cushion the blow from the drop in demand, but even they are not immune to shut-ins. According to a  Wall Street Journal  report last week, offshore drillers have already started shutting in wells, and they will close more in the near future to meet the reduced production targets that the US and other countries agreed to in April.\n Lawrence says that widespread shut-ins of both conventional and fracked oil wells is unprecedented. He expects the wave of shut-ins will result in some consolidation among smaller producers or acquisitions by larger companies. Covid-19 won\u2019t kill American oil, he says, but \u201cwhat has transpired will ultimately change the nature of the industry that emerges.\u201d\n   \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Want the best tools to get healthy?

"note_en": "When the garden eels at a Tokyo aquarium remove their heads from the sand, they are usually confronted by pairs of human eyes staring back at them through the glass.\n But  like other animals around the world, the eels at Sumida Aquarium are finding their environment transformed by the effects of the  coronavirus outbreak.\n They also appear to be forgetting what humans look like. Concerned that the garden eels \u2013 so named because their grass-like appearance when, en masse, they poke their heads out of the seabed \u2013 could come to see visitors as a threat, the aquarium is asking people to get in touch in the form of a calming video calls.\n The aquarium, housed in Tokyo Skytree \u2013 Japan\u2019s tallest structure \u2013 has been closed since the start of March and its garden eels have become used to a largely human-free environment.\n But the aquarium said the \u201cunprecedented situation\u201d had had put the eels and other creatures ill at ease.\n  \u201cThey don\u2019t see humans, except keepers, and they have started forgetting about humans,\u201d it said on its Twitter account this week.\n \u201cGarden eels in particular disappear into the sand and hide every time the keepers pass by,\u201d it said, adding that their oversensitive nature was making it difficult to monitor their health.\n \u201cHere is an urgent request,\u201d the aquarium wrote. \u201cCould you show your face to our garden eels from your home?\u201d it said, naming the event a \u201cface-showing festival\u201d.\n While garden eels are sensitive and wary by nature, the 300 of them living in one of the aquarium\u2019s tanks had grown accustomed to human visitors and rarely hid when approached by visitors.\n To help the eels reconnect with their admirers, the aquarium is setting up five tablets facing their tank, with users asked to connect through iPhones or iPads via the FaceTime app.\n Once the video calls start, people are asked to show their faces, wave and talk to the eels. But, given the animals\u2019 natural bashfulness, they are requested not to raise their voices.\n The festival is scheduled for 3-5 May, at the height of the Golden Week holiday, when many people who would normally travel are staying home during the country\u2019s Covid-19 state of emergency.\n The aquarium\u2019s plea has attracted lots of online support, under the Japanese hashtag \u001d#PleaseRememberHumans.\n \u201c\u2018When you gaze at the garden eels, the garden eels gaze at you.\u2019 Understood. I\u2019m happy to take part,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.\n \u201cThey need training to learn humans are not a threat!\u201d another wrote. \u201cInteresting.\u201d\n Many called on the aquarium to offer access to the eels via another app to allow those using PCs and phones with Android operating systems to take part.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:06:23", "tags":

"note_en": "NUBIA is a SoTA evaluation metric for text generation. It stands for NeUral Based Interchangeability Assessor. In addition to returning an interchangeability score, NUBIA also returns scores for semantic relation, contradiction, irrelevancy, logical agreement, and grammaticality.\n     Nubia is composed of three modules. The first is neural feature extraction. The three main neural features that power the metric are semantic similarity, logical inference, and sentence legibility. These are extracted by exposing layers from powerful (pretrained) language models: RoBERTa STS for semantic similarity, RoBERTa MNLI for logical inference, and GPT-2 for sentence legibility.\n The second module is the aggregator. This module is trained to approximate a function mapping input neural features to a quality score that reflects how interchangeable the sentences are. The objective is to come as close as possible to human evaluation.\n The final module is calibration. This is necessary because the aggregator is not bound between 0 and 1, nor does a regressed score comparing a reference sentence with itself always ouput 1. So to calibrate, the output is normalized against the score of the reference sentence compared with itself, and bound between 0 and 1.\n  We have been able to achieve SoTA performance in assessing the quality of machine translation and image captioning. Results below are the Absolute Pearson correlations with segment-level human judgments on WMT17 to-English translations.\n  Results below are the Kendall\u2019s Tau correlations with human judgment on the Flickr 8K dataset.\n  Nubia is especially powerful against BLEU and ROUGE. The following are the score and label graphs of Nubia, ROUGE-L and BLEU for the entire WMT-2017 segment level set.\n    s1, s2 = &#34;He agreed to a proposal of mine.&#34;,&#34;He gave his agreement to my proposal.&#34;\n but the BLEU, ROUGE and BERTScore are low (0.43, 0.28, 0.63) whereas the Nubia score is 0.95\n Rouge_1 is: 0.4285714235714286Rouge_2 is: 0.0BlEU is: 0.2802636449867835BERTScore is: (0.5967282652854919, 0.6308560967445374, 0.6143679618835449)Nubia Score: 0.9504227034094436Semantic relation: 4.672990322113037/5.0Percent chance of contradiction: 0.26220036670565605%Percent chance of irrelevancy or new information: 0.5306123290210962%Percent chance of logical agreement: 99.20719265937805%\n   When  &#34;Impossible!&#34; was changed to  &#34;Totally feasible!&#34;, the contradiction score went from  0.073% to  99.5%, even though sentence  s1 is structured very differently.\n For more examples, check out the  repo and  colab notebook.

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Alan L. Hart (born Alberta Lucille Hart, October 4, 1890\u00a0\u2013 July 1, 1962) was an American physician, radiologist, tuberculosis researcher, writer and novelist. He was in 1917\u201318 one of the first  trans men to undergo  hysterectomy in the United States, and lived the rest of his life as a man. He pioneered the use of  x-ray photography in  tuberculosis detection, and helped implement TB screening programs that saved thousands of lives.  [1]\n    Hart was born October 4, 1890, in Halls Summit,  Coffey County, Kansas, to Albert L. Hart and Edna Hart (n\u00e9e Bamford). When his father died of  typhoid fever in 1892, his mother reverted to her maiden name and moved the family to  Linn County, Oregon, where she cared for her own mother during a period of sickness. When Hart was five years old his mother remarried, to Bill Barton, and the family moved to Edna&#39;s father&#39;s farm. Hart wrote later, in 1911,  ...\n As a suppressed male during his school years, Hart was allowed to write essays under his chosen name &#34;Robert Allen Bamford, Jr.&#34; with little resistance from his classmates or teachers. It was common at the time for writers to use  pseudonyms, including to assume names associated with the opposite gender. Hart published work in local newspapers and in school and college publications under this name, or as &#34;submitted by an anonymous boy&#34;,  ...\n   Hart attended Albany College (now  Lewis &amp; Clark College), then transferred with classmate and romantic partner Eva Cushman to  Stanford University for the 1911\u20131912 school year before going back to Albany.  [5] Hart graduated from Albany College in 1912, and in 1917 obtained a doctor of medicine degree from the  University of Oregon Medical Department in Portland (now  Oregon Health &amp; Science University); during this period, Hart also returned to  ...\n  Upon reaching adulthood Hart sought psychiatric  counselling and radical surgery to live as a man. Hart&#39;s was the first documented transgender male transition in the United States,  [8]  [9] though sex reassignment surgeries had been carried out earlier in Germany,  [10] including on one man, treated by German sexologist  Magnus Hirschfeld,  [11] who had won the right to serve in the German military.  [12] The 1906/07 case of  Karl M. Baerhad set a new precedent  ...\n In 1917, Hart approached Joshua Allen Gilbert, Ph.D., M.D., at the University of Oregon and requested surgery to eliminate  menstruation and the possibility of ever becoming pregnant.  [13] He also presented Gilbert with a  eugenicargument, that a person with &#34;abnormal inversion&#34; should be sterilized. Gilbert was initially reluctant, but accepted that Hart was &#34;extremely intelligent and not mentally ill, but afflicted with a mysterious disorder  ...\n Early FTM surgeries involved the implanting of testicular tissue in place of the removed ovaries.  [14] Crystalline  male hormones had been extracted in usable quantities from male urine by 1903,  [15] but it represented an infection risk. Synthetic hormones were not manufactured until 1920 (by  Bayer),  [16] and when given the opportunity, Hart underwent hormone therapy.  [17]\n Hart&#39;s surgery was completed at the University of Oregon Medical School  [18] over the 1917\u20131918 winter vacation. He then legally changed his name.\n He interned at San Francisco Hospital. A former classmate recognized him there, and he was outed as transgender in the  Spokesman-Review newspaper on Feb. 6, 1918. The article&#39;s opening sentence referred to him by his birth name and with female pronouns, describing him as having graduated from Stanford &#34;as a fluffy coed...[who] affected boyish mannerisms.&#34;  [19]\n In February 1918 he married his first wife Inez Stark and moved with her to  Gardiner, Oregon, to set up his own medical practice.\n In an interview with a local paper, Hart declared that he was &#34;happier since I made this change than I ever have in my life, and I will continue this way as long as I live [...] I have never concealed anything regarding my [change] to men&#39;s clothing [...] I came home to show my friends that I am ashamed of nothing.&#34;  [20]\n  In Oregon, Hart suffered an early blow when a former medical school classmate  outed him as transgender, forcing Hart and his wife to move. Hart found the experience traumatic and again consulted Gilbert, who wrote that Hart had suffered from &#34;the hounding process ... which our modern social organization can carry on to such perfection and refinement.&#34;. [   citation needed] Hart set up a new practice in remote  Huntley, Montana, writing later  ...\n The relocations, financial insecurity, and secrecy placed strain on Hart&#39;s marriage, and Inez left him in September 1923. She ordered him to have no further contact with her, and divorced him in 1925. The same year Hart married his second wife, Edna Ruddick; the union lasted until the end of Hart&#39;s life. In 1925 Hart moved to the  Trudeau School of Tuberculosisin New York, where he also carried out postgraduate work; he spent 1926 \u20131928  ...\n In 1948, after Hart obtained a master&#39;s degree in public health from  Yale, the couple moved to  Connecticut, where Hart had been appointed Director of Hospitalization and Rehabilitation for the Connecticut State Tuberculosis Commission. The couple lived for the rest of their lives in  West Hartford, Connecticut, where Edna became a professor at the  University of Hartford. After the  Second World Warsynthetic testosterone became available in  ...\n During the last six years of his life Hart gave numerous lectures, and dedicated all his free time to fundraising for medical research and to support patients with advanced TB who could not afford treatment. He was a member of the  American Thoracic Society,  American Public Health Association,  American Association for the Advancement of Science, and  American Civil Liberties Union, among many others. Socially, both he and Edna were well liked,  ...\n Hart died of  heart failure on July 1, 1962. The terms of his will directed his body be cremated and his ashes scattered over Puget Sound where he and Edna had spent many happy summers together.\n Hart said once, [   when?] in a speech to graduating medical students, &#34;Each of us must take into account the raw material which heredity dealt us at birth and the opportunities we have had along the way, and then work out for ourselves a sensible evaluation of our personalities and accomplishments&#34;.\n  Hart devoted much of his career to research into and treatment of  tuberculosis. In the early 20th century the disease was the biggest killer in America. Doctors, including Hart, were realizing that myriad illnesses \u2014consumption, phthisis, phthisis pulmonalis, Koch&#39;s disease, scrofula, lupus vulgaris, white plague, King&#39;s evil, Pott&#39;s disease, and Gibbus \u2014were all in fact cases of tuberculosis (TB). TB usually attacked victims&#39;  ...\n X-rays, or Roentgen rays as they were more commonly known until World War Two, had been discovered only in 1895, when Hart was five years old. In the early twentieth century they were used to detect bone fractures and tumors, but Hart became interested in their potential for detecting tuberculosis. Since the disease often presented no symptoms in its early stages, x-ray  screeningwas invaluable for early detection. Even rudimentary early  ...\n In 1937 Hart was hired by the Idaho Tuberculosis Association and later became the state&#39;s Tuberculosis Control Officer. He established up Idaho&#39;s first fixed-location and mobile TB screening clinics and spearheaded the state&#39;s war against tuberculosis. Between 1933 and 1945 Hart traveled extensively through rural Idaho, covering thousands of miles while lecturing, conducting mass TB screenings, training new staff, and treating  ...\n An experienced and accessible writer, Hart wrote widely for medical journals and popular publications, describing TB for technical and general audiences and giving advice on its prevention, detection, and cure. At the time the word &#34;tuberculosis&#34; carried a social stigma akin to venereal disease, so Hart insisted his clinics be referred to as &#34;chest clinics&#34;, himself as a &#34;chest doctor&#34;, and his patients as &#34;chest  ...\n In 1943 Hart, now recognised as preeminent in the field of tubercular Roentgenology, compiled his extensive evidence on TB and other x-ray-detectable cases into a definitive compendium,  These Mysterious Rays: A Nontechnical Discussion of the Uses of X-rays and Radium, Chiefly in Medicine (pub. Harper &amp; Brothers), still a standard text today. The book was translated into several languages, including Spanish.\n In 1948 Hart was appointed Director of Hospitalization and Rehabilitation for the Connecticut State Tuberculosis Commission. As in Idaho, Dr. Hart took charge of a massive statewide x-ray screening program for TB, emphasizing the importance of early detection and treatment. He held this position for the rest of his life, and is credited with helping contain the spread of tuberculosis in Connecticut as he had previously in the Pacific  ...\n  Alongside his medical practice and research, Hart pursued a second career as a novelist. He had in early life published in local, school, and college magazines, and later published four novels, chiefly on medical themes. His four novels incorporate semi-autobiographical themes:  The Undaunted(1936) contains a doctor, Richard Cameron, who describes himself as a &#39;cripple&#39; after his foot is amputated following persistent bone infection.  ...\n  These short stories were collected in  The Life and Career of Alberta Lucille/Dr. Alan L. Hart, with collected early writings, by Brian Booth.

Norton &amp; Company, Inc.)An overnight best-seller, Hart&#39;s first novel drew on his experiences as a small town doctor in Gardiner, Oregon. It portrayed the medical profession as increasingly venal, and was the first expos\u00e9 of the medical world by a working doctor.\n 1936  The Undaunted (Published W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.)This novel showed gay physician &#34;Sandy Farquhar&#34; pursuing a career in radiology &#34;because he thought it wouldn&#39;t matter so much in a laboratory what a man&#39;s personality was,&#34; conflicts and themes which Hart himself had experienced in his early career.\n 1937  In the Lives of Men (Published W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.)Hart&#39;s third novel was favourably reviewed for its insights into contemporary medicine, but the reviewer at a national magazine ( The Saturday Review of Literature) noted &#34;as a doctor, Hart knows surprisingly little about women&#34;.  [23]\n 1942  Doctor Finlay Sees it Through (Published by Harper &amp; Brothers)Hart&#39;s final novel, not to be confused with  A. J. Cronin&#39;s   Dr Finlay&#39;s Casebook, is considered to have influenced subsequent medical fiction.  [24]\n  After Hart&#39;s death his wife acted on his wish to establish a fund for research into  leukaemia, from which his mother had died. The interest on his estate is donated annually to the Alan L. and Edna Ruddick Hart Fund, which makes grants for research into leukaemia and its cure.\n Hart&#39;s  will, written in 1943, stipulated that his personal letters and photographs be destroyed, and this was done on his death in 1962. Hart had acted all his life to control the interpretation of his private and emotional life, and the destruction of his personal records at his death were commensurate with this goal.  [25]Believing that the secret of his personal history was safe he made no attempt to account for  ...\n  Scholarship on Hart&#39;s life has disagreed bitterly on whether he should be characterised as  transgender, or  lesbian, while activists and advocates for various groups have claimed Hart as a representative.\n Jonathan Ned Katz, who in  Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A. (1976) first identified Hart as the pseudonymous &#34;H&#34; in Joseph Gilbert&#39;s 1920s case notes, described Hart as a lesbian and depicted his case as one where contemporary strictures against lesbianism were so strong that a &#39;woman&#39; like Hart had to adopt a male identity to pursue love affairs with women.  [28]Katz contended  ...\n Against Katz&#39;s claims, others like Jillian Todd Weiss have asserted that Hart experienced himself as a man from early childhood, identifying  transphobia and &#34;blatant disregard for transgender identities&#34; in the claim that Hart was &#39;really&#39; a woman.  [31] Hart&#39;s widow refused interviews to Katz, offended by his categorization of her husband (and by extension, herself) as lesbian.  [32]\n Some historians note that Hart never described himself as transsexual, but the term was not published until the 1920s, and not widely used until the 1960s, near Hart&#39;s death.  [33]It is also true that Hart worked hard to keep his pre-transition identity secret, and would hardly have sought to publicly claim a trans identity. Others, then, have contended that Hart was a trans pioneer, who lived after his transition  ...\n Joy Parks describes the battle, especially within  Portland, Oregon  GLBT communities over Hart&#39;s identity as &#34;extremely ugly&#34; and one in which &#34;neither side appeared particularly victorious.&#34;  [34]\n    In 2002 the Aubrey Watzek Library at  Lewis &amp; Clark College ran an exhibition on Hart&#39;s life and early writings, titled  &#34;The Lives of Men&#34;: A Literary Glimpse at the Life of Alberta Lucille Hart/Dr. Alan L. Hart, a title drawing on one of Hart&#39;s novels. The exhibition&#39;s run was extended by nearly a month in light of unexpectedly high interest.\n In 1994, the story of Alan Lucille Hart and Eva Cushman&#39;s attendance at  Stanford University, along with a brief description of their subsequent lives, was included in the historical exhibition &#34;Coming to Terms: Passionate Friendship to Gay Liberation on the Farm&#34; at  Cecil H. Green Libraryat Stanford. The exhibition was curated by independent scholar Gerard Koskovich; it ran from July through October  ...\n Hart and Cushman&#39;s story also was featured in a second historical exhibition at Stanford University: &#34;Creating Queer Space at Stanford: Pages From a Student Scrapbook,&#34; which was on display in April and May 2004 in the second floor lobby of Tresidder Memorial Union on the Stanford campus.

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  The  behavioral immune system is a phrase coined by the psychological scientist  Mark Schaller to refer to a suite of psychological mechanisms that allow individual organisms to detect the potential presence of disease-causing  parasites in their immediate environment, and to engage in behaviors that prevent contact with those objects and individuals.  [1]  [2]  [3]\n These mechanisms include sensory processes through which cues connoting the presence of parasitic infections are perceived (e.g., the smell of a foul odor, the sight of  pox or  pustules), as well as  stimulus\u2013response systems through which these sensory cues trigger a cascade of aversive affective, cognitive, and behavioral reactions (e.g., arousal of  disgust, automatic activation of cognitions that connote the threat of disease, behavioral avoidance).  [2]  ...\n The existence of a behavioral immune system has been documented across many animal species, including humans. It is theorized that the mechanisms that comprise the behavioral immune system evolved as a crude first line of defense against disease-causing pathogens.  [2]\n   Within the  psychological sciences, there is extensive research linking the behavioral immune system to a variety of prejudices \u2014including prejudices against people who aren&#39;t actually diseased but are simply characterized by some sort of visual characteristics that deviate from those of a subjectively prototypical human being. The disease \u2013avoidant processes that characterize the behavioral immune system have been shown to contribute to prejudices  ...\n In addition, the behavioral immune system appears to contribute to  xenophobia and  ethnocentrism.  [8]  [9] One implication is that these prejudices tend to be exaggerated under conditions in which people feel especially vulnerable to the potential transmission of infectious diseases.\n Additional lines of research on the behavioral immune system have shown that people engage in more reticent and conservative forms of behavior under conditions in which they feel more vulnerable to disease transmission. For instance, when the potential threat of disease is made salient, people tend to be less extraverted or sociable.  [10]Evidence suggests that the behavioral immune system also incorporates mechanisms designed to search out and process  ...\n  The behavioral immune system also has consequences at a  cultural level of analysis. Under ecological circumstances in which diseases are more prevalent, people also tend to display more reticent and socially restricted forms of behavior, and human cultures are defined by more conservative norms and value systems.  [12]  [13]\n  Some research suggests that the behavioral immune system has implications for the functioning of the physiological  immune system too. One study found that the mere visual perception of diseased-looking people stimulated white blood cells to respond more aggressively to infection (as indicated by the production of the proinflammatory  cytokine  Interleukin 6 in response to a bacterial stimulus).  [14]\n Research also indicates that immune-relevant interventions which target pathogen transmission can interrupt behavioral responses. For example, receiving a flu vaccination or washing one&#39;s hands can reduce the extent of negative interpersonal and intergroup attitudes elicited by disease cues and concerns.

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  The  Joy programming language in  computer science is a  purely functional programming language that was produced by Manfred von Thun of  La Trobe University in  Melbourne,  Australia. Joy is based on composition of functions rather than  lambda calculus. It has turned out to have many similarities to  Forth, due not to design but to a sort of parallel evolution and convergence. It was also inspired by the  function-level programming style of  John Backus&#39;s  FP  ...\n   Joy is unusual (except for  function-level programming languages and some esoteric ones, such as  unlambda) in its lack of a  lambda operator, and therefore lack of  formal parameters. To illustrate this with a common example, here is how the square function might be defined in an  imperative programming language ( C):\n  The variable x is a formal parameter which is replaced by the actual value to be squared when the function is called. In a  functional language ( Scheme) the same function could be defined:\n  This is different in many ways, but it still uses the formal parameter x in the same way. In Joy the square function is defined:\n  In Joy, everything is a function that takes a  stack as an argument and returns a stack as a result. For instance, the numeral &#39;5&#39; does not represent an integer constant, but instead a short program that pushes the number 5 onto the stack.\n The  dup operator simply duplicates the top element of the stack by pushing a copy of it.\n So the square function makes a copy of the top element, and then multiplies the two top elements of the stack, leaving the square of the original top element at the top of the stack, with no need for a formal parameter. This makes Joy concise, as illustrated by this definition of  quicksort:\n  &#34;binrec&#34; is one of Joy&#39;s many  recursive  combinators, implementing binary recursion. It expects four quoted programs on top of the stack which represent:\n the termination condition (if a list is &#34;small&#34; (1 or 0 elements) it is already sorted),\n  what to do by default (split the list into two halves by comparing each element with the pivot), and finally\n  In Joy, the  meaning function is a  homomorphism from the  syntactic  monoid onto the  semantic  monoid. That is, the syntactic relation of  concatenation of  symbols maps directly onto the semantic relation of  composition of  functions. It is a  homomorphism rather than an  isomorphism, because it is  onto but not  one-to-one; that is, no symbol has more than one meaning, but some sequences of symbols have the same meaning (e.g. &#34;dup +&#34; and &#34;2 *&#34;).\n Joy is a  concatenative programming language: &#34;The concatenation of two programs denotes the composition of the functions denoted by the two programs&#34;.  [2]\n Its library routines mirror those of ISO  C, though the current implementation is not easily extensible with functions written in C.\n    ^   Manfred von Thun (December 12, 2003).  &#34;A Conversation with Manfred von Thun&#34; .   In the early 1980s I came across the famous Backus paper &#34;Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style,&#34; and I was immediately intrigued by the higher level of programming in his FP.\n  von Thun, Manfred;  Thomas, Reuben (October 9, 2001).  &#34;Joy: Forth&#39;s Functional Cousin&#34;  (PDF).

The earnings from music and merchandise amounted to 15x Bandcamp\u2019s normal haul for a 24-hour period, with 11 items being sold per second.\n Earlier this week, the site said that it would  continue to do so for the first Friday of the next three months. That includes June 5, July 3 and today. Don\u2019t know where to start? Might I recommend checking out the new album  Ultrasonic from Field Works?\u00a0It\u2019s a lovely and engrossing ambient work built using field recordings of the endangered Indiana bats. Haven\u2019t bats had it rough enough of late?\n If you need further recommendations, 150 artists and labels are also participating in a number of different ways. Some, like Arts &amp; Crafts, Kill Rock Stars, Sub Pop, Saddlecreek, Merge and Matador are also giving all of the revenue to artists. Others like Cloud Nothings, Deerhoof and my personal favorite, The Hold Steady, have released new material. Others, like Cooking Vinyl and Sufjan Stevens, are giving proceeds to related charity. Here\u2019s  the full list.\n Seems like a nice win-win all around.

Thanks for all the quick answers! \u2013\u00a0 raylu\n  @MartijnPieters While typing my answer I thought this must have been asked before, but I guess it can be difficult to google. This  question could be another duplicate. \u2013\u00a0 jorgeca\n  Related to my question:  Why does (1 in [1,0] == True) evaluate to False? \u2013\u00a0 Peter Wood\n  I think this would make an excellent interview question for someone who answers &#34;10&#34; to the question &#34;on a scale of 1 to 10, how are your python skills&#34;? \u2013\u00a0 Bryan Oakley\n   This can be surprising in this case, but lets you write  1 &lt;= x &lt; 4 unlike in other languages like C.\n  @NullUserException Mmm I think they can&#39;t be needed because the possible operators are  &#34;&lt;&#34; | &#34;&gt;&#34; | &#34;==&#34; | &#34;&gt;=&#34; | &#34;&lt;=&#34; | &#34;&lt;&gt;&#34; | &#34;!=&#34; | &#34;is&#34; [&#34;not&#34;] | [&#34;not&#34;] &#34;in&#34; which all have less precedence than  and. (By the way, thanks for the grammar fix, that really helps us non native speakers). \u2013\u00a0 jorgeca\n  And this is exactly why I tend to wrap compound logical comparisons in parens, I simply can&#39;t remember the syntax across all the languages I use, and it&#39;s not worth the risk of leaving them off and having unexpected behavior. \u2013\u00a0 zzzzBov\n    x &lt; y &lt;= z is equivalent to x &lt; y and y &lt;= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x &lt; y is found to be false).\n In your case  True == False is False is equivalent to  True == False and False is False as the first condition is  False so it short-circuits and return  False.\n &gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(lambda : True == False is False) 1 0 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 (True) 3 LOAD_GLOBAL 1 (False) 6 DUP_TOP 7 ROT_THREE 8 COMPARE_OP 2 (==) 11 JUMP_IF_FALSE_OR_POP 21 &lt;---------this step 14 LOAD_GLOBAL 1 (False) 17 COMPARE_OP 8 (is) 20 RETURN_VALUE &gt;&gt; 21 ROT_TWO 22 POP_TOP 23 RETURN_VALUE\n  I didn&#39;t downvote, but it seems to me that the description of the language&#39;s rules is quite enough to understand what&#39;s going on. The disassembly doesn&#39;t seem to add much (other than a focus on implementation-specific details). \u2013\u00a0 cHao\n   Unlike C, all comparison operations in Python have the same priority, which is lower than that of any arithmetic, shifting or bitwise operation. Also unlike C, expressions like a &lt; b &lt; c have the interpretation that is conventional in mathematics:\n comparison ::= or_expr ( comp_operator or_expr )*comp_operator ::= &#34;&lt;&#34; | &#34;&gt;&#34; | &#34;==&#34; | &#34;&gt;=&#34; | &#34;&lt;=&#34; | &#34;&lt;&gt;&#34; | &#34;!=&#34; | &#34;is&#34; [&#34;not&#34;] | [&#34;not&#34;] &#34;in&#34;\n   True == False is False is a chained comparison, which means the same as  (True == False) and (False is False). Since the first comparison ( True==False) is false, the result of the chained comparison is False.\n  Not the answer you&#39;re looking for?

"note_en": "Upon re-reading  Mathematical Apocrypha,a collection of tales dealing with great mathematicians as well as theirquirks and foibles, I thought about my own interactions with some of TheElders of Mathematics\u00a0(from here on abbreviated as THEM) and what Iwould add to such a book. While I have a few interesting and potentiallyfunny anecdotes to tell, one story stands out in my mind, because it hadan extraordinarily positive impact on my life.\n  When I started studying mathematics, I fell in with the wrong crowd, onecould say. Most of them had received additional tutoring  prior to evenstarting their studies  1, they knew all the things about eldritch loresuch as  complex numbers  2 and  vector spaces. Most of them, throughno fault of their own, came from every affluent and academic households,whereas my own origins are more down-to-earth and thrifty. So, to make along story short, I was in  aweof them: they seemed to know everythingabout  ...\n  Looking back with some wisdom now, I groan inwardly at this sorry way ofattempting to assert dominance. It certainly worked for me, though, as Iwas feeling increasingly out of place. Understanding all concepts took asizeable amount of time and intellectual effort for me, and I was not inthe-\u2018I-immediately-get-everything-when-being-exposed-to-it-for-the-firsttime-ever\u2019 frame of mind. So, in short, I was miserable, but I continuedto study, wondering sometimes whether I really was  thatmuch slower  ...\n  I was happy to see the second term, though, and still hung out with thisgroup at times. We were reduced in numbers, but the general tone was oneof \u2018smarter-than-thou\u2019 still and not changing. Yet, things  did change,mostly because of one course: linear algebra 2. It was given by  Prof.Matthias Kreck, who wasalso the teacher of the first instalment of the course. But Prof. Kreckdecided to go \u2018off-script \u2019and started quicklyveering off into the realms of algebraic and differential topology,trying  ...\n For me, the subject was breath of fresh air: Prof. Kreck has a veryidiosyncratic teaching style: at one point, he brought his cello intothe lecture hall to play a song; in another lecture, he took of hisleather belt, made it into a  M\u00f6bius loop,and started using chalk to draw little arrows on it \u2014this was all doneto empirically show that this particular object cannot be oriented.I loved these glimpses of topology, and I started to be interested inthe whole topic \u2014I even started reading current  ...\n  At some point, my \u2018research\u2019 made me stumble on the work by  GrigoriPerelman on the  Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture. This was my first contact with THEM.Thanks to the arXiv, I was able to browse away and discovered a treasuretrove of papers. At some point, I even discovered a paper by none otherthan  Terence Tao, who wasproviding a  non-linear PDEperspective on the proof ofPerelman.\n Wading through all that literature was daunting \u2014I had to look upalmost every other concept (Ricci flow is not part of the standardundergraduate curriculum if you are in your second semester), but I wasdetermined to go through with this, and a crazy plan formed: I wanted tofully understand the proof of the conjecture! But I needed more toolsfor that. So, at some point, I cornered Prof. Kreck after a lecture. Hewas always happy to answer questions of the students, and even though Ifound  ...\n I screwed up my courage, approached the great sage, and asked himsomething along the lines of \u2018Prof. Kreck, I really would love tounderstand the proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Do you have any tipsfor me?\u2019 He looked at me calmly and replied something like \u2018Not really,but best of luck to you; maybe  you can it explain it to  me once you understand it.\u2019\n I was absolutely  flummoxed! Here is a member of THEM, confessing hisown ignorance of a subject! Prof. Kreck expanded a little bit on thisanswer and basically explained to me that it might takes  yearsofstudying to finally grasp all the nuances of the proof and, since it wasnot directly within his realm of expertise in topology, he was justas clueless about certain concepts than I was. The major differencebeing that he was more experienced at feeling clueless, and knew moreconcepts for  ...\n Similar to the novice in many of the Zen koans, I truly was enlightened in this moment. If one of THEM can express ignorance abouta topic, surely, ignorance is not that bad to begin with. I realisedthat the power of truly mastering a subject lies in realising that youdo  not necessarily understand everything\u2014and being honest about it!My life was changed  6, and I was gently steered towards being moreintellectually honest.\n  There  isa power in being as honest and outspoken as Prof. Kreck was.Here is this proficient and prolific member of THEM, and he could havejust made up something on the spot to make me feel dumb. Instead, hechose the intellectually honest option, and made it clear that this isthe normal state of affairs in mathematics (or any sufficientlycomplicated topic). I relish the fact that such a small action couldhave such a profound impact on one person, and I am grateful thatI dared pose my  ...\n In the years since, in my own dealings with researchers, I never oncefeigned knowledge when I was not feeling sufficiently confident aboutit. I think it is important to be honest about what you know and whatyou do  not know. Ignorance is not a moral blemish\u2014 pretending tobe smarter than you are  is\u00a0(just as choosing to remain in astate of ignorance is).\n So the moral of this story is: do not be afraid of not knowing or notunderstanding something. It even happens to THEM.\n Whereas I did not even  know that such a thing was possible, andstarted studies woefully under-prepared\u2014or so I thought.  \u21a9\ufe0e\n It  was the first term for me, and while I had heard about thisin high school, it was being talked about in hushed voices, similar tohow one would talk about certain things of an immoral nature. The factthat complex numbers somehow arose in equations that did not havea \u2018real\u2019 solution, made them all the more advanced to me at that time.  \u21a9\ufe0e\n It would only later dawn on me that they were probably just fullof manure the whole time, but this wisdom was acquired over the yearsand not accessible at the time that I needed it.  \u21a9\ufe0e\n By that time, I was so accustomed to being \u2018in over my head\u2019 thatthere was really nothing that could knock me off balance any more. Itwas a mild surprise to see that I  could follow along with somepapers for at least a few paragraphs, or pages, until I started todrown in unfamiliar terminology and jargon.  \u21a9\ufe0e\n  Again, I only properly realised this much later, but thiscertainly was a  change point in my career!  \u21a9\ufe0e", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:59", "tags": "\u65e0\u77e5,admitting,\u6570\u5b66,started",

"note_en": "Awk is a tiny programming language and a command line tool. It&#39;sparticularly appropriate for log parsing on servers, mostly because Awk willoperate on files, usually structured in lines of human-readable text.\n I say it&#39;s useful on servers because log files, dump files, or whatevertext format servers end up dumping to disk will tend to grow large, and you&#39;llhave many of them per server. If you ever get into the situation where you haveto analyze gigabytes of files from 50 different servers without tools like Splunk or its equivalents, it would feelfairly bad to have and download all these files locally to then drive someforensics on them.\n This personally happens to me when some Erlang nodes tend to die andleave a  crashdump of 700MB to 4GB behind, or on smaller individual servers (say a VPS)where I need to quickly go through logs, looking for a common pattern.\n In any case, Awk does more than finding data (otherwise,  grepor  ack would be enough) \u2014 it also lets you process thedata and transform it.\n   # comment Pattern1  {  ACTIONS ;  } # comment Pattern2  {  ACTIONS ;  } # comment Pattern3  {  ACTIONS ;  } # comment Pattern4  {  ACTIONS ;  }\n Every line of the document to scan will have to go through each of thepatterns, one at a time. So if I pass in a file that contains the followingcontent:\n  Then the content  this is line 1 will match against Pattern1. If it matches,  ACTIONS will be executed.Then  this is line 1 will match against  Pattern2.If it doesn&#39;t match, it skips to  Pattern3, and so on.\n Once all patterns have been cleared,  this is line 2 will gothrough the same process, and so on for other lines, until the input has beenread entirely.\n   Awk only has two main data types: strings and numbers. And even then,Awk likes to convert them into each other. Strings can be interpretedas numerals to convert their values to numbers. If the string doesn&#39;tlook like a numeral, it&#39;s  0.\n Both can be assigned to variables in  ACTIONS parts of your codewith the  = operator. Variables can be declared anywhere, at anytime, and used even if they&#39;re not initialized: their default value is &#34;&#34;, the empty string.\n Finally, Awk has arrays. They&#39;re unidimensional associative arraysthat can be started dynamically. Their syntax is just var[key] = value. Awk can  simulate multidimensional arrays, but it&#39;s all a big hack anyway.\n  The patterns that can be used will fall into three broad categories:regular expressions, Boolean expressions, and special patterns.\n  The Awk regular expressions are your run of the mill regexes. They&#39;re notPCRE under  awk (but  gawk will support the fancierstuff \u2014 it depends on the implementation! See with  awk--version), though for most usages they&#39;ll do plenty:\n /admin/  {  ...  }  # any line that contains &#39;admin&#39; /^admin/  {  ...  }  # lines that begin with &#39;admin&#39; /admin$/  {  ...  }  # lines that end with &#39;admin&#39; /^[0-9.]+ /  {  ...  }  # lines beginning with series of numbers and periods /(POST|PUT|DELETE)/  # lines that contain specific HTTP verbs\n And so on. Note that the patterns  cannot capture specificgroups to make them available in the  ACTIONS part of the code.They are specifically to match content.\n Boolean expressions are similar to what you would find in PHP or Javascript.Specifically, the operators  &amp;&amp; (&#34;and&#34;),  ||(&#34;or&#34;), and  ! (&#34;not&#34;) are available. This is also what you&#39;ll findin pretty much all C-like languages. They&#39;ll operate on any regular data type.\n What&#39;s specifically more like PHP and Javascript is the comparison operator, ==, which will do fuzzy matching, so that the string &#34;23&#34; compares equal to the number  23, such that &#34;23&#34; == 23 is  true. The operator  != is alsoavailable, without forgetting the other common ones:  &gt;, &lt;,  &gt;=, and  &lt;=. You can also mix up the patterns: Boolean expressions can be used along withregular expressions. The pattern  /admin/ || debug == trueis validand will match when a  ...\n Note that if you have a specific string or variable you&#39;d want to matchagainst a regex, the operators  ~ and  !~ are whatyou want, to be used as  string ~ /regex/  ...\n      The first one is  BEGIN, which matches only  beforeany line has been input to the file. This is basically where you can initiatevariables and all other kinds of state  ...\n There is also  END, which as you may have guessed, will match afterthe whole input has been handled. This lets you clean up ordo some final output before exiting.  ...\n Finally, the last kind of pattern is a bit hard to classify. It&#39;s halfwaybetween variables and special values, and they&#39;re called  Fields, whichdeserve  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:56", "tags": "awk,\u6587\u4ef6", "title":

"note_en": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas.\n  Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government on Friday said India - the country with the largest number of people in lockdown - would extends its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 illness, but allow \u201cconsiderable relaxations\u201d in lower-risk districts.\n As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu - meaning Health Bridge - a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country\u2019s National Informatics Centre. The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for COVID-19 or deemed to be at high risk.\n \u201cUse of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public,\u201d India\u2019s Ministry of Home Affairs said in a notification late on Friday.\n It will the responsibility of the heads of companies and organizations \u201cto ensure 100% coverage of this app among the employees,\u201d the ministry said.\n Officials at India\u2019s technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people.\n The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India\u2019s smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google Play Store data.\n The app\u2019s compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app.\n \u201cSuch a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body,\u201d said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla.\n New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously.\n The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better-target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding that information on the app is used \u201conly for administering necessary medical interventions\u201d.\n On Friday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:54", "tags": "\u7a0b\u5e8f,app,\u5f3a\u5236,government,\u5370\u5ea6", "title": "\u5370\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5236\u8981\u6c42\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u653f\u5e9c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f", "title_en": "India makes government tracing app mandatory for all workers", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-india-app/india-makes-government-tracing-app-mandatory-for-all-workers-idUSKBN22E07K", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u7a0b\u5e8f", "app", "\u5f3a\u5236", "\u5370\u5ea6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000309, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u53ea\u9700\u5305\u542b\u96c6\u6210\u4e00\u7ae0\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e93\uff0cBypassProvider\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u5c01\u60a8\u7684\u8fdb\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u8bbf\u95ee\u9690\u85cf\u7684API\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bf7\u521b\u5efa\u9519\u8bef\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u672c\u7ae0\u5c4a\u65f6\u5c06\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5bf9\u6211\u7684\u85cf\u4e66\u6ee1\u610f\uff0c\u8bf7\u7ed9\u6211\u70b9\u4e00\u676f\u5496\u5561\uff1b)\u8c22\u8c22\u3002", "note_en": "Just include the library as explained in the Integration chapter.The BypassProvider will automatically unseal your process and allow you to access hidden api.\n  Please create a bug report if you find any issues.
