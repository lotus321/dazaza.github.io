"note_en": "Software development teams find life can be much easier if they integrate their work as often as they can. They also find it valuable to release frequently into production. But teams don&#39;t want to expose half-developed features to their users. A useful technique to deal with this tension is to build all the back-end code, integrate, but don&#39;t build the user-interface. The feature can be integrated and tested, but the UI is held back until the end until, like a keystone, it&#39;s added to  ...\n A simple example of this technique might be to give a customer the option of a rush order. Such an order needs to be priced, depending on where the customer lives and what delivery companies operate there. The nature of the goods involved affects the picking approach used in the warehouse. Certain customers may qualify to have rush orders available to them, which may also depend on the delivery location, the time of year, and the kind of goods ordered.\n All in all that&#39;s a fair bit of business logic, particularly since it will involve gnarly integration with various warehousing, catalog, and customer service systems. Doing this could take several weeks, while other features, need to be released every few days. But as far as the user is concerned, a rush order is just a check-box on the order form.\n To build this using the check-box as the keystone, the team does development work on the underlying business logic and interfaces to internal systems over the course of several production releases. The user is unaware of all this latent code. Only with the last step does the keystone check-box need to be made visible, which can be done in a relatively short time. This way all latent code can be integrated and be part of the system going into production, reducing the problems that come with a long-lived  ...\n  The latent code does need to be tested to the same degree of confidence that it would be if it were active. This can be done providing the architecture of the system is setup so that most testing isn&#39;t done through the user interface.  Unit Tests and other lower layers of the  Test Pyramid should be easy to run this way. Even  Broad Stack Tests can be run providing there is a mechanism to make them  Subcutaneous Tests. In some cases there will a significant amount of behavior within the UI itself,  ...\n Not all applications are built in such a way that they can be extensively tested in a subcutaneous manner - but the effort required to do this is worthwhile even without the capability to use a keystone. Tests running through the UI are always more trouble to setup, even with the best tools to automate the process. Moving more tests to subcutaneous and lower level tests, especially unit tests, can dramatically speed up  Deployment Pipelines and enable  Continuous Delivery.\n Of course, most UIs will be more than a check-box, although often they aren&#39;t that much more work to keystone. In a web app, a complex feature will often be an independent web page, that can be built and tested in full, and the keystone is merely a link. A desktop may have several screens where the keystone is the menu-item to make them visible.\n That said, there are cases when the UI can&#39;t be packaged into a simple keystone. When that&#39;s the case then it&#39;s time to use  Feature Toggles. Even in this case, however, thinking of a keystone can be useful by ensuring that the feature toggle only applies to the UI. This avoids scattering lots of toggle points through the back end code, reduces the complexity of applying the toggle, allows the use of  simple toggle mechanisms, and makes it easier to remove when the time comes.\n There is a general danger with developing a UI last, in that the back-end code may be designed in a way that doesn&#39;t work with the UI once it&#39;s built, or the UI isn&#39;t given the attention it needs until late, leading to a lack of iteration and a poor user experience. For those reasons a keystone approach works best within an overall approach that encourages building a product through thin vertical slices that lead to releasing small but fully working features rapidly.\n I&#39;ve used the example of a user-interface here, but of course the same approach can be used with any other interface, such as an API. By building the consumer&#39;s interface last, and keeping it simple, we can build and integrate even large features in small chunks.\n Dark Launching is a variation where the new feature is called once its built, but no results are shown to the user. This is done to measure the impact on the back-end systems, which is useful for some changes. Once all is good, we can add the keystone.\n I first came across the metaphor of a keystone for this technique in the second edition of Kent Beck&#39;s  Extreme Programming Explained .

"note_en": "One of the questions I get asked the most these days is when the world will be able to go back to the way things were in December before the coronavirus pandemic. My answer is always the same: when we have an almost perfect drug to treat COVID-19, or when almost every person on the planet has been vaccinated against coronavirus.\n The former is unlikely to happen anytime soon. We\u2019d need a miracle treatment that was at least 95 percent effective to stop the outbreak. Most of the  drug candidates right now are nowhere near that powerful. They could save a lot of lives, but they aren\u2019t enough to get us back to normal.\n  Humankind has never had a more urgent task than creating broad immunity for coronavirus. Realistically, if we\u2019re going to return to normal, we need to develop a safe, effective vaccine. We need to make billions of doses, we need to get them out to every part of the world, and we need all of this to happen as quickly as possible.\n That sounds daunting, because it is. Our foundation is the biggest funder of vaccines in the world, and this effort dwarfs anything we\u2019ve ever worked on before. It\u2019s going to require a global cooperative effort like the world has never seen. But I know it\u2019ll get done. There\u2019s simply no alternative.\n Here\u2019s what you need to know about the race to create a COVID-19 vaccine.\n  Dr. Anthony Fauci has said he thinks it\u2019ll take around eighteen months to develop a coronavirus vaccine. I agree with him, though it could be as little as 9 months or as long as two years.\n Although eighteen months might sound like a long time, this would be the fastest scientists have created a new vaccine. Development usually takes around five years. Once you pick a disease to target, you have to create the vaccine and test it on animals. Then you begin testing for safety and efficacy in humans.\n Safety and efficacy are the two most important goals for every vaccine.  Safety is exactly what it sounds like: is the vaccine safe to give to people? Some minor side effects (like a mild fever or injection site pain) can be acceptable, but you don\u2019t want to inoculate people with something that makes them sick.\n Efficacy measures how well the vaccine protects you from getting sick. Although you\u2019d ideally want a vaccine to have 100 percent efficacy, many don\u2019t. For example, this year\u2019s flu vaccine is  around 45 percent effective.\n  Phase one is the safety trial. A small group of healthy volunteers gets the vaccine candidate. You try out different dosages to create the strongest immune response at the lowest effective dose without serious side effects.\n  Once you\u2019ve settled on a formula, you move onto  phase two, which tells you how well the vaccine works in the people who are intended to get it. This time, hundreds of people get the vaccine. This cohort should include people of different ages and health statuses.\n  Then, in  phase three, you give it to thousands of people. This is usually the longest phase, because it occurs in what\u2019s called \u201cnatural disease conditions.\u201d You introduce it to a large group of people who are likely already at the risk of infection by the target pathogen, and then wait and see if the vaccine reduces how many people get sick.\n After the vaccine passes all three trial phases, you start building the factories to manufacture it, and it gets submitted to the WHO and various government agencies for approval.\n This process works well for most vaccines, but the normal development timeline isn\u2019t good enough right now. Every day we can cut from this process will make a huge difference to the world in terms of saving lives and reducing trillions of dollars in economic damage.\n So, to speed up the process, vaccine developers are compressing the timeline. This graphic shows how:\n       In the traditional process, the steps are sequential to address key questions and unknowns. This can help mitigate financial risk, since creating a new vaccine is expensive. Many candidates fail, which is why companies wait to invest in the next step until they know the previous step was successful.\n For COVID-19, financing development is not an issue. Governments and other organizations (including our foundation and an amazing alliance called the  Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) have made it clear they will support whatever it takes to find a vaccine. So, scientists are able to save time by doing several of the development steps at once. For example, the private sector, governments, and our foundation are going to start identifying facilities to manufacture  ...\n Fortunately, compressing the trial timeline isn\u2019t the only way to take a process that usually takes five years and get it done in 18 months. Another way we\u2019re going to do that is by testing lots of different approaches at the same time.\n  As of April 9, there are  115 different COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the development pipeline. I think that eight to ten of those look particularly promising. (Our foundation is going to keep an eye on all the others to see if we missed any that have some positive characteristics, though.)\n     The most promising candidates take a variety of approaches to protecting the body against COVID-19. To understand what exactly that means, it\u2019s helpful to remember how the human immune system works.\n When a disease pathogen gets into your system, your immune system responds by producing antibodies. These antibodies attach themselves to substances called  antigens on the surface of the microbe, which sends a signal to your body to attack. Your immune system keeps a record of every microbe it has ever defeated, so that it can quickly recognize and destroy invaders before they make you ill.\n Vaccines circumvent this whole process by teaching your body how to defeat a pathogen without ever getting sick. The two most common types\u2014and the ones you\u2019re probably most familiar with\u2014are inactivated and live  vaccines. Inactivated vaccines contain pathogens that have been killed. Live vaccines, on the other hand, are made of living pathogens that have been weakened (or \u201cattenuated \u201d). They \u2019re highly effective but more prone to side effects than their inactivated  ...\n Inactivated and live vaccines are what we consider \u201ctraditional\u201d approaches. There are a number of COVID-19 vaccine candidates of both types, and for good reason: they\u2019re well-established. We know how to test and manufacture them.\n The downside is that they\u2019re time-consuming to make. There\u2019s a ton of material in each dose of a vaccine. Most of that material is biological, which means you have to grow it. That takes time, unfortunately.\n That\u2019s why I\u2019m particularly excited by two new approaches that some of the candidates are taking:  RNA and DNA vaccines. If one of these new approaches pans out, we\u2019ll likely be able to get vaccines out to the whole world much faster. (For the sake of simplicity, I\u2019m only going to explain RNA vaccines. DNA vaccines are similar, just with a different type of genetic material and method of administration.)\n Our foundation\u2014both through our own funding and through  CEPI\u2014has been supporting the development of an RNA vaccine platform for nearly a decade. We were planning to use it to make vaccines for diseases that affect the poor like malaria, but now it\u2019s looking like one of the most promising options for COVID. The first candidate to start human trials was an RNA vaccine created by a company called Moderna.\n Here\u2019s how an RNA vaccine works: rather than injecting a pathogen\u2019s antigen into your body, you instead give the body the genetic code needed to produce that antigen itself. When the antigens appear on the outside of your cells, your immune system attacks them\u2014and learns how to defeat future intruders in the process. You essentially turn your body into its own vaccine manufacturing unit.\n Because RNA vaccines let your body do most of the work, they don \u2019t require much material. That makes them much faster to manufacture. There \u2019s a catch, though: we don \u2019t know for sure yet if RNA is a viable platform for vaccines. Since COVID would be the first RNA vaccine out of the gate, we have to prove both that the platform itself works and that it creates immunity. It \u2019s a bit like building your computer system and your first piece of software at the same  ...\n Even if an RNA vaccine continues to show promise, we still must continue pursuing the other options. We don\u2019t know yet what the COVID-19 vaccine will look like. Until we do, we have to go full steam ahead on as many approaches as possible.\n  The smallpox vaccine is the only vaccine that\u2019s wiped an entire disease off the face of the earth, but it\u2019s also pretty brutal to receive. It left a scar on the arm of anyone who got it. One out of every three people had side effects bad enough to keep them home from school or work. A small\u2014but not insignificant\u2014number developed more serious reactions.\n The smallpox vaccine was far from perfect, but it got the job done. The COVID-19 vaccine might be similar.\n If we were designing the perfect vaccine, we\u2019d want it to be completely safe and 100 percent effective. It should be a single dose that gives you lifelong protection, and it should be easy to store and transport. I hope the COVID-19 vaccine has all of those qualities, but given the timeline we\u2019re on, it may not.\n The two priorities, as I mentioned earlier, are  safety and  efficacy. Since we might not have time to do multi-year studies, we will have to conduct robust phase 1 safety trials and make sure we have good real-world evidence that the vaccine is completely safe to use.\n We have a bit more wiggle room with efficacy. I suspect a vaccine that is at least 70 percent effective will be enough to stop the outbreak. A 60 percent effective vaccine is useable, but we might still see some localized outbreaks. Anything under 60 percent is unlikely to create enough herd immunity to stop the virus.\n The big challenge will be making sure the vaccine works well in older people. The older you are, the less effective vaccines are. Your immune system\u2014like the rest of your body\u2014ages and is slower to recognize and attack invaders. That\u2019s a big issue for a COVID-19 vaccine, since older people are the most vulnerable. We need to make sure they\u2019re protected.\n The shingles vaccine\u2014which is also targeted to older people\u2014combats this by amping up the strength of the vaccine. It\u2019s possible we do something similar for COVID, although it might come with more side effects. Health authorities could also ask people over a certain age to get an additional dose.\n  How many doses will it be? A vaccine you only get once is easier and quicker to deliver. But we may need a multi-dose vaccine to get enough efficacy.\n  How long does it last? Ideally, the vaccine will give you long-lasting protection. But we might end up with one that only stops you from getting sick for a couple months (like the seasonal flu vaccine, which protects you for about six months). If that happens, the short-term vaccine might be used while we work on a more durable one.\n  How do you store it? Many common vaccines are kept at 4 degrees C. That\u2019s around the temperature of your average refrigerator, so storage and transportation is easy. But RNA vaccines need to be stored at much colder temperature\u2014as low as -80 degrees C\u2014which will make reaching certain parts of the world more difficult.\n My hope is that the vaccine we have 18 months from now is as close to \u201cperfect\u201d as possible. Even if it isn\u2019t, we will continue working to improve it. After that happens, I suspect the COVID-19 vaccine will become part of the routine newborn immunization schedule.\n Once we have a vaccine, though, we still have huge problems to solve. That\u2019s because\u2026\n  In order to stop the pandemic, we need to make the vaccine available to almost every person on the planet. We\u2019ve never delivered something to every corner of the world before. And, as I mentioned earlier, vaccines are particularly difficult to make and store.\n There\u2019s a lot we can\u2019t figure out about manufacturing and distributing the vaccine until we know what exactly we\u2019re working with. For example, will we be able to use existing vaccine factories to make the COVID-19 vaccine?\n What we can do now is build different kinds of vaccine factories to prepare. Each vaccine type requires a different kind of factory. We need to be ready with facilities that can make each type, so that we can start manufacturing the final vaccine (or vaccines) as soon as we can. This will cost billions of dollars. Governments need to quickly find a mechanism for making the funding for this available. Our foundation is currently working with CEPI,  ...\n Part of those discussions center on who will get the vaccine when. The reality is that not everyone will be able to get the vaccine at the same time. It\u2019ll take months\u2014or even years\u2014to create 7 billion doses (or possibly 14 billion, if it\u2019s a multi-dose vaccine), and we should start distributing them as soon as the first batch is ready to go.\n Most people agree that health workers should get the vaccine first. But who gets it next? Older people? Teachers? Workers in essential jobs?\n I think that low-income countries should be some of the first to receive it, because people will be at a much higher risk of dying in those places. COVID-19 will spread much quicker in poor countries because measures like physical distancing are harder to enact. More people have poor underlying health that makes them more vulnerable to complications, and weak health systems will make it harder for them to receive the care they need. Getting the  ...\n With most vaccines, manufacturers sign a deal with the country where their factories are located, so that country gets first crack at the vaccines. It\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s what will happen here. I hope we find a way to get it out on an equitable basis to the whole world. The WHO and national health authorities will need to develop a distribution plan once we have a better understanding of what we\u2019re working with.\n Eventually, though, we\u2019re going to scale this thing up so that the vaccine is available to everyone.

It\u2019s also dropping the price of the service by more than 50% and giving developers the option to run it on relatively low-performance virtual machines that will start at $0.08 per hour.\n In today\u2019s announcement, Microsoft\u2019s Nik Molnar points out that the company learned that most developers who used Visual Studio Online thought of it as being much more than simply an editor in the browser.\n   \u201cTo better align with that sentiment, and the true value of the service, we\u2019re renaming Visual Studio Online to Visual Studio Codespaces. (It\u2019s true what they say, naming is hard!) Do you want a great experience working on your long-term project? Do it in a Codespace. Need to quickly prototype a new feature or perform some short-term tasks (like reviewing pull requests)? Create a Codespace! Your Codespaces are simply the most productive place to code.\u201d\n The new pricing will go into effect on May 19, the first day of Microsoft\u2019s (virtual) Build developer conference. These are pretty significant price drops, down from $0.45 per hour to $0.17 for a machine with 4 cores and 8 GB of memory, for example (you also incur some relatively minor storage costs of $0.0088 for using a 64 GB SDD, too).\n  Molnar also points out that a lot of developers don\u2019t need quite that much power, so the company is now introducing a Basic plan with a 2-core machine and 4 GB of RAM for $0.08 per hour. Best I can tell, these will go live for around $0.24 per hour today and then see a price cut on May 19, too. Why not launch it at the reduced price? Only Microsoft knows, so we asked and will update this post once they tell us.\n Typically, this is the kind of announcement Microsoft would make at its annual Build developer conference. And while some other companies have decided to fully scrap their events and aren\u2019t even hosting a virtual conference, Microsoft is moving full steam ahead with its Build conference in the middle of May. I expect in the near future we\u2019ll hear more about how that event will play out.\n Correction:  we mistakenly attributed the Microsoft blog post to\u00a0 Microsoft\u2019s Scot Hanselman, but it was Nik Molnar who wrote it.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:56:30", "tags": "microsoft,visual,\u4ef7\u683c", "title": "Microsoft\u7684Visual Studio Online\u73b0\u5728\u662fVisual Studio Codespaces\uff1b\u964d\u4ef750%", "title_en": "Microsoft\u2019s Visual Studio Online is now Visual Studio Codespaces; 50% price drop", "transed": 0, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/microsofts-visual-studio-online-code-editor-is-now-visual-studio-codespaces-and-gets-a-price-drop/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["microsoft", "visual", "\u4ef7\u683c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "fd02ffdee6db11f3587038c5b6ea3833.png", "infoid": 1000177, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6628\u665a(4\u670830\u65e5)\u516c\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u8d1f\u503a\u8868\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e03\u5929\u91cc\u53c8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86830\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u51e0\u5468\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u7684\u653e\u7f13\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0e\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u4ecd\u7136\u5feb\u5f97\u4ee4\u4eba\u773c\u82b1\u7f2d\u4e71\u3002\n\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e03\u5929\u7684\u201c\u5370\u949e\u201d\u89c4\u6a21\u4e3a830\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u800c\u524d\u4e00\u5468\u4e3a2050\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u622a\u81f33\u670825\u65e5\u7684\u4e03\u5929\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u4e3a5860\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e00\u5468\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u8d44\u4ea7\u8d1f\u503a\u8868\u7684\u589e\u957f\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u7531620\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u56fd\u5e93\u5238\u6784\u6210\u3002\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u8fd8\u7565\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u56de\u8d2d(+7.02\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143)\uff0c\u5411\u5176\u7279\u6b8a\u76ee\u7684\u8f7d\u4f53\u7684\u5b57\u6bcd\u6c64\u989d\u5916\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8610\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8d37\u6b3e\uff0c\u5e76\u53c8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86290\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u592e\u884c\u8d27\u5e01\u6389\u671f\u3002\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u652f\u6301\u8bc1\u5238(MBS)\u4e0a\u635f\u5931\u4e86177\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u524d\u4e00\u5468\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8fd1300\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n\u5e02\u573a\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e07\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u6062\u590d\u5230\u957f\u671f\u589e\u957f\u7387\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u8d1f\u503a\u8868\u89c4\u6a21\u4f1a\u6709\u591a\u5927\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u56de\u5230\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u7206\u53d1\u524d\u6bcf\u6708600\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u589e\u957f\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e5f\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9065\u8fdc\u7684\u68a6\u60f3\u3002\n\u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u7ebf\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u65b0\u6587\u7ae0\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u662f\u5426\u5e0c\u671b\u6536\u5230\u901a\u77e5\uff1f/\u5355\u51fb\u6b64\u5904\u514d\u8d39\u8ba2\u9605\u3002", "note_en": "Data released last night (April 30th) reveals that the Fed\u2019s balance sheet grew by another $83 billion over the past seven days, a considerable slowdown compared to recent weeks, although still a blindingly fast pace compared to pre-Coronavirus times.\n   The past seven days\u2019 $83 billion of \u2018printing\u2019 by the Fed compares to $205 billion the week prior and a peak of $586 billion for the seven day period ending March 25th.\n   Most of the growth in the Fed\u2019s balance sheet over the past week consisted of $62 billion of treasury securities. The Fed also slightly increased its repos (+$702 million), made an additional billion dollars of loans to its alphabet soup of special purpose vehicles, and did another $29 billion in central bank currency swaps.

"note_en": "Companies shouldn&#39;t be afraid or embarrassed of their dev environments. It is what they use to do stuff, and what every single software person will end up using, so they should be forthcoming about it! This way, if it sucks, people can see it as a warning and stay far away.\n  Company A has you write code on your Mac laptop. Then you start up a large virtual Linux box on the laptop and it NFS-mounts your homedir from the Mac over a virtual interface. It has to download tens of GBs of packages to do this the first time, and it periodically (and unpredictably) downloads large updates. This spins up the laptop&#39;s fan. It then starts up &#34;mini me&#34; versions of other services and then starts yours. These versions are not maintained and not initialized, and must have  ...\n Most of the commands you run to do your job happen at a shell prompt on your Mac. Your experience is defined by the Mac UI and window controls.\n Company B has you write code on your Mac laptop. You then drop into a continuous build tool and type your username in four times. You click a button and about five minutes later, you are assigned a very large virtual machine running somewhere else - thousands of miles away. This machine does not share any files with your Mac. You can access the Internet from it, but you can&#39;t obtain the sources from your company&#39;s repos (&#34;git clone ...&#34;) since they are hosted with a vendor and  ...\n Most of the commands you run to do your job happen at a shell prompt on your Mac. Your experience is defined by the Mac UI and window controls.\n Company C issues you a Mac laptop and a Linux workstation. The Linux workstation is installed at your desk along with two large LCD screens on arms, a full-size keyboard and mouse. It runs a version of a popular Linux distribution which has been extended with support for the peculiarities of the corporate network and infrastructure. Your workstation primarily runs a web browser and your development environment - X terminals, editors, that sort of thing. You can talk to prod through a proxy,  ...\n Most of the commands you run to do your job happen in a shell within an X terminal on a regular Linux box which is right there at your desk. Your experience is defined by whatever window manager and/or desktop environment you want to run.\n Company D issues you a Mac laptop and a Linux development server in a data center within 1000 miles of your location. Your Mac is used for web browsing and e-mail, and you ssh to your development server. The server itself is almost the same hardware as production servers, and is physically near many of them. You run your editor and builds on that host directly. It can talk to production -- as you. It can see limited versions of prod services that you could also talk to. You can build a package  ...\n Most of the commands you run to do your job happen in a shell inside a ssh session to your development box inside a Mac terminal app on your laptop. Your experience is defined by the Mac UI and window controls.\n Company E is like company D: you get a Mac laptop and a Linux development server somewhere within 1000 miles. However, you can get away with running a Linux virtual machine on the Mac. You are allowed to teach it how to participate in the Kerberos scheme, and thus can connect directly from that VM to your development server. Everything else is the same.\n Most of the commands you run to do your job happen in a shell inside a ssh session to your development box inside an X terminal on a virtualized Linux box which is on a Mac laptop which is right there on your desk. Your experience is largely defined by whatever window manager and/or desktop environment you want to run. You can still use the Mac native side of things, like by opening the lid of the laptop or by plugging in a second display.\n Company F hands you a pile of parts resembling a computer and lets you scrounge around to find someone to burn a CD of your favorite Linux distribution. You are able to use your scissors to back out the latch to the data closet because you know there is a box of Ethernet patch cords on the floor. You put the box together, install whatever you want, plug into the network, do DHCP, start X and a browser, and are able to hit the internal company site and start learning how it works.\n Your entire job consists of doing things in the browser and sshing to other machines to do things, so every command happens in a shell in an X terminal on that Linux box right there at your desk. Your experience is completely defined by whatever you decided to load on the machine. You run whatever WM/DE you feel like running that day.\n Company G hands you a Linux laptop and puts a BIOS lock on it. It powers up and shows a terrible text-mode prompt for a password. It is a user-mode password, such that you can&#39;t get into the BIOS to change things or remove the lock. You are told that if it powers off, you will need to come back to them to have them type it in again. You are not put into group wheel or the sudoers file, so you can&#39;t change what is installed on the machine. The fact that your job (uniquely) grants  ...\n Your entire job doesn&#39;t matter. Nobody does any engineering there anyway. Attempting to build new things or change anything which already exists is met by extreme pushback from people who control their established domains with iron fists.\n I have worked at all of these companies.

"note_en": "Let&#39;s imagine a scenario in which you are dealing with JSON in your application and you want to store it in your database. You let out a heavy sigh and think, &#34;I guess I am going to have to add something besides my favorite DB (Postgres) to my  architecture. I wish I could just keep using PostgreSQL.&#34;\n You start thinking that instead of one problem, now you have many. You&#39;re probably going to have to learn a new data query syntax, data creation statement, install new software, and worst of all for you as an app developer, running some new server in production. Now rather than developing your features, you are going to be spending valuable time learning, experimenting, and praying.\n Well my friend, today is the day your wishes come true. In the blog post we will talk a little about how you can use PostgreSQL for all your JSON needs. We will also point you at some free learning  resources so you can  dig in deeper.\n  Since 9.2, released in September 2012, PostgreSQL has had a JSON type. This original JSON type was not much more than just a simple storage field that let you dump JSON into your database table. It is just a simple text field that checks to make sure your JSON is well formed. Other than that it doesn&#39;t do much and I would not recommend using it.\n With PostgreSQL release 9.4 in December 2014, a JSOB type was added. Though I joke that the B stands for better it really stands for Binary. When you put JSON data into a JSONB column, in addition to checking for well formed JSON, you now have the ability to indexing and query and retrieve portions of the document. Generally for all your work you should use JSONB unless you have a compelling reason not to. Here are a couple of nice discussions on the  tradeoffs and  choosing JSON versus  JSONB  ...\n   {\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;person&#34;:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;first_name&#34;: &#34;Steve&#34;,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;last_name&#34;: &#34;Pousty&#34;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0},\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;score&#34; : 100,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&#34;status&#34; : &#34;Awesome&#34;,\u00a0\u00a0 &#34;best_feature&#34; : &#34;humbleness&#34;}\n  Once you put it in a JSOB column named  json_content (and make a  GIN Index for faster queries) you can do all sorts of fun things. Please note that I will be using the JSONB navigation and function syntax found in PostgreSQL version 11. There was a major improvement to JSON document navigation and querying in version 12 which will be the focus of another blog post.\n    The  #&gt; or  #&gt;&gt; is the JSON path navigator with the difference being  #&gt; returns JSON and the  #&gt;&gt; returns the JSON text value.\n  Using that same document navigation syntax, we can then combine that with the containment check. Just like the name sounds, we will check to see if the stored JSON contains the JSON we are looking for. For example, if we wanted to return only those records that had a status of awesome we would write:\n    operator looks for JSON that contains the JSON on the right side of the operator.  The best part of working with JSON in PostgreSQL is that you get to leverage all the normal SQL you already love along with these JSON functions. SQL processing can be used to greatly reduce the amount of code you need in your application. For example, here is the query to get all the distinct status types in the table:\n   So if you are intrigued by what you saw here and want to learn more here are some  great resources (if I do say so myself).\n We have an  online tutorial to get your started with JSON in PostgreSQL. It is free and available 24/7 and\u00a0 I also did \u00a0a live stream walking through the material above.\n Let us know  @crunchydata what you think of the material! I would also love to hear about how YOU are using JSON with PostgreSQL.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:56:04", "tags": "postgresql,\u7528\u4e8e,json", "title":

"note_en": "In recent weeks, on a quiet stretch of Detroit\u2019s west side dotted with vacant homes, a 262,000-square-foot Coca-Cola manufacturing facility has buzzed with activity, even as many businesses in Michigan were ordered by the state to temporarily close to combat the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n Coca-Cola churns out a number of beverages here, including Dasani bottled water, which generated more than $1 billion in U.S. sales in the past year, according to market research firm IRI. It\u2019s a good time to be in the water business: As the coronavirus pandemic spread in the U.S. throughout March, bottled water sales increased 57 percent over the same time period last year.\n But among the products, such as toilet paper and\u00a0 hand sanitizer, that Americans are panic-buying, bottled water is unusual: There is no shortage of safe drinking water, and health officials have tried to assure people that public water supplies are not contaminated by the coronavirus. Hoarding bottled water simply isn\u2019t necessary for most people.\n  What\u2019s more, most bottled water sold in the U.S. comes from the same municipal sources that supply tap water\u2014a fact that might be unknown to most consumers. Coca-Cola makes Dasani at the company\u2019s Detroit plant by purchasing, treating, and bottling municipal water before selling it at a significant upcharge to consumers. Pepsi bottles its Aquafina water brand in Detroit the same way.\n The business model is hugely profitable. The cost to buy that municipal water is exceedingly low\u2014and once bottled, the markup can be around 133 times greater, a Consumer Reports analysis of company water billing and usage records found.\n But what\u2019s good for businesses isn\u2019t necessarily good for consumers, according to CR\u2019s review, which included the examination of hundreds of pages of billing and other records obtained through public records requests, and interviews with environmental law experts, industry consultants, residents of Detroit, and consumer advocates.\n For starters, bottlers and consumers aren\u2019t always treated as equals by water utilities, CR found. In Detroit, whose policy prior to the coronavirus crisis called for shutting off water to residents if they fell $150 behind in their water bills, 2,800 homes were estimated to be without running water at the start of the pandemic. (Read more about  cities that have not restored water to residents during the coronavirus crisis.)\n But bottlers in Detroit have also racked up tens of thousands of dollars of past-due water bills that went unpaid for months, CR found. Not once has their access to water been shut off over the time period we examined. When asked why, the city cited the companies\u2019 strong payment history and an ability to pay their bills.\u00a0The city said in a later statement that it had made errors collecting past-due balances.\n  From a regulatory point of view, companies that want to put vast quantities of public water into bottles for profit face few hurdles and minimal ancillary costs, leading some experts to call for taxes on the bottlers. And because the water supply, including the processing and infrastructure, that bottlers rely on is paid for by local taxpayers, the companies\u2019 business is subsidized by the public, consumer advocates say.\n \u201cThese bottlers are essentially double-dipping\u2014receiving low-cost water subsidized by taxpayers and then turning around and selling it back to the public at a significant markup,\u201d says Brian Ronholm, CR\u2019s director of food policy.\n  Detroit has been questioned about the potential health risk of water shutoffs before. In August 2014, residents who had their taps turned off argued in court to suspend shutoffs because a lack of water could create unsanitary conditions and lead to the transmission of hepatitis A, influenza, and other diseases.\n Detroit\u2019s lawyers argued that those residents could rely on alternative sources\u2014like bottled water. \u201cJust because a person is out of water doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t get water,\u201d a city lawyer said at a court hearing.\n The judge in the case ultimately sided with the city, and the shutoff campaign carried on.\n Now, six years later, Detroit and other cities have taken some steps to address residential water shutoffs during the coronavirus crisis\u2014people need running water not just to cook and bathe but also to practice basic virus-fighting hygiene.\n  A Detroit spokesperson says all customers who called to enroll in a program that would turn their water back on during the pandemic have either been restored or are in the process of a restoration. But the spokesperson concedes that some occupants might not have called, and advocates dispute the city\u2019s reported progress.\n \u201cWe believe the city of Detroit is vastly exaggerating their progress and underreporting the number of people without water,\u201d Shea Howell\u2014a member of the People\u2019s Water Board, an advocacy group based in Detroit\u2014said during a recent teleconference with reporters.\n The coronavirus pandemic has underscored just how problematic water shutoffs can be, as utilities servicing nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population still have not committed to suspending water shutoffs, according to  Food &amp; Water Watch. This has consumer advocates worried.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just unconscionable to make people fear losing their water service at this time,\u201d says Mary Grant, director of the Public Water for All campaign at Food &amp; Water Watch. \u201cWe need every governor to step up to address this crisis immediately.\u201d\n It\u2019s a striking situation. People whose water gets shut off because they can\u2019t afford their bill may have no choice but to buy bottled water that comes from the same source that feeds their tap. They may be obtaining bottled water from companies that have been behind on their water bills but didn\u2019t face a shutoff, and whose business depends on access to publicly funded water systems.\n And it\u2019s not just in Detroit: Coca-Cola and Pepsi get water from other major cities, including Phoenix and Denver, with a history of shutting off water to residents before the coronavirus crisis.\n Coca-Cola didn\u2019t respond to questions from CR about water shutoffs or its late payments, but the company says that it obtains water from a variety of sources, including municipal supplies, and uses a treatment process that \u201ccreates a consistent pure, clean, and crisp taste.\u201d The company remains in operation, the company says, because the federal government identified the food and beverage industry as \u201ccritical\u201d to keeping grocery stores stocked.\n  Beulah Walker, chief coordinator for the nonprofit group Hydrate Detroit, which assists residents without running water, pointed out the irony of the situation for residents who have lost their water service at home and may turn to bottled water\u2014possibly Aquafina or Dasani made with city tap water\u2014as an alternative.\n  Two decades ago, most bottled water in the U.S. came from natural springs, sold by brands such as Evian and Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Poland Spring. But bottlers soon came to see the benefit of tap water as a source, says Erik Olson, senior strategic director of health and food at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC): It\u2019s cheaper. \u201cAnd the more water you use, often, the less you pay per gallon,\u201d he says.\n After Coca-Cola and Pepsi introduced their bottled water brands in the 1990s, the industry began to shift from spring water to \u201cpurified,\u201d which generally means municipal water that is treated further, sometimes through a process called reverse osmosis. In 2000, spring water made up 67 percent of the bottled water market and the rest was purified water. By 2018, those numbers had essentially flipped, industry data show, with purified water now dominating the market.\n The International Bottled Water Association, an industry group, asserts that bottled water provides consumers with a value-added product. \u201cPurified bottled water is not just tap water in a bottle,\u201d says Jill Culora, an IBWA spokesperson. (Coca-Cola and Pepsi aren\u2019t members of the IBWA.)\n \u201cThe chemical and physical quality of this bottled water product is not the same as the water that comes out of the tap,\u201d she says.\n See how much the average American consumes of the nation&#39;s most popular non-alcoholic bottled beverages each year.\n But bottlers have caught some flack for failing to correct consumers\u2019 misimpression that all bottled water came from natural spring sources. In 2007, for example, following criticism, Pepsi agreed to state on Aquafina labels that the water was sourced from a municipal supply. \u201cIf this helps clarify the fact that the water originates from public sources, then it\u2019s a reasonable thing to do,\u201d the company said at the time.\n Aquafina and Dasani continue to rack up dramatic sales for Pepsi and Coca-Cola, respectively. Last year, industry data show, each company cleared $1 billion in U.S. sales of their bottled tap water brands.\n Companies turning tap water into bottled water can thank the Food and Drug Administration and state regulators, which together oversee the nation\u2019s bottled water, for making the regulatory approval process a relative snap.\n For instance, in Michigan Coca-Cola and Pepsi had to provide documentation showing that the Detroit Water &amp; Sewerage Department (DWSD) certified that its tap supply source is safe for consumption. They also had to confirm that their facilities were connected to the Detroit system before paying $25 for a permit to sell a product in the state.\n By contrast, when a company wants to launch a spring water brand, they have to undergo a far more complicated and costly process. That includes finding a groundwater source and building the machinery to pump the water up and the infrastructure to transport it to a processing facility\u2014as well as surmounting regulatory hurdles to get the water tested for safety and approved. (Culora says the IBWA couldn\u2019t comment on production cost differences between spring and municipal water.)\n  And while it \u2019s true that the vast majority of bottlers \u2014if not all \u2014using a public water supply will clean it further, they don \u2019t necessarily have to. If a company bottles tap water but does not treat it, it \u2019s required to explicitly note on the label that its product comes from a municipal or community source and the product cannot be labeled \u201cpurified. \u201d(Water that is treated further is not required to be labeled as being from a municipal source, but some products, including Aquafina,  ...\n It\u2019s unclear how many brands produce water this way; the IBWA says it\u2019s not aware of any bottled water products that use a municipal source and aren\u2019t purified, asserting that the possibility any such brand exists is \u201cextremely unlikely.\u201d\n But the IBWA doesn\u2019t represent all bottlers, and in fact, some cities even toyed with the idea of bottling their tap water in the 1990s.\n In 2014, Detroit\u2019s shutoff policy drew national attention when the city, which emerged that year from bankruptcy, launched a campaign to disconnect service to residents in arrears\u2014forcing some people to turn to other sources, such as capturing rainwater or buying bottled water. Shutoffs have continued since then, but officials concluded in early March that a reprieve was needed to try to help residents during the coronavirus outbreak.\n  Ricky Reynolds is one of the beneficiaries. The 65-year-old Detroit resident moved into his home down the road from Coca-Cola\u2019s bottling plant last summer after obtaining the deed from an acquaintance for $500. It should have been a happy occasion. Reynolds had been homeless, bouncing between family and friends, so it was a relief to get his own place\u2014until he tried to get the water bill put in his name.\n Reynolds, who is retired, learned from the city that his new home had a nearly $20,000 unpaid water bill.\n \u201cIt\u2019s hard to catch up with $20,000 when you have a fixed income,\u201d he says. And the city refused to turn on his water unless he paid 10 percent of the bill, he says, a monumental demand for someone living on Social Security income. Reynolds was never able to pay the bill.\n In the months before the city finally restored his water service during the pandemic, Reynolds says, he had to fill up containers with water from family members, then haul them home. And he bought bottled water whenever he could\u2014including, he says, Dasani, which may have been made around the corner at the Coca-Cola plant. (The city didn\u2019t directly respond to questions about Reynolds\u2019 case.)\n Detroit\u2019s temporarily suspended shutoff policy states that residents or businesses are delinquent and potentially risk having their water shut off if they are 60 days past due with a minimum balance of $150, a spokesperson says. (The city considers a company\u2019s accounting practices, as well, before determining whether to proceed with a service interruption.)\n  Between April and July 2017, billing records show, Coca-Cola had a $77,600 balance that went unpaid for three months. From August to November of that year, it carried a balance of as much as $287,250 before paying it off. From December 2017 to March 2018, the company had a balance that fluctuated between $1,860 to $108,170 before paying it off in full. Meanwhile, from December 2018 to February 2019, Pepsi had a balance between $1,410 and $29,710 until paying it off.\n  \u201cSince both Pepsi and Coca-Cola have a strong payment history and an unmatched ability to pay their bills, DWSD does not pursue service interruptions,\u201d says Bryan Peckinpaugh, a DWSD spokesperson. \u201cThese companies never go longer than three months past due, at which time the balances due, including late fees, are paid. These companies are not a priority target for service interruption due to their payment history and ability to pay.\u201d\n (After CR published this article, the DWSD said that, contrary to Peckinpaugh\u2019s previous statement, the past-due balances cited on the billing data were due to errors on the city&#39;s part, including address mailing issues. Regardless, while the city registered Pepsi and Coca-Cola as delinquent, and continued sending bills and assessing late fees, it never shut off the companies\u2019 water.)\n Coca-Cola and Pepsi didn\u2019t respond to CR\u2019s questions about why they went months without paying their bills.\n  \u201cYou should have a policy and should apply it equitably,\u201d she says. \u201cI think this is discrimination against low-income households in Detroit, that you\u2019re having a shutoff policy and you\u2019re not applying it, the same shutoff policy, to these big corporations because you expect them to pay down the road.\u201d\n Reynolds was also stunned to hear that Detroit let Coca-Cola and Pepsi\u2019s bills slide.\n \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re picking on the little guy.\u201d\n For bottlers, a single municipal source can generate significant revenue, according to records CR obtained.\n Pepsi\u2019s average output of Aquafina at a Pennsylvania manufacturing plant is approximately 9.36 million cases per year, according to a January 2018 inspection report. At an industry wholesale average of $1.33 per gallon, that means Pepsi could gross $19.73 million to $23.36 million annually from Aquafina produced at just that one plant, according to an analysis by CR.\n By contrast, billing records obtained by CR show that Pepsi paid $467,941 for water in 2017 to Harrisburg\u2019s water utility operator for 51.21 million gallons\u2014or about one penny per gallon. Pepsi has at least 12 bottling facilities that make Aquafina in the U.S. Coca-Cola has more than 30 that make Dasani.\n In Detroit, Pepsi\u2019s plant can push out on average between \u201c500,000 and 600,000 cases of product each day\u201d at its plant just outside of Detroit\u2019s Eastern Market district, according to a 2017 inspection report. (That number counts not just Aquafina but also all Pepsi beverages made at the plant, including soda and bottled tea.)\n Coca-Cola has a seemingly good deal in Detroit, too. The company paid the city about $1 million for water and associated fees in 2018, records show, which is less than 0.3 percent of all revenue the DWSD generated in fiscal 2018. That same year, Coca-Cola received 106.13 million gallons of water.\n A spokesperson for Coca-Cola told CR that it financially supports Detroit and other cities in which it operates by paying commercial rates for the water it uses. But, at least in Detroit, the rate the city charges bottlers and city residents is the same.\n \u201cPepsiCo and Coca-Cola are charged the same water, sewerage, and drainage rates as any customer in Detroit,\u201d says Peckinpaugh at the DWSD.\n  Environmentalists and consumer advocates say that, as a result, bottled water companies are effectively being subsidized by taxpayers.\n \u201cThe public paid for the water treatment plant to be built, the public paid for the intake structure, the public paid for decades of laying pipes down, the distribution system, the maintenance of that\u2014all those costs are sunk costs,\u201d says the NRDC\u2019s Olson. He adds that the companies also don\u2019t have to contribute to ongoing maintenance costs, essentially giving them a \u201cfree ride.\u201d\n The IBWA disputes that characterization. Culora, the spokesperson, says that bottled water companies pay utilities for the water they use and that, in doing so, they help \u201cthe city generate additional revenue without needing to increase the rates that consumers pay for their tap water.\u201d\n But Jim Olson, an environmental and water rights lawyer who works with For Love of Water, a nonprofit based in Michigan, agrees with Erik Olson (who\u2019s unrelated) that the system as it is gives bottlers a financial break. His group drafted a model law that would, among other things, charge bottling companies a royalty or fee on the sale of water, with the proceeds going to a state fund.\n \u201cWhat we have is an ongoing, very lucrative subsidy for the bottled water industry by ratepayers,\u201d Jim Olson says.\n Others are offering different ways to raise funds from bottlers that can be put toward the cost of maintaining water system infrastructure or providing financial aid to residents behind on their water bill. One idea is for bottlers to pay a tax on their product, or for municipalities to assess one at the point of sale.\n Nick Schroeck, an environmental law expert and associate dean of experiential education at the University of Detroit Mercy, writing in 2018 for The Conversation, an academic news site, focused on  a long-running environmental controversyin northern Michigan involving Nestl\u00e9, which pays a $200 annual permitting fee to suck up millions of gallons of spring water in the state. Public outrage had been \u201csimmering \u201dover how little Nestl\u00e9 pays for access to a public resource vs. how much  ...\n At the time, Michigan lawmakers were considering a tax of 5 cents per gallon on water harvested from groundwater by bottlers, who would pay the tax, with the intention of generating revenue for a dedicated fund for water infrastructure costs. But the bill died in the legislature.\n Schroeck tells CR he believes there\u2019s still potential in this idea. He suggests a tax for bottlers could be used to help low-income residents struggling to pay their water bills. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s a legitimate public health safety purpose for it, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem,\u201d he says.\n  The IBWA\u2019s Culora says her group opposes any effort to tax bottled water. She points to a recent report by the California State Water Resources Control Board that examined the possibility of using a bottled water tax at the point of sale to fund a financial aid program for low-income residents. The tax  could raise $153.6 millionfor such a fund, according to a draft of the report, though, it says, the tax \u201ccould have a regressive impact on low-income households that purchase bottled  ...\n But the board adds in the report that most bottled water expenditures are discretionary, and there\u2019s a \u201cpossible basis\u201d for taxing it to fund such a program because it contributes to \u201cpublic trash and other environmental impacts.\u201d (A final version of the report is not complete. Coca-Cola didn\u2019t respond directly to questions by CR about a tax.)\n Since 2016, nearly 16,000 households in Detroit have enrolled in a local financial aid program, according to the city \u2019s water department. But Nick Leonard, executive director of the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit based in Detroit, says that additional measures are needed to help residents unable to pay. They would ultimately benefit utilities, he adds, by generating more revenue for the utility because more residents would be able to keep up with their bills.  ...\n Consumer Reports agrees there\u2019s viability in taxing bottled water to fund a financial aid program. \u201cA tax on bottlers could be viewed by states and municipalities as a way to help offset that arrangement and allow them to apply needed funds toward assisting low-income residents with their water bills and/or improving their water system infrastructure,\u201d says Ronholm, CR\u2019s director of food policy.\n If you\u2019re concerned about the quality of your tap water and are on a public system, you should be able to get a report from your local water authority about the level of contaminants that may be present, if you\u2019re serviced by a community water system. The Environmental Protection Agency and World Health Organization say that the novel coronavirus has not been detected in municipal supplies, and risk of it happening is low.\n \u201cMost water in the U.S. is safe, and if you\u2019re hoarding bottled water, you\u2019re taking it away from people who might not have safe water at home, people who\u2019ve been shut off,\u201d says Grant at Food &amp; Water Watch.\n Water filters are an option for those who want to exercise added caution, as well. In the past, CR has reviewed filters for their ability to remove certain potentially dangerous contaminants.\n Consumer advocates and activists say that while the move to suspend shutoffs is encouraging, a long-term solution is necessary. That was a theme echoed by public health experts and advocates at a teleconference earlier this month on the move to ban shutoffs in Detroit during the pandemic, including Monica Lewis-Patrick, president of We the People of Detroit, a human rights and water advocacy group.\n \u201cEven after the coronavirus pandemic has passed, we must work together to develop an affordable water structure that will allow those who\u2019ve been restored to maintain their water and access to proper sanitation,\u201d Lewis-Patrick says.\n Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0This article was updated to include a

"note_en": "For years, researchers have been attempting to build AI systems that can converse as well and naturally as humans. So far however, these efforts have only been successful in narrow, specialized and pre-programmed tasks.\n Three months ago Google released Meena, a neural-network-powered chatbot. Meena significantly outperformed other chatbots on Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA), an evaluation metric based on key elements of humanlike, multi-turn conversation.\n  \u201cThis is the first chatbot to blend a diverse set of conversational skills \u2014 including empathy, knowledge, and personality \u2014 together in one system,\u201d Facebook researchers boasted in a blog post.\n The researchers pitted Blender against Meena, determining \u201cin human evaluations of engagingness our best model outperforms Meena in a pairwise comparison 75 percent to 25 percent, and in terms of humanness by 65 percent to 35 percent.\u201d\n In an associated paper, the researchers summarize their approach for building such open-domain chatbots \u2014 including scale, blending skills, and generation strategies. \u201cWe achieved this milestone through a new chatbot recipe that includes improved decoding techniques, novel blending of skills, and a model with 9.4 billion parameters, which is 3.6x more than the largest existing system.\u201d\n The first step in Blender\u2019s creation was large-scale training. The team pretrained large Transformer neural networks on large amounts of conversational data and used previously available public domain conversations that involved 1.5 billion training examples of extracted conversations.\n They also introduced a novel Blended Skill Talk (BST) for training and evaluating desirable skills for Blender. Based on their previous research, the premise was that an ideal chatbot needs to be knowledgeable, have a personality, and be able to show empathy. Blending these skills however can be difficult because systems must be able to switch between different tasks when appropriate. The BST dataset provides a way to build systems that automatically and appropriately blend and exhibit these  ...\n Generation strategies such as beam search, next token sampling, and n-gram blocking are typically used after model training to ensure conversational agents don\u2019t repeat themselves or drop random words out of context. The researchers analyzed these generation strategies, determining for example that the length of an agent\u2019s utterances is particularly important in achieving better results with human evaluators.\n The researchers also noted that contrary to some recent research suggesting beam search is inferior to sampling, the choice of search hyperparameters can improve results by controlling trade-offs. \u201cIn particular, constraining the minimum beam length gives a crucial control of the dull versus spicy spectrum of responses.\u201d\n Despite the impressive performance achievements, the researchers stress much work remains in solving open-domain conversation. They are currently exploring ways to improve the models\u2019 conversational quality in longer conversations with new architectures and different loss functions.\n To encourage and assist in global conversational AI research, the team decided to release the complete model, code, and evaluation set-up to enable other AI researchers to reproduce, explore, and build on the work.\n The paper  Recipes for Building an Open-domain Chatbot is on  arXiv, and the code can be found  here.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:55:53", "tags": "facebook,\u673a\u5668\u4eba,blender,\u5bf9\u8bdd,researchers", "title": "Facebook\u79f0\u5176\u201c\u6405\u62cc\u673a\u201d\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u662f\u6709\u53f2\u4ee5\u6765\u6700\u4eba\u6027\u5316\u7684", "title_en": "Facebook Says Its \u2018Blender\u2019 Chatbot Is the Most Humanlike Ever", "transed": 0, "url": "https://medium.com/syncedreview/facebook-says-its-blender-chatbot-is-the-most-humanlike-ever-6b939d7de8df", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["facebook", "\u673a\u5668\u4eba", "blender", "\u5bf9\u8bdd"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "636ed93a2db31cbf282a4e3c2f853efa.jpg", "infoid": 1000169, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u603b\u7edf\u7279\u6717\u666e\u63d0\u51fa\u76842021\u5e74\u9884\u7b97\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8be5\u56fd\u706b\u661f\u63a2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5384\u8fd0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u8f86\u706b\u661f\u6f2b\u6e38\u8f66\u3002\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4f4d\u4e00\u518d\u6566\u4fc3\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u5c40(NASA)\u5411\u706b\u661f\u6d3e\u9063\u8f7d\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u603b\u7edf\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684\u4e3e\u52a8-\u751a\u81f3\u5411\u822a\u5929\u5c40\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u6765\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u636e\u201c\u79d1\u5b66\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u201d\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u62df\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u524a\u51cf\u5c06\u524a\u5f31\u51e0\u4e2a\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5173\u95ed\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u7684\u597d\u5947\u53f7\u6708\u7403\u8f66\uff0c\u8be5\u6708\u7403\u8f66\u81ea2012\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u706b\u661f\u3002\n\u8bb8\u591a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5bf9\u9884\u7b97\u8868\u793a\u5931\u671b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cNASA\u884c\u661f\u79d1\u5b66\u90e8\u4e3b\u4efbLori Glaze\u6301\u52a1\u5b9e\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\n\u201c\u53bb\u5e74\u9700\u8981\u505a\u51fa\u8bb8\u591a\u8270\u96be\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1a\u6295\u8d44\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u505a\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5728\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u67d0\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u201dGlaze\u544a\u8bc9SCIAM\u3002\u201c\u6240\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u90fd\u4f1a\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\u706b\u661f\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u201c\u3002\n\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u5bb6\u5219\u6301\u66f4\u4e3a\u6124\u4e16\u5ac9\u4fd7\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u3002\u4e54\u6cbb\u534e\u76db\u987f\u5927\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u5386\u53f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u517c\u653f\u7b56\u7814\u7a76\u5458\u7ea6\u7ff0\u00b7\u6d1b\u683c\u65af\u987f\u544a\u8bc9SECAM\uff0c\u524a\u51cf\u9884\u7b97\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u60e9\u7f5aNASA\u5728\u5176\u6bc5\u529b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u51fa\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u5c06\u8bd5\u56fe\u57282021\u5e74\u5728\u706b\u661f\u4e0a\u7740\u9646\u4e00\u8f86\u65b0\u7684\u6708\u7403\u8f66\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u571f\u58e4\u6837\u672c\u9001\u56de\u5730\u7403\u3002\nLogsdon\u544a\u8bc9SIPAM\uff1a\u201c\u5982\u679c\u8fd9\u79cd\u60e9\u7f5a\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u63a8\u8fdb\u706b\u661f\u6837\u672c\u8fd4\u56de\u52aa\u529b\u7684\u589e\u957f\u52bf\u5934\uff0c\u90a3\u5c06\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u77ed\u89c6\u7684\u3002\u201d\u201c\u5fc5\u987b\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9NASA\u79d1\u5b66\u52aa\u529b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5371\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7406\u7531\u3002\u201d", "note_en": "U.S. President Trump\u2019s proposed 2021 budget could spell doom for the country\u2019s Mars exploration missions, including its last Mars rover.\n It\u2019s an unusual move for a President who has  repeatedly urged NASA to send a crewed mission to Mars \u2014 and even offered the space agency  unlimited funding to do so.\n But the proposed budget cuts would debilitate several ongoing missions,   Scientific American  reports, and would even mean shutting down the iconic rover Curiosity, which has been exploring Mars since 2012.\n    Many scientists responded to the budget with dismay.

the Vision Fund, as the virus compounds woes at one of the firm\u2019s biggest bets.\n  The hit extends the group\u2019s expected net loss to 900 billion yen as investments made via the $100 billion fund sour, with the latest writedown illustrating how the group is racing to keep pace with the deteriorating value of its portfolio.\n \u201cEvery writedown takes Wework\u2019s carrying value closer to reality. Clearly the value is zero,\u201d said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Holdings.\n SoftBank is embroiled in a legal dispute with directors at WeWork after backing out of a $3 billion tender offer agreed when it bailed out the office-sharing firm following a flopped IPO attempt last year.\n The tech conglomerate has poured more than $13.5 billion into WeWork, one of a string of troubled bets by CEO Masayoshi Son that have laid waste to SoftBank\u2019s full-year earnings.\n The group maintained its forecast of a record annual operating loss of 1.35 trillion yen announced earlier this month.\n The darkening future for WeWork with customers in lockdown comes as deep-seated problems from SoftBank\u2019s cash-fuelled push for rapid expansion are being compounded by the coronavirus outbeak.\n SoftBank shares pared gains to close up 0.5% compared to a 2.1% rise in the benchmark index .N255. The group has launched a record 2.5 trillion yen buyback to support its share price. CEO Son uses his SoftBank shares as collateral for loans.\n The highly leveraged conglomerate has been forced into selling major assets to raise funds, but could receive a big boost from the Bank of Japan\u2019s plan to expand corporate bond buying, which would support its predilection for borrowing.\n SoftBank was sitting on around $160 billion of interest-bearing debt at the end of December and has seen yields on its bonds rise as high as 4.5% this month.\n Portfolio companies are continuing to retreat from a SoftBank-cash fuelled push for breakneck growth, with Indian hotel chain Oyo

"note_en": "April 2020  For 200 years, coal has powered the modern world. It was the prime fuel for the industrial revolution and along with hydropower, coal-burning technology  gave the world its first electric power plants. It has been essential in making steel, one of the main materials with which our modern world is literally built. It\u2019s hard to imagine the development of industrial civilization without coal.\n But it\u2019s dirty. Burning coal  releases nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and even mercury and lead into the air. It also produces giant piles of toxic ash, which can pollute waterways. And perhaps most significant of all, at the point of combustion coal is  one of the most carbon-intensive sources of electricity generation. When you factor in  coal mine methane releases, the life-cycle emissions of coal make it likely the worst fossil fuel for the climate.\n Because of this, a central goal of climate campaigners has been to reduce coal use and shutter coal-fired power plants, and most serious climate plans involve entirely phasing out coal in electricity generation as soon as feasible.\n But emissions are not the only problem with coal. The fuel is simply no longer the leader in low-cost power that it once was. In nations with shale gas deposits such as the United States, natural gas-fired generation is cheaper. And across the world, the continuously falling cost of solar and wind have made them less expensive forms of electricity than coal.\n With coal plants increasingly unable to compete in wholesale power markets, the number of hours that they run has fallen, meaning less revenue for plant owners. This has led to waves of coal plant closures over the last two decades in the United States and Europe. And with a global decline in demand for electricity due to economic restrictions imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, coal has been under even more pressure; a report released by the International Energy Agency  ...\n And yet despite this dismal economic picture, coal plants are still being built in large numbers, and the size of the global coal fleet continues to grow. According to an analysis by Carbon Tracker, 500 gigawatts of new coal-fired power plants\u2014roughly half the capacity of the entire US electric fleet\u2014are either under construction or planned across the world.\n    The crisis in the profitability of coal-fired power plants is not new. And it doesn\u2019t come from coal itself, or the technology used to turn the heat from burning coal into electricity. Instead, the challenge for coal is that other technologies have improved and become less expensive.\n Combined cycle gas technology, which uses a second turbine to capture the waste heat from the first turbine, has shown particular improvement. GE boasts  62 percent efficiency with its combined cycle gas plants using its H-Class turbines, while the efficiency of even the most advanced ultra-supercritical coal technology is  still below 50 percent.\n But the biggest advantage that gas has had is the development of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies. These have allowed gas producers to access previously unavailable gas deposits in shale leading to  a superabundant supply. This has meant sustained low prices in nations with shale gas deposits but has also freed up surplus gas for global liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets.\n This effect has been particularly profound in the United States. Coal had been the largest source of electricity generation for more than a century when gas eclipsed coal in 2015. Gas generated 38 percent of all  US electricity in 2019, compared to only 24 percent from coal.\n But the greatest long-term threat to coal comes from solar and wind, which have seen dramatic cost declines over the past two decades. For the second half of 2009, BloombergNEF\u2019s (BNEF) estimate for the global average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from onshore wind was US$111 per megawatt-hour (MWh), with offshore wind even higher at $190/MWh. For the first half of 2020 BNEF put these figures at $44 and $78/MWh, meaning that costs fell by more than half.\n The cost decline for solar photovoltaics (PV) was even more dramatic. Here costs fell from $347\u2013$362/MWh in the second half of 2009 (for fixed-tilt and tracking systems) to $39\u2013$50/MWh in the first half of 2020, which translates to costs being less than one-seventh what they were in 2009.\n Consultancy Lazard has  released similar figures, showing similar dramatic cost declines for solar and wind over the last decade. But while the costs of solar, wind, and gas have fallen, coal has stayed relatively steady.\n And in competitive wholesale power markets, solar and wind eat coal\u2019s lunch. With no fuel costs and only the long-term costs of building the plant and minimal operations and maintenance, there is no reason not to sell power from wind and solar plants, even when the price falls to zero. This is not the case for coal or gas-fired power plants, which must pay for fuel, and this has been particularly damning for coal during the current downturn in demand.\n    In March, London-based Carbon Tracker issued a new report,   How to Waste over Half a Trillion Dollars, which showed that it is cheaper to build solar and wind than new coal plants in every major geography. Even more significantly, it found that in some cases it was cheaper to build new wind or solar than to even keep running existing coal-fired power plants. And by 2030, the think tank found that this would be the case everywhere.\n These are radical findings, even for Carbon Tracker, which found that coal was much less competitive than was indicated by the  research it had published only sixteen months prior. Lazard has issued similar findings; its latest LCOE estimates put the global, unsubsidized cost of coal-fired power plants at US$66\u2013$152/MWh, roughly double that of combined-cycle gas plants, more than double the cost of wind, and nearly triple the cost of utility-scale solar.\n And this is not theory. Global coal demand peaked in 2013 and has been falling since. The subsequent fall in prices has hit the highest-cost producers the hardest, with devastating impacts on the US and Polish coal sectors. In the United States, the blow has been particularly hard, with both a massive reduction in domestic demand and low prices for export. As a result, the US coal industry has seen wave after wave of bankruptcies.\n As the COVID-19 pandemic reduces both industrial and electric demand, coal is under even more pressure. Because buying the coal as fuel makes up much of the cost of coal-fired power, coal plants are some of the first to turn off when power demand falls. The US Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Agency is predicting a 20 percent fall in electricity generation from coal this year, while coal prices plunge even further.\n    And despite all of these economic cases against coal, more coal-fired capacity is put online every year than is retired, with the result that there is a greater capacity in coal-fired power plants this year than at any time in history. But this fact conceals profound regional differences.\n Coal plants are increasingly going offline in Europe and not being replaced at the same rate. In the United States, no coal plants have been built for several years. Additionally, several nations have set phase-out dates for coal. Coal-fired power has disappeared or nearly disappeared in some nations and regions, including Austria and Sweden; in both nations  the last coal-fired power plant shut off in April.\n In Asia, it is a different story. India, Turkey, multiple nations in Southeast Asia, and especially China are building dozens of gigawatts of new coal plants, and this has more than made up for the retirements in Europe and North America.\n    It is not an accident that most coal plants are being built in the developing world. In more affluent nations, electricity demand is flat or declining. But in the developing world there is a need for more electricity to power growing economies: more people and more wealth. \u201cWhen you are a country that is looking for steep economic growth and you already have an infrastructure that is built around fossil fuels, it might seem easier to do it that way, \u201dexplains  ...\n And in nations without domestic gas reserves, imported LNG is unlikely to be able to compete with coal\u2014even if those nations have the infrastructure to import LNG. Furthermore, in many nations there are incentives for coal-fired power plants, which distort the raw economics.\n Indonesia has the third-largest fleet of coal-fired power plants currently under construction, which Global Energy Monitor puts at just under 12 GW. Lauri Myllyvirta, the lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CRECA) notes that it is also one of the nations that most heavily subsidizes electricity generation from coal. Not only are coal producers required to sell a portion of the coal they mine at a discount to domestic power plants,  ...\n However, Indonesia is not unique, and Myllyvirta notes that similar dynamics play out in Turkey, India, China and other developing nations that mine coal. \u201cIf you look at the countries that still have coal-fired power pipelines, it is by and large countries with a domestic coal mining industry,\u201d explains Myllyvirta. \u201cIt is about creating demand for that domestic industry.\u201d\n    As far as the energy transition goes, China represents a paradox. The nation has grown the amount of renewable energy that it puts online every year much faster than its Western counterparts,  growing wind and solar generation 12-fold over the last decade.\n However, the nation\u2019s ever-growing appetite for more electricity to power its expanding economy means that China\u2019s raw consumption of coal has been on a growth path over the last decade. This is happening even as renewable energy takes up a larger portion of its power mix, and as the share of coal in primary energy consumption has fallen from 74 percent in 2013 to 58 percent in 2019.\n According to the analysis by Carbon Tracker, China has the largest capacity of coal-fired generation under construction of any nation on earth, at nearly 100 gigawatts. The think tank identified another 106 GW of plants that are being planned after that, which translates to roughly 40 percent of the total underway globally.\n And yet Carbon Tracker\u2019s analysis shows that on a long-term basis of power delivered, new wind and solar are cheaper sources of power than new coal. BNEF agrees, and its latest LCOE estimates show solar as the cheapest form of new electricity in China at US$38/MWh; although this figure conceals significant regional differences in cost.\n So why is China building all of these coal plants? There are several factors. First, unlike petroleum or gas, coal is domestically produced. That means that coal is not only seen as a means to energy security and less dependence on imports, but as the world\u2019s largest coal producer there are millions of Chinese workers employed in the coal sector, from mining to running power plants.\n \u201cCoal has been seen as the only self-sufficient industry here in China,\u201d explains Xiang Li, the manager of RMI China\u2019s power initiative. \u201cEverything here in the power sector was constructed with coal as the cornerstone.\u201d\n Policy decisions have a role as well. While China has passed a number of policies to prioritize renewable energy, some also have benefitted coal. In 2014, authority for permitting was transferred from the central government to the provincial level, and over the next two years local governments permitted dozens of gigawatts of coal-fired power plants.\n In 2016, China\u2019s central government began  issuing a series of restrictions on coal-fired power plants. However, many of the coal plants which were permitted or proposed during the 2014\u20132016 period are being built today.\n These new projects are coming into a power market where there is significant overcapacity, with utilization rates for the nation\u2019s coal fleet  falling to only 50 percent. However, the provincial governments approving these plants have even stronger economic reasons to do so than they do to build solar factories. \u201cEvery province has an incentive to improve its GDP,\u201d notes RMI\u2019s Li. \u201cThey are fully aware of the overcapacity situation.\u201d\n The raw numbers here also conceal a geographic shift. Li notes that in recent years the more affluent, urbanized provinces have been tightening air control rules, leading to the shutdown of coal-fired power plants near large cities. Meanwhile, the central government is prioritizing coal-fired power plants in the more rural provinces of Western China, near where the coal is mined.\n China is engaged in not only expanding its domestic coal fleet, but also funding overseas projects. Even as many Western banks have stopped financing coal-fired power plants, Chinese banks are currently  financing nearly 40 GW of coal projects, many of which are in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Africa. This is led by state-run banks, with the Export-Import Bank of China, the China Development Bank, and the Bank of China as the three largest  ...\n Japanese banks are also  funding nearly 20 GW of coal-fired power plants. In both cases the motivation for doing so may be in part to support domestic industries; CRECA\u2019s Myllyvirta notes that China exports both coal and machinery while Japanese companies often make the power plants themselves.\n    Every investment in a power plant is a bet on future power prices. However, Carbon Tracker says that in many cases, the institutions investing in coal-fired power are looking at short-term profitability. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of not thinking long term,\u201d states Carbon Tracker\u2019s Sundaresan. \u201c10 years can seem a long time away, if you are looking at an investment that might bring in returns in the short term.\u201d\n There is also some debate about the economics. While Carbon Tracker, BNEF and Lazard put the cost of new wind and solar below that of coal-fired power in most or all of the world, the IEA\u2019s World Energy Outlook put the LCOE of coal-fired power at only $50 per megawatt-hour in China in 2018, below the cost of either solar or wind (each at $60/MWh).\n IEA\u2019s assumptions for its LCOE are different than those used by BNEF, Carbon Tracker or Lazard, and these appear to be consistently more favorable to coal. As one example, IEA estimates a 70 percent capacity factor for new Chinese coal plants, which is far above the current fleet-wide utilization rate.\n Additionally, IEA\u2019s cost estimates for new wind and solar plants are much higher than those produced by BNEF or Lazard. However, given the global clout of IEA these LCOE figures may be leading institutions and other investors to see a future for coal-fired power.\n It may be one that does not materialize. While there is more capacity in power plants to burn coal for electricity than there ever was, we aren \u2019t burning as much coal in those plants. Even with demand rising in the developing world, global coal use peaked in 2013 and has been essentially flat since then. And with these two trends, the number of hours that coal-fired power plants are used has fallen not only in China, but also globally.  ...\n    Carbon Tracker has warned that despite mechanisms to protect the investments of state-owned banks, China is still at risk of stranded assets. \u201cChina is prioritizing growth targets, energy security and coal-related jobs over project viability, \u201dnotes Carbon Tracker \u2019s Sundaresan. She warns that lowering risk ratings for coal-powered capacity could be dangerous. \u201cMore capacity will be constructed, creating potential overcapacity and  ...\n Carbon Tracker is warning of an \u201cextreme\u201d risk of stranded coal assets not only in China, but also in India, the European Union, and the United States. In each of these regions, the think tank estimates that at least 45 percent of the coal-fired capacity costs more to operate than installing new renewable energy today, and that all of it will cost more by 2030.\n    It is important to note that new coal-fired power plants are already having economic trouble in some markets. In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India  identified a number of coal-fired power plants as \u201cnon-performing assets.\u201d Furthermore, as of May 2019, 19 GW of Indian coal-fired power plants that were being built  have been halted for two or more years, with the Global Energy Monitor identifying financial issues as a factor in most  ...\n And while India has seen a particularly steep fall in its pipeline of new projects, the cancellation of coal-fired power plants is a global issue. Despite net capacity additions of coal-fired power plants rising globally in 2019 for the first time in five years, the preconstruction pipeline shrank, as did construction starts. Overall, the capacity of coal-fired power plants under construction fell 16 percent from 2018 to 2019.  ...\n It is important to note that the slowing trend in new coal projects does not put us anywhere near the goals of the Paris Agreement, which would require an 80 percent decline in coal-fired generation by 2030. But some nations are taking a more active role. South Korea is the third-largest financier of overseas coal projects, and the incoming ruling party has  vowed to stop funding coal plants as part of its Green New Deal.\n Yet even as some plants are canceled, others are still moving forward. For those who continue to fund new coal-fired power plants, there is a tremendous amount of capital at risk, which Carbon Tracker puts at $638 billion. This could have major repercussions not only for individual investors, but for banks in China, Japan and other nations.\n We are walking into a disaster of epic proportions, both for climate and for the economies that are tied to coal. There is still time to turn this around, and it will require funders and governments to take a serious look at the risks that they are taking.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:55:41", "tags": "\u50f5\u5c38,zombie,\u7164\u70ad,coal", "title": "\u50f5\u5c38\u7164", "title_en": "Zombie Coal", "transed": 0, "url": "https://theenergytransition.org/article/zombie-coal/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u50f5\u5c38", "zombie", "\u7164\u70ad", "coal"]}]
