"note_en": "First of all, when I say  little secret, I mean all the passwords, passphrases or private keys you use everyday, everywhere. So, a passphrase protected SSH private key is...  not a little secret.\n  Not so long ago, it was common to use very simple passwords and even the same one in several places or with tiny variations. It was a perfectly normal and predictable behavior. It turned out to be a very bad idea. It was just as predictable, you might say.\n Today, all services, and especially websites, force us to use passwords that are increasingly unpredictable. Sometimes, this password is even imposed to us! This practice is rarely justifiable, but never mind. Things quickly become unmanageable...\n We are not able to keep all of these unpredictable things in our little heads, at least not me, and that&#39;s perfectly fine.\n A little secret being a secret, we don&#39;t want to store it in plain text either. Then we might want to encrypt it. In doing so, and remembering our definition, it is no longer a little secret. It has been replaced by a new one, the one used to decrypt it! This leads us to the inevitable conclusion that:\n  There&#39;s an obvious solution to this problem. We simply encrypt all of these little secrets with a shiny new and unique little secret! As it is unique let&#39;s call it the  master key.\n This solution has a name and you probably know it because you already use it: the  password manager (like your browser). But, for the purposes of this article, let&#39;s rename it the  secret&#39;s daemon. The word  manager was too evil.\n What a happy ending! We finally only have one little secret to keep. So, as before, and for the same reason as before, it must be easy to remember. Because... it was better before.\n  Without even realizing it, you end up securing your entire digital life with a little and simple secret: mails, social networks, online shops, legal identifiers and maybe even your professional secrets... You better not disclose it by mistake!\n I never really liked it. I&#39;ve always tried very hard to use multiple master keys to avoid falling into this trap. And I did well! It has happened to me to disclose some secrets unwittingly and even several times. Well, I have to admit, I&#39;m a very distracted person.\n Let me put it to you another way. You signed a contract, with your blood, that allows a secret&#39;s daemon to keep the most important things of your digital life for a small, easy to remember, word. So that you&#39;ll never have to remember those horrors ever again... Better ?\n Okay, maybe I&#39;m being a little cranky. And I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m saying we shouldn&#39;t use our new demonic friend. As I said above, some people impose you to keep completely random secrets and there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to learn them... That would be neural wastage!\n What I want to show you is that there is a middle ground between the two extremes and it seems to me much better. But first, I want to show you the problem I was facing at the beginning.\n  If you use a UNIX system like me and your productivity is directly related to the use of a terminal then you have certainly solved the problem of storing your secrets by finding the ideal daemon for you.\n Let&#39;s say you use the  pass command which uses  gpg as a backend (they almost all do this and for good reason). You may have noticed that there is a timeout for the master key retention. It&#39;s quite annoying and people often increase the default value. It&#39;s unfortunately a bad idea. This delay is here for a very good reason. Indeed, almost all software running on your machine can read all your secrets during this period.\n As an example, you can look at this little script that will allow you to reveal all your secrets if, somewhere, you used  pass. Nice.\n #!/bin/shfind ~/. *  -name  &#39;*.gpg&#39; |  while  read  -r K _  ;  do  K = &#34; ${ K ##*d-store/ } &#34;  K = &#34; ${ K %.gpg } &#34;  echo  &#34;---  $K  ---&#34;  timeout 2 pass  &#34; $K &#34; 2&gt;/dev/null &lt;/dev/null done\n And of course, we can&#39;t trust everything we run on our machines. I don&#39;t go through the  ./configure script when I want to install new software from source, or the 2000-lines shell script I just piped from  curl to  sh. But these are things I do all the time.\n On the other hand, I cannot disable the  gpg-agent. The master key is the most important secret of our digital life! The more we have to use it, the more we increase the risk of disclosing it. For example by typing it in the wrong window in a hurry... Ideally, I would like to type it only once per session.\n Until now I used several user accounts with different master keys (and some other things) to properly separate my activities. It was very annoying on many aspects but it was doing the job.\n  With all this time available in front of me, I decided to write a small tool,  secret, to solve the problems I had with  pass and  gpg, mainly:\n  The whole crypto part was very easy to set up thanks to the wonderful  hydrogen library.\n While working on this new tool, I was thinking about how I was using passwords so far to see what I could improve. And I realized that what I was doing was in fact pretty stupid.\n   Let&#39;s take an example, we want to register for a new awesome mail service and the new mail is going to be  we@awesome.mail.\n Usually the secret&#39;s daemon will give us a randomly generated password. It will be encrypted with one of our master keys and we will have to store it somewhere and then sync it everywhere. Then, one day, we will have to update it and resynchronize everything...\n In fact, it is possible to produce a secret that seems totally random when it is completely determined by some little secrets. This is well known and this changes everything.\n Let me show you how the command  secret pass can help us. So we want a secret for a mail called  we@awesome.mail for 2020 ? Easy:\n  This secret was generated in a completely determined way. We will get the same answer everywhere if we use the same little secrets: the master key and the words:  mail,  we@awesome.mail and  2020. Which become little secrets. And they are not so hard to remember :)\n Now we want to update our password for 2021. Let&#39;s see what happens if we do like before:\n  Nice! Even if only one byte has changed, the new secret is totally different and, fortunately, safe to use.\n It is important to note that you are, of course, completely free to choose the words used here. There are no rules. It is up to you to make your sentences in such a way that you will never forget it!\n In conclusion: We have a perfectly safe password to use for our new mail.  Nothing has been stored and there&#39;s  nothing to synchronize! It couldn&#39;t be simpler!\n That&#39;s all! But much longer than expected! Thank you for taking the time to read all the way through! I hope you enjoyed it. I would be happy to hear your comments and answer your questions, so feel free :)\n Note 1:  secret is very young project.  Do not use it for serious things yet.\n Note 2: I should point out that in reality you also need the same  ~/.secret file to have exactly the same generated secret. But it&#39;s a choice to improve the overall security of the tool.

"note_en": "Canada has banned assault-style weapons following the murder of 22 people in the worst mass shooting in the country\u2019s history,  Justin Trudeau announced on Friday.\n \u201cThese weapons were designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time. There is no use and no place for such weapons in  Canada,\u201d said the prime minister. \u201cEffective immediately, it is no longer permitted to buy, sell, transport, import or use military-grade assault weapons in this country.\u201d\n After the  Nova Scotia shooting last week, Trudeau said his government intended \u201cstrengthen gun control\u201d to fulfil a campaign promise to restrict certain weapons \u2013 a plan that had initially been derailed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Tuesday that the Nova Scotia gunman, Gabriel Wortman, had been armed with two semi-automatic rifles and several semi-automatic pistols.\n Supt Darren Campbell said that one of the guns could be described \u201cmilitary-style assault rifle\u201d.\n The new ban would probably not have stopped Wortman from obtaining his weapons: he did not have a license to possess or purchase firearms, and police have said they believe the guns were obtained illegally in Canada and the United States.\n The prime minister announced a two-year \u201camnesty period\u201d to allow gun owners to comply with the law. The ban covers 1,500 models and variants of firearms.\n Canada has one of the highest per capita gun ownership rates in the world, at an estimated 34.7 firearms per 100 people, according to the Small Arms Survey in 2018. The country still trails far behind the US, which has close to 120 guns per 100 people.\n While Trudeau promised in 2015 that a Liberal government would make it more difficult for gun owners to acquire certain types of firearms, it wasn\u2019t until the most recent election campaign that the prime minister promised a full ban on \u201cmilitary-style assault weapons\u201d if re-elected.\n \u201cAs long as Canadians are losing their loved ones to gun violence, not enough has changed,\u201d Trudeau said in September. \u201cWe know you do not need a military-grade assault weapon, one designed to kill the largest amount of people in the shortest amount of time, to take down a deer.\u201d\n At present, the Firearms Act does not make a distinction between \u201cmilitary-style\u201d weapons and other type of long guns \u2013 meaning the government would also need to add amend the law.\n Trudeau had also previously promised to ban the Ruger Mini-14 rifle, the weapon used in the 1989  \u00c9cole Polytechnique shooting in Montreal, in which 14 women were murdered.\n The move to heavily restrict access to certain firearms will probably prompt anger from the opposition Conservative party and Canada\u2019s gun lobby \u2013 but a ban of certain weapons can be carried out through cabinet, bypassing the need for legislation.\n \u201cJustin Trudeau is using the current pandemic and the immediate emotion of the horrific attack in Nova Scotia to push the Liberals\u2019 ideological agenda to make major firearms policy changes,\u201d said the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, following Trudeau\u2019s comments. \u201cTaking firearms away from law-abiding citizens does nothing to stop dangerous criminals who obtain their guns illegally.\u201d\n Ken Price, whose daughter Samantha was hurt in  a 2018 mass shooting in Toronto in which two people were killed and 13 injured, said he was \u201cpleased to see movement\u201d on the issue.\n \u201cHaving weapons that can be configured so that they inflict massive damage just doesn\u2019t seem like the right thing to do \u2013 nor is it reflective of what the average Canadian wants,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this still leaves plenty of choice for hunters, fishermen and sport shooters.\u201d\n Price said Canada should also tighten controls on handguns and introduce \u201cred flag laws\u201d \u2013 enabling authorities to remove firearms from individuals deemed a risk to themselves or others \u2013 but said he was \u201cpleased to see movement\u201d on assault weapons.\n An \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d majority of Canadians \u2013 nearly four out of five people \u2013 support the ban, according to a poll from the Angus Reid Institute, released Friday.", "posttime": "2020-05-02

"note_en": "Sometimes we need to compare strings in a case-insensitive manner. For example, you might want \u2018abc\u2019 and \u2018ABC\u2019 to be considered. It is a well-defined problem for ASCII strings. In C/C++, there are basically two common approaches. You can do whole string comparisons:\n  Or you can do character-by-character comparisons, mapping each and every character to a lower-case version and comparing that:\n bool isequal { true } ;\r for  (size_t i  =  0 ; i  &lt; N ; i ++ )  {\r  if  (tolower (string1 [i ] )  != tolower (string2 [i ] ) )  {\r is_the_same  =  false ;\r  break ;\r  }\r }\n Intuitively, the second version is worse because it requires more code. We might also expect it to be slower. How much slower? I wrote a quick benchmark to test it out:\n  I got these results with GNU GCC under Linux. And on a different machine running macOS.\n So for sizeable strings, the character-by-character approach might be 4 to 40 times slower! Results will vary depending on your standard library and of the time of the day. However, in all my tests, strncasecmp is always substantially faster. (Note: Microsoft provides similar functions under different names, see _strnicmp for example.)\n Could you go faster? I tried rolling my own and it runs at about 0.3 ns/byte. So it is faster than the competition under macOS, but slower under Linux. I suspect that the standard library under Linux must rely on a vectorized implementation which might explain how it beats me by a factor of two.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:51", "tags":

"note_en": "This is not going to be a theoretical post with a vague conclusion such as: &#34;Either way is ok, it&#39;s up to you.&#34; That kind of posts doesn&#39;t end up telling you anything lol.\n My answer is a definitive &#34;Yes&#34;. However, if you&#39;re currently employed, you can be better prepared and strategically choose the time to take the jump.\n I joined IndieHacker a year ago. I&#39;ve been employed for 12 years by then and I&#39;ve tried to start many side-projects over the years with various milages. The thinking was &#34;I&#39;ll do this thing on the side and if it explodes, I&#39;ll quit my job to focus on it. If I fail, I can say it&#39;s because it&#39;s a side-project and I wasn&#39;t serious.&#34;\n Last year, I decided this is a waste of time to me. Life is too short to try a few things casually and conclude that it won&#39;t work. So I quit and started working on the idea I am most passionate about.\n 3 months later, when the progress was slower than I thought, I felt &#34;Oh man, I should have prepared better before I quit. What if I go back and keep this as a side project?&#34; My wife then told me &#34;Don&#39;t give up, keep doing it. Give yourself a chance.&#34; So I continued.\n What a classic example of lack of conviction - wishing I could work on a project full-time but when it actually happens, wishing I could work on it part-time. lol.\n So here is what I learned being an indie and why my answer ultimately is &#34;yes&#34;.\n Launching a startup full-time is already hard. Doing it part-time requires MORE discipline to become successful, not LESS. So launching a successful start-up part-time is actually an &#34;ADVANCED&#34; mode, not the &#34;EASY&#34; mode as I thought.\n I get 10X done when working on my product full-time than part-time. When I can work on it every day, there is no context-switching, I can use the most productive part of my day to work on the most important tasks, instead of doing them after a long day of work. That means I can see the progress and get feedback much faster, which keeps me motivated.\n I can sustain momentum and traction. When I can consistently tweet to my followers, release updates, it really creates that sense of progress and boosts my users&#39; confidence in this new company they&#39;ve just heard. It&#39;s impossible to build that momentum when you release once every 2 months or tweets every 2 weeks working part-time.\n Ultimately, the reason we all want to become an indie hacker is to build wealth, instead of selling our time. I am 3X happier working on what I am passionate about and it really boosts my energy level. We are definitely on the right path.\n Lastly, I want to share what I could have done better before I quit. This is completely optional.\n Build an audience. &#34;Shamelessly&#34; promise some products that you will deliver in the future. Don&#39;t feel guilty or insecure that you can&#39;t deliver. You can. Because when you have 1000 users waiting to see what you&#39;ll create, you&#39;ll be motivated to deliver like crazy. And if you ended up pivoting, nobody is going to blame you. They just move on.\n Talk to customers. Figure out the pain points before you actually start building things. I generally find talking to customers to be less energy-draining than building things. Try to avoid quit and then figure out, &#34;Oh, Who am I selling this to?&#34; Which is what I did lol.\n I hope this gives some insight to the many talented developers who are looking to become indie hackers.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:47", "tags": "\u9ed1\u5ba2,\u5e94\u8be5,quit,\u517c\u804c", "title":

"note_en": "Today, we launched a new podcast API for developers. This will allow developers to explore and build unique experiences to help your shows reach new listeners in new ways. If you want to dive into the technical nitty gritty, then jump on over to our  Spotify for Developers blog to learn more about how you can start exploring. And if you want to learn more about what this means for you and your show, we\u2019re here to walk you through it.\n Simply put, an API allows developers to build their own products that integrate with a larger platform (like Spotify). Our API, just like any other API, simply provides access, but does not prescribe how it&#39;s used; the only limit to how an API is used is a developer\u2019s creativity. In this case, it means third-party developers will be able to build really powerful new experiences for listeners leveraging Spotify&#39;s podcast ecosystem.\n Here at Spotify, we\u2019ve had our own music-related APIs set up for over a decade and in that time we\u2019ve seen developers create awesome experiences for their users. For example, the popular playlist app Dubolt helps users discover new tracks and artists that sound like old favorites. And over at Popularity Contest, a web app that\u2019s powered in part by Spotify\u2019s Web API, users are presented with two artists at random and have to guess which one is more popular on the platform.\n The new podcast API will function in similar ways to our music-related APIs by empowering developers to build unique experiences for listeners that leverages all of the public (and in this case podcast-related) data on Spotify. That means access to show and episode titles, description, and art. It will also allow developers to programmatically search Spotify\u2019s catalog of over 700,000 podcasts and fetch information about shows and episodes.\n Plus, if listeners grant apps the access, those that are developed using the podcast API could create ways to follow or unfollow podcasts on behalf of a user, see any currently playing podcasts, list the shows that a user has followed, and see how much of a given podcast episode has already been streamed.\n We can\u2019t wait to see what developers will come up with using this API and watch how these new ideas and projects might serve our podcast creators and increase discoverability. And any innovation \u2014 whether it be an app that helps you share what you\u2019re listening to with friends or a calendar integration that sets an alert for when your favorite show is expected to release a new episode\u2014will ultimately provide listeners with more ways to experience your podcast.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:44", "tags": "\u64ad\u5ba2,spotify,introduces,api", "title": "Spotify\u63a8\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u64ad\u5ba2API", "title_en": "Spotify Introduces a New Podcast API", "transed": 0, "url": "https://podcasters.spotify.com/blog/spotify-introduces-new-podcast-api", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u64ad\u5ba2", "spotify", "api"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b63445106b3eb7a38d5d84d1d3ed0c6b.jpg", "infoid": 1000143, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6811\u8393\u6d3e\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7167\u76f8\u677f\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u6781\u5927\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e7f\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684DIY\u7535\u8111\u7231\u597d\u8005\u548c\u7231\u597d\u8005\u7684\u6444\u5f71\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u6b3e\u76f8\u673a\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u76f8\u673a\u201d\uff0c\u75311230\u4e07\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u80cc\u9762\u7167\u660e\u578b\u7d22\u5c3cIMX477\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c1.55\u5fae\u7c73\u50cf\u7d20\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\n\u4e4b\u524d\u4e5f\u6709\u5b98\u65b9\u7684Raspberry Pi\u76f8\u673a\u4e3b\u677f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8981\u5c0f\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7126\u8ddd\u955c\u5934\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u76f8\u673a\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u7684C-\u548cCS-\u652f\u67b6\u955c\u5934\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u540e\u7f6e\u7126\u8ddd\u3002\u9996\u6279\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u51c6\u7684\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u5305\u62ec\u552e\u4ef725\u7f8e\u5143\u76846 mm CS\u5b89\u88c5\u578b\u955c\u5934\u548c50\u7f8e\u5143\u768416 mm C\u5b89\u88c5\u578b\u955c\u5934\u3002\n\u4e3b\u677f\u5177\u6709CS\u5b89\u88c5\uff0c\u4f46\u9644\u5e26C\u5b89\u88c5\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u4ea7\u54c1\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u5730\u5b89\u88c5\u5404\u79cd\u5404\u6837\u7684\u955c\u7247\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4f73\u80fd(Canon)70-200 mm f/2.8\u7684\u7535\u8def\u677f\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u4e3b\u610f\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\u90fd\u5f88\u68d2\uff1a\n\u6811\u8393PI\u7684\u62e5\u6709\u8005\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u4ece\u5bb6\u5ead\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u5230DIY\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u9879\u76ee\u3002\u6811\u8393PI\u51fa\u7248\u793e\u6b63\u5728\u51fa\u7248\u4e00\u672c\u65b0\u7684PI\u76f8\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u53d1\u552e10 GB(12.50\u7f8e\u5143)\u7684\u5370\u5237\u7248\u6216PDF\u514d\u8d39\u7248\u3002\n\u8fd9\u6b3e\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u76f8\u673a\u517c\u5bb9\u4ece1Model B\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6240\u6709Raspberry Pi\u7535\u8111\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u7684800\u4e07\u50cf\u7d20\u76f8\u673a\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\u3001\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u9009\u9879\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u65b0\u76f8\u673a\u5c06\u4e8e\u4eca\u5929\u5f00\u59cb\u9500\u552e\uff0c\u552e\u4ef750\u7f8e\u5143\u3002", "note_en": "The Raspberry Pi Foundation has announced a new camera board that should dramatically improve the photographic capabilities available to the popular DIY computer\u2019s enthusiasts and hobbyists. It\u2019s called the  High Quality Camera, and it\u2019s built around a 12.3-megapixel backside-illuminated Sony IMX477 sensor with 1.55-micron pixels.\n There have been official Raspberry Pi camera boards before, but they used much smaller, lower resolution sensors and relied on fixed-focus lenses. The High Quality Camera, however, supports interchangeable C- and CS-mount lenses and offers adjustable back focus. The first options to be available through approved resellers include a $25 6mm CS-mount lens and a $50 16mm C-mount lens.\n The board has a CS mount but comes with a C-mount adapter. This means that it\u2019ll be easy to attach a wide variety of lenses through third-party products. Here, for example, is what the board looks like with a Canon 70-200mm f/2.8, which is probably not a good idea but awesome anyway:\n   Raspberry Pi owners have been using camera modules for projects ranging from home security systems to DIY drone setups. Raspberry Pi Press is publishing a new guide to using cameras with the Pi,  available today for \u00a310 ($12.50) in print or  free as a PDF.\n The High Quality Camera is compatible with all Raspberry Pi computers from the 1 Model B onward, and the previous 8-megapixel camera module will continue to be available as a cheaper, smaller option. The new camera will  go on sale today for $50.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:42", "tags": "\u76f8\u673a,raspberry pi,\u66f4\u6362,pi,camera", "title":

"note_en": "We\u2019re pleased to announce a new member of the Raspberry Pi camera family: the 12.3-megapixel High Quality Camera,  available today for just $50, alongside a range of interchangeable lenses starting at $25.\n 12.3 megapixel Sony IMX477 sensor, 7.9mm diagonal image size, and back-illuminated sensor architecture, with adjustable back focus and support for C- and CS-\u2026\n  It\u2019s really rather good, as you can see from this shot of Cambridge\u2019s finest bit of perpendicular architecture.\n     There has always been a big overlap between Raspberry Pi hackers and camera hackers. Even back in 2012, people (okay, substantially  Dave Hunt) were  finding  interesting  ways to squeeze more functionality out of DSLR cameras using their Raspberry Pi computers.\n   In 2013, we  launched our first camera board, built around the OmniVision OV5647 5\u2011megapixel sensor, followed rapidly by the original Pi NoIR board, with infrared sensitivity and a little magic square of blue plastic. Before long, people were attaching them to  telescopes and using them to monitor plant health from  drones (using the aforementioned little square of plastic).\n  Sadly, OV5647 went end-of-life in 2015, and the 5-megapixel camera has the distinction of being one of only three products (along with the original Raspberry Pi 1 and the official WiFi dongle) that we\u2019ve ever discontinued.  Its replacement, built around the 8-megapixel Sony IMX219 sensor, launched in April 2016; it has found a home in all sorts of cool projects, from line-followers to  cucumber sorters, ever since. Going through our sales figures while writing this post, we were amazed to discover  ...\n  Versatile though they are, there are limitations to mobile phone-type fixed-focus modules. The sensors themselves are relatively small, which translates into a lower signal-to-noise ratio and poorer low-light performance; and of course there is no option to replace the lens assembly with a more expensive one, or one with different optical properties. These are the shortcomings that the High Quality Camera is designed to address.\n       1.55\u03bcm \u00d7 1.55\u03bcm pixel size \u2013 double the pixel area of IMX219\n 12.3 megapixel Sony IMX477 sensor, 7.9mm diagonal sensor size, and back-illuminated sensor architecture, with adjustable back focus and support for C- and CS\u2026\n  We expect that over time people will use quite a wide variety of lenses, but for starters our Approved Resellers will be offering a couple of options: a 6 mm CS\u2011mount lens at $25, and a very shiny 16 mm C-mount lens priced at $50.\n   Also out today is our new  Official Raspberry Pi Camera Guide, covering both the familiar Raspberry Pi Camera Module and the new Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera.\n  Our new guide, published by  Raspberry Pi Press, walks you through setting up and using your camera with your Raspberry Pi computer. You\u2019ll also learn how to use filters and effects to enhance your photos and videos, and how to set up creative projects such as stop-motion animation stations, wildlife cameras, smart doorbells, and much more.\n  You can purchase the book in print today  from the Raspberry Pi Press store for \u00a310, or download the  PDF for free from The MagPi magazine website.\n  As with every product we build, the High Quality Camera has taught us interesting new things, in this case about producing precision-machined aluminium components at scale (and to think we thought injection moulding was hard!). Getting this right has been something of a labour of love for me over the past three years, designing the hardware and getting it to production. Naush Patuck tuned the VideoCore IV ISP for this sensor; David Plowman helped with lens evaluation; Phil King  ...\n We\u2019d like to acknowledge Phil Holden at Sony in San Jose, the manufacturing team at Sony UK Tec in Pencoed for their camera test and assembly expertise, and Shenzhen O-HN Optoelectronic for solving our precision engineering challenges.\n   The High Quality Camera is compatible with almost all Raspberry Pi models, from the original Raspberry Pi 1 Model B onward. Some very early Raspberry Pi Zero boards from the start of 2016 lack a camera connector, and other Zero users will need the same adapter FPC that is used with Camera Module v2.\n  The regular and infrared versions of Camera Module v2 will still be available. The High Quality Camera does not supersede it. Instead, it provides a different tradeoff between price, performance, and size.\n  You can use C- and CS-mount lenses out of the box (C-mount lenses use the included C-CS adapter). Third-party adapters are available from a wide variety of lens standards to CS-mount, so it is possible to connect any lens that meets the back\u2011focus requirements.\n We\u2019re looking forward to seeing the oldest and/or weirdest lenses anyone can get working, but here\u2019s one for starters, courtesy of  Fiacre.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:38", "tags": "\u76f8\u673a,raspberry

"note_en": "This approach, which relies on the willingness of Swedes to abide by distancing guidelines, has drawn praise from the WHO\n Sweden&#39;s experiment seeking to confer &#34;herd immunity&#34; against COVID-19 on its population -- and not relying heavily on\u00a0movement restrictions and strict social distancing -- isn&#39;t going well for its senior citizens.\n Its relaxed approach compared to its locked down Nordic neighbors relies mostly on residents voluntarily complying with strict but voluntary distancing standards. Sweden, which has a population of 10 million, has also banned gatherings of more than 50 people, but has allowed shops, bars and primary schools to remain open.\n It has now, however, barred visits to nursing homes and ordered people over 70 to self-isolate if they feel ill. Unfortunately, senior citizens are being infected by nursing home staff that can freely move about in society.\n As a result, one-in-three COVID-19 deaths has taken place in care facilities for the elderly, admitted Dr.  Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist and the architect of the country&#39;s relaxed approach to dealing with the pandemic.\n  Sweden\u2019s loose restrictions were assailed by 2,300 academics that signed a letter last month calling for the government to reconsider its controversial approach.\n \u201cWe must establish control over the situation, we cannot head into a situation where we get complete chaos. No one has tried this route, so why should we test it first in Sweden, without informed consent?\u201d said Cecilia Soderberg-Naucler, a professor at the Karolinska Institute.\n Despite these alarming realities, Sweden&#39;s approach was still lauded by the World Health Organization (WHO). Surprisingly, WHO has praised Sweden as a \u201cmodel\u201d for battling COVID-19.\n   There are \u201clessons to be learned\u201d from Sweden, which is relying on the self-discipline of its citizens to defeat the pandemic, contended\u00a0 Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO&#39;s Health Emergencies Program, which is responsible for the international containment and treatment of COVID-19.\n \u201cI think there\u2019s a perception out that Sweden has not put in control measures and just has allowed the disease to spread,\u201d noted Dr. Ryan. \u201cNothing can be further from the truth.\u201d\n On Wednesday, Dr. Ryan told the media instead of lockdowns, Sweden has \u201cput in place a very strong public policy around social distancing, around caring and protecting people in long term care facilities.\u201d\n   He said what Sweden has done differently is to rely heavily on its relationship with its citizenry and the ability and willingness of Swedes to implement self-distancing and self-regulate.\n \u201cIn that sense, they have implemented public policy through that partnership with the population,\u201d according to Dr. Ryan.\n He also pointed out Sweden has accelerated coronavirus testing while having adequate hospital capacity to cope with any spike in cases.\n \u201cI think if we are to reach a new normal, Sweden represents a model if we wish to get back to a society in which we don\u2019t have lockdowns,\u201d claimed Dr. Ryan.\n Sweden ranks 21st on the list of the most heavily infected countries in the world. It had 20,302 confirmed cases and 2,462 deaths as of 05:48 GMT on Thursday. This total is far higher than its Nordic neighbors of Norway, Denmark and Finland.\n Denmark, with a population of 5.8 million, reports 9,206 cases and 443 deaths. Norway has 7,680 cases and 207 deaths among 5.4 million. Finland has 4,906 cases and 206 deaths out of a population of 5.5 million.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:31", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u7ec4\u7ec7,sweden,\u745e\u5178",

"note_en": "Zoom has admitted it doesn\u2019t have 300 million daily active users. The admission came after  The Verge noticed the company had quietly edited a blog post making the claim earlier this month. Zoom  originally stated it had \u201cmore than 300 million daily users\u201d and that \u201cmore than 300 million people around the world are using Zoom during this challenging time.\u201d Zoom later  deleted these references from the original blog post, and now claims \u201c300 million daily Zoom meeting participants.\u201d\n The difference between a daily active user (DAU) and \u201cmeeting participant\u201d is significant. Daily meeting participants can be counted multiple times: if you have five Zoom meetings in a day then you\u2019re counted five times. A DAU is counted once per day, and is commonly used by companies to measure service usage. Only counting meeting participants is an easy, somewhat misleading, way to make your platform usage seem larger than it is.\n The misleading blog was edited on April 24th, a day after the numbers made headlines worldwide. After  The Verge reached out for comment from Zoom, the company added a note to the blog post admitting the error yesterday, and provided the following statement:\n \u201cWe are humbled and proud to help over 300 million daily meeting participants stay connected during this pandemic. In a blog post on April 22, we unintentionally referred to these participants as \u201cusers\u201d and \u201cpeople.\u201d When we realized this error, we adjusted the wording to \u201cparticipants.\u201d This was a genuine oversight on our part.\u201d\n Zoom\u2019s growth has been impressive, but the company has not actually provided a daily active user count. Zoom usage has soared from 10 million daily meeting participants back in December to 300 million this month. Rivals like Microsoft Teams and Google Meet appear to be closing the gap, though. Microsoft said yesterday it now has  75 million daily active users of Teams, a jump from 70 percent in a month. Microsoft also recorded 200 million meeting participants in a single day this month.\n Google Meet is adding roughly 3 million new users each day, and hit  over 100 million daily Meet meeting participants recently. Cisco also revealed earlier this month that it has a total of 300 million Webex users, and saw sign-ups close to 240,000 in a 24-hour period. Cisco has not yet provided daily meeting participant numbers, or daily active user counts.\n Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and others are still  chasing Zoom with new features and free services. Google made its Meet service free this week, and both Microsoft and Google have increased how many people you can see simultaneously in response to Zoom\u2019s popular gallery view.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:26", "tags": "\u6570\u5b57,meeting,zoom", "title": "Zoom\u66f4\u6b63\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b57\uff1a\u79f0\u6bcf\u5929\u67093\u4ebf\u4f1a\u8bae\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005", "title_en": "Zoom corrects usage numbers: says it has 300M daily meeting participants", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242421/zoom-300-million-users-incorrect-meeting-participants-statement", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u6570\u5b57", "meeting", "zoom"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "21bcbfd65bbeb91b79a525a38c323e78.jpg", "infoid": 1000138, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6309\u7167\u60ef\u4f8b\uff0c\u7a7a\u519b\u4e0d\u4f1a\u900f\u9732X-37B\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8f7d\u8377\u3002\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u5bf9OTV-5\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e86\u4f8b\u5916\u3002\u6267\u884c\u90a3\u6b21\u4efb\u52a1\u7684X-37B\u642d\u8f7d\u4e86\u7531\u7a7a\u519b\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5236\u9020\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u70ed\u6563\u5e03\u5668\u3002\u6839\u636e\u7a7a\u519b\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u6563\u5e03\u5668\u5e2e\u52a9\u201c\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u548c\u632f\u8361\u70ed\u7ba1\u6280\u672f\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff1a\u201cX-37B\u672c\u8eab\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u957f\uff0c\u8fd9\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9X-37B\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u2026\u2026", "note_en": "The Air Force as a matter of habit does not disclose the X-37B\u2019s payloads.
