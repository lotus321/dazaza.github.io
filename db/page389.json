"note_en": "&#34;We have to tune the sizes of the jets releasing the propellants to enhance the mixing for a local hydrogen-oxygen mixture,&#34; Ahmed said. &#34;So, when the rotating explosion comes by for this fresh mixture, it&#39;s still sustained. Because if you have your composition mixture slightly off, it will tend to deflagrate, or burn slowly instead of detonating.&#34; Ahmed&#39;s team also had to capture evidence of their finding. They did this by injecting a tracer in the hydrogen fuel flow and quantifying the detonation waves using a high-speed camera. &#34;You need the tracer to actually see that explosion that is happening inside and track its motion,&#34; he said. &#34;Developing this method to characterize the detonation wave dynamics is another contribution of this article.&#34; William Hargus, lead of the Air Force Research Laboratory&#39;s Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine Program, is a co-author of the study and began working with Ahmed on the project last summer. &#34;As an advanced propulsion spectroscopist, I recognized some of the unique challenges in the observation of hydrogen-detonation structures,&#34; Hargus said. &#34;After consulting with Professor Ahmed, we were able to formulate a slightly modified experimental apparatus that significantly increased the relevant signal strength.&#34; &#34;These research results already are having repercussions across the international research community,&#34; Hargus said. &#34;Several projects are now re-examining hydrogen detonation combustion within rotating detonation rocket engines because of these results. I am very proud to be associated with this high-quality research.&#34; Research paper Related Links   University of Central Florida   Rocket Science News at Space-Travel.Com  Thanks for being there; We need your help.

"note_en": "Even as COVID-19 cases mount, companies are making plans to reopen. Everyone is keen to get back to work, but epidemiologists caution that a rush to recommence business as usual could spark a second wave of fatalities, and that employers need to implement measures to prevent virus transmission among workers, or between workers and customers. Much of the planning \u2014by real-estate companies, architects, and public-health officials \u2014revolves around implementing new technology, or renovating spaces  ...\n   But redesigning  space is not the only option for businesses that want to reopen while lowering the risk of a second wave. They can redesign their  time, too. Reducing hours, without cutting salaries, might help many companies speed up the return to normalcy, and help them prepare for the future as well.\n The logic is simple. About  70 percent of offices in the United States are open plan, with people working at desks four or five feet wide and 30 inches deep, often surrounded by co-workers on three sides, and sharing common spaces like elevators, hallways, meeting rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms. To follow OSHA recommendations and enforce social distancing in the office without leasing new square footage, companies will have to reduce the number of people in an office by about half.\n    Shortening work hours might seem counterintuitive for companies that value nimbleness and productivity, and that need to clear their balance sheets, but a large body of evidence suggests that this approach pays dividends. In recent years, hundreds of forward-looking companies have pioneered four-day weeks or six-hour days, without cutting salaries. These  companiesare big and small, operate in a variety of industries, and are all over the world. They bring everyone together around the challenge  ...\n  A shorter workweek helps these companies be more productive, not less, and more attractive to first-rate talent. At Pursuit Marketing, a call center in Glasgow, Scotland, productivity went up 40 percent after the company implemented a four-day week, and annual staff turnover has dropped to an unheard-of 2 percent. Revenues at Woowa Brothers, a South Korean online delivery company, have  increased more than tenfoldsince it cut working hours in 2015; even though it \u2019s a start-up, it now competes  ...\n   A number of companies, particularly retail stores and services, put people on six-hour shifts but stay open 12 hours a day. \u00a0For example, the Toyota repair center in Gothenburg, Sweden, has operated on this schedule for nearly 20 years. With a six-hour shift, mechanics are able to work harder and faster, then hand off unfinished tasks, so that a customer can drop off a car early in the morning and have major repairs finished that evening.\n In Finland, during a recession in the late 1990s, the federal government sponsored a  program called the \u201c6+6 Plan,\u201d under which municipal offices were open for 12 hours each day and staffed by civil servants on six-hour shifts. During the two years this program was in effect, public satisfaction with government services went up, and most employees reported improved work-life balance.\n Other companies in the shorter-hours movement combine four-day workweeks and flexible schedules. At the Philadelphia-based software company Wildbit, people take either Monday or Friday off, so the company can provide uninterrupted customer service. At the London medical-documentation company Synergy Vision, employees rotate weekdays off to keep the office open five days a week.\n    Companies can adapt these techniques to both reopen safely and serve their customers \u2019needs. Running two six-hour shifts would offer customers the convenience of longer hours, and could be attractive to businesses eager to recover sales lost during the lockdown. Companies that want to maintain an eight-hour day could reopen with less-crowded offices if half the staff worked Monday through Thursday, half worked Tuesday through Friday, and everyone worked from home one to two days a week  ...\n Businesses seeking to reopen their offices can borrow more than schedules from the innovative companies in the shorter-hours movement. Companies that move to four-day weeks often replace long, meandering meetings with short, small, and focused get-togethers. A side benefit to that approach, for pandemic times, is fewer people together in poorly ventilated rooms. And these companies automate many repetitive tasks and invest more in online systems, reducing the need for physical contact  ...\n  An economic crisis might not sound like the right time to try something radical. But companies usually shorten hours after a founder burns out, the company\u2019s finances take a hit, or some other problem signals a need for change. The challenge of adjusting to a new schedule makes employees more flexible in other areas, and encourages companies to become more nimble. That\u2019s a quality companies will need as long as the pandemic lasts, and when the next black swan appears.\n The pandemic has already taken more than 55,000 lives in the United States, brought economic and systemic inequalities to light, exposed weaknesses in our health-care system and economy, and dredged up ugly social Darwinism (\u201c Sacrifice the weak, reopen Tennessee\u201d) that \u2019s been lurking under our nation \u2019s surface.

When will case numbers peak?\n To answer those  questions, many hospital planners, media outlets, and government bodies \u2014 including the White House \u2014 relied heavily on   one particular model out of the many that have been published in the past two months: the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).\n The model first estimated in late March that there\u2019d be fewer than 161,000 deaths total in the US; in early April, it revised its projections to say the total death toll through August was \u201cprojected to be 60,415\u201d (though it acknowledged the range could be between 31,221 and 126,703).\n The model has been  cited often by the White House and has informed its policymaking. But it may have led the administration astray: The IHME has consistently forecast many fewer deaths than most other models, largely because the IHME model projects that deaths will decline rapidly after the peak \u2014 an assumption that has not been borne out.\n On Wednesday, the US death count passed the 60,000 mark that the IHME model had said was the likely total cumulative death toll. The IHME on April 29  released a new update raising its estimates for total deaths to 72,433, but that, too, looks likely to be proved an underestimate as soon as next week. Even its upper bound on deaths \u2014now listed as 114,228 by August  ...\n One analysis of the IHME model  found that its next-day death predictions for each state  were outside its 95 percent confidence interval 70 percent of the time \u2014 meaning the actual death numbers fell outside the range it projected 70 percent of the time. That\u2019s not great! (A recent revision by IHME  fixed that issue; more on this below.)\n This track record has led some experts to criticize the model.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a model that most of us in the infectious disease epidemiology field think is well suited\u201d to making projections about Covid-19, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch  told reporters.\n But if that\u2019s the case, how  has it risen to such prominence among policymakers? Other models have done better than IHME\u2019s at predicting the course of the epidemic, and many of them use approaches epidemiologists believe are more promising. Yet it\u2019s the IHME model that has generally   guided policymakers,  for the most part, in the direction of focusing on a  ...\n One potential explanation for its outsize influence:  Some of the factors that make the IHME model unreliable at predicting the virus may have gotten people to pay attention  to it. For one thing, it\u2019s more simplistic compared to other models. That means it can be applied in ways more complicated models could not, such as providing  state-level projections  ...\n Meanwhile, its narrow confidence intervals for state-by-state estimates meant it had quotable (and optimistic)  topline numbers. A confidence interval represents a range of numbers wherein the model is very confident the true value will lie.  A narrow range that gives  \u201can appearance of certainty  is seductive when the world is desperate to know what lies ahead,  ...\n The criticism of the IHME model, and an emerging debate over epidemiology models more broadly, has brought to light important challenges in the fight against the coronavirus. Good planning requires good projections. Models are needed to help predict resurgences and spot a potential second wave. Dissecting what the IHME model got wrong, what other models  ...\n  Models of disease spread are meant to help decision-makers in an environment where math will outperform intuitions. Most people have a hard time thinking about  exponential growth, which is why many were taken by surprise in March as the virus spread. That\u2019s why models can be useful.\n Models usually lay out some foundational assumptions and offer projections based on those assumptions. The IHME model seeks to project death rates and hospitalization rates assuming widespread social distancing and strong measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Since testing is so unreliable at identifying the infection rate, the model uses only  ...\n That projected hospitalization rate was one of the things that set it apart, IHME researcher Ali Mokdad told me. It was one of the few models offering that projection, and it was actionable information governments could grab on to and plan around.\n Another reason it rose in prominence was IHME\u2019s decision to model the effects of strong social distancing measures.  That choice proved correct \u2014 strong measures were indeed taken across the US \u2014 and the lower death numbers the model churned out as a result reportedly led to it being  received favorably by the Trump administration.\n But as the weeks have passed, it has become clear that the IHME \u2019s projections have been too optimistic, and slow to adjust to reflect the fact that deaths have plateaued rather than rapidly decreasing to zero. The IHME has been regularly updating its model as new data comes in, but the updates have often been slow enough that the numbers are absurd  ...\n Mokdad told me when we talked that a fix was in the works, and it went up a few days later: The model now projects 73,433 deaths by August. That, too, is probably an underestimate \u2014  most other models project that total will be reached next week.\n In the IHME\u2019s defense, it does offer a 95 percent confidence interval that is more accurate than the topline numbers.  That range goes from 59,343 \u2014 significantly less than the number of people already dead of the virus \u2014 to 114,228. That might sound like a wide range, but it\u2019s still optimistic, and the actual toll  is on track to lie outside that  ...\n That\u2019s one of the core complaints about the IHME model: its confidence intervals seem too narrow, both for its next-day and  several-months-ahead predictions. For instance, when used to predict the number of deaths in a state the very next day (which doesn\u2019t require any complex modeling of the long-term effects of uncertain policies),  other researchers  ...\n The day-to-day numbers are jumpy because some counties don \u2019t report numbers every day, Mokdad told me. \u201cThe model is kind of confused because states are not reporting deaths consistently, \u201dhe said, adding, \u201cThe model assumes deaths will increase and then come back down, \u201dand so it reacts poorly when deaths instead vary day to day. Smoothing over  ...\n Indeed, the latest update to the model solves the problem where the next-day deaths are usually outside the model\u2019s confidence interval by giving the model extremely wide confidence intervals. That\u2019s commendable. It is better to be honest about your extremely high uncertainty than to claim certainty you don\u2019t have.\n That might lead to unsatisfying models with extremely wide ranges \u2014 176 to 3,885 deaths today  \u2014 but if that\u2019s an accurate reflection of the state of uncertainty, then so be it.  It \u2019s better to have a wide confidence interval, acknowledging your uncertainty, than to have a narrow one that is usually wrong. And if next-day deaths are usually wrong,  ...\n  (But while the IHME has made its day-to-day confidence intervals larger, it still has very narrow confidence intervals for its projections several weeks into the future \u2014 which is odd, as there should be even more uncertainty about those.)\n An even bigger issue with the IHME model is that  the way the model is published can obscure its problems. When it\u2019s updated, it can be hard to see what its old, obviated predictions were. A website,  covid-projections.com, has been set up so that you can look at the predictions made by old versions of the IHME model (and at the history of other  ...\n The IHME model is unusual compared to other epidemiological models for its design, too. While most of the models use standard epidemiology modeling tactics like SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered modeling) or use computer simulations, the IHME model is effectively just about fitting a curve from early data in China and Italy to  ...\n The IHME model is based \u201con a statistical model with no epidemiologic basis,\u201d the  Annals of Internal Medicine critique argues.\n  \u201cWe\u2019re willing to make a forecast. Most academics want to hedge their bets and not be found to ever be wrong,\u201d IHME director Christopher Murray  told Politico. \u201cThat\u2019s not useful for a planner \u2014 you can\u2019t go to a hospital and say you might need 1,000 ventilators, or you might need 5,000.\u201d\n  The change to the model has certainly improved it, but some problems with the confidence intervals remain.  The new model acknowledges extremely high uncertainty about what will happen tomorrow \u2014 in my state, California, it says there will be between 5 and 103 deaths tomorrow. That\u2019s a really wide range.\n But on May 20, the model is entirely sure there will be zero deaths. The 95 percent confidence interval runs from zero deaths to ... zero deaths.\n   That\u2019s an extremely strong claim. I pressed the IHME team about whether they were sure of it. Mokdad said the model\u2019s zero-deaths predictions were correct: \u201cBased on the graph, in certain states, yes \u2014 in California, May 17, zero. The virus is not circulating anymore; you would expect it to go to zero.\u201d\n But the virus is still circulating in California. On April 28, there were 1,187 new cases  reported in the state. Even if all infections in California stopped instantly today, it is likely that some already infected people would die in mid-May or later.\n California \u2019s case numbers (like those of many states) are declining, but only slowly, as social distancing has limited the spread of the virus but not fully stopped it. That ties into another problem with the IHME model: It assumes that social distancing measures, once put in place, are always sufficient to rapidly decrease case  ...\n In the report explaining the model, the researchers write that they look at four measures: \u201cSchool closures, non-essential business closures including bars and restaurants, stay-at-home recommendations, and travel restrictions including public transport closures. Days with 1 measure were counted as 0.67 equivalents, days with 2 measures  ...\n In other words, the model has a built-in assumption that once three of those measures have been put into place, cases will rapidly fall to zero. No new data can change that assumption, which is why the model continues to project zero deaths by mid-May in any area that hasn \u2019t lifted social distancing restrictions, even though case  ...\n There are many similar frustratingly confident predictions: On July 12, the model says, we\u2019ll need between 0 and 12 hospital beds in the whole US for coronavirus patients, and there will be 0 deaths at any point after July 12.\n Why the IHME model\u2019s problems shouldn\u2019t be used as an indictment of epidemiology more broadly\n All these concerns make it frustrating to many epidemiologists that the IHME model is the one being widely used and cited. \u201cThat the IHME model keeps changing is evidence of its lack of reliability as a predictive tool,\u201d epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni  told Stat Newsin an article about the problems with the model. \u201cThat it is being  ...\n Alex Merz, a microbiologist at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Medicine, has  written that \u201c @IHME_UW\u2019s overly optimistic modeling projections contributed to this debacle\u201d of the coronavirus\u2019s rapid spread in the US,  and condemned their \u201camazing shrinking error band that, preposterously, constricts to zero uncertainty  ...\n The IHME model has  also brought the discipline under fire from other fields. Tyler Cowen, whose widely read blog Marginal Revolution has  linked many of the papers demonstrating how poorly the IHME model works, argued \u201cnow really is the time to be asking tough questions about epidemiology, and yes, epidemiologists.\u201d\n That\u2019s not fair, many epidemiologists say \u2014 the model doesn\u2019t use any of the standard tools of the discipline, and they  hate it too.\n \u201cThat the IHME model keeps changing is evidence of its lack of reliability as a predictive tool\u201d\n \u201cThe IHME approach departs from classic epidemiological modeling,\u201d epidemiological modelers at the University of Texas at Austin  argued. \u201cRather than using systems of equations to project the person-to-person transmission of the virus, the [IHME] model postulates that COVID-19 deaths will rise exponentially and then decline  ...\n So it might not be fair to draw conclusions about the field as a whole from one model that mostly avoided using its standard tools.\n Moreover,  the public should be aware that there are  better models. The Imperial College model that the British government relied on to inform their country \u2019s coronavirus strategy has held up reasonably well, with case numbers loosely tracking the model \u2019s predictions for what would happen if social distancing were implemented  ...\n Other models, employing more standard epidemiological approaches, perform even better \u2014 though usually in narrower domains, like trying to project just the peak of the outbreak, or just the rate of new cases.\n The IHME team says their model performed pretty well on key problems like predicting the peak in most states  (it\u2019ll be clear in coming weeks how true that is)  and that they \u2019re continuing to revise it to make it better. Meanwhile, as the debate over epidemiological models heats up, it \u2019s fair to say that holding the  ...\n   The flaws I \u2019ve noted above were also features that made the model appealing when it was first launched. It was optimistic, projecting lower deaths than other models. It was clear and precise, with narrow confidence intervals. It projected hospitalizations, which few others were doing \u2014though those projections turned  ...\n But it turns out the uncertainty being reflected in a lot of other, better models is showing up for a reason \u2014 there really is still a lot unknown about the course this disease will take.\n As my colleague Matt Yglesias  has written, \u201cWe need to value scientists and listen to experts, but part of listening means understanding that right now, what they\u2019re saying is that they do not have all the answers.\u201d\n Given the enormous uncertainty ahead, responsible scientists are avoiding giving dramatic topline numbers they\u2019re unsure of, emphasizing the very wide confidence intervals on their estimates, and being careful not to publish results that the Trump administration or the public may interpret as definitive.\n But people keep searching for definitive answers (understandably so), and so any model that is presented more confidently will rise to prominence over models that are humbler and better reflect the confusion.\n The IHME model is one of  several released by researchers at the University of Washington, but it has been far more widely cited and discussed than the others  \u2014 despite being less accurate.\n Ultimately, the problem may not be that some models are inaccurate. It was predictable that some models would be inaccurate, with the situation as confusing as it is. There are dozens of models, and ideally we \u2019d be doing something like aggregating them and weighting each according to how well it has performed  ...\n The current process is almost exactly the opposite of that. Most models are nearly ignored, while a few are cited by the White House and widely referred to in the press. The process that makes some models prominent is not a process that picks out the best of the best \u2014and in fact, it may actively be picking out  ...\n In other words, the fact that many epidemiological models are performing badly isn\u2019t great, but it could be part of a productive process of arriving at better models.  But the media, policymakers, and the public need to be conscious of what kind of models we gravitate to and why. If we elevate the ones we like  ...\n  Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter  and we\u2019ll send you a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling the world\u2019s biggest challenges \u2014 and how to get better at doing good.\n By signing up, you agree to our  Privacy Notice and European users agree to the data transfer policy.

"note_en": "To construct this analysis, cost of living was estimated by taking the sum of the rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in the city centre and the cost of living for 1 person excluding rent off of  Numbeo . This sum was then converted from whatever currency it was in to USD and taxes were determined using the website  Neuvoo while average base salaries were taken from Glassdoor.\n  The cities chosen for comparison were Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Edmonton, Calgary, Kitchener, Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, New York City, Boston, Portland, Austin, Washington DC, Denver, Chicago, Zurich, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Dublin, and Berlin. To determine this list, I created an initial list of cities from hearsay, the  2019 Scoring Tech Talent in North America report, as well as  The European Talent Landscape report. I then filtered the list by  ...\n  To start my analysis, I went through Glassdoor and obtained the average base salary for &#34;Software Engineer&#34; in each city. This is not a perfect means of capturing the average salary of software developers as it is possible that folks are posting their salaries under titles such as Back-end Developer or something else but doing it this way offers a reasonable proxy.\n  From the chart above, we see that the usual hearsay about software developer salaries seem to be validated as American salaries tend to be higher than Canadian and European salaries with San Francisco exceeding everyone else. The only surprising result (at least to me) from this chart would be that the average salary in Zurich seems to be comparable to San Francisco.\n   When considering cost of living, nothing surprising pops out. San Francisco and New York City top the list with other well-known cities such as Toronto, Vancouver, and Seattle trailing them. However, considering the absolute cost of living isn&#39;t particularly useful as the income one makes within that city might make living there worth the cost. Hence, it is useful to take a look at the percentage of one&#39;s salary that cost of living can take up.\n  From these percentages, we can see that Toronto and Vancouver have a cost of living that is surprisingly similar to San Francisco and New York City once we adjust for incomes which explains much of the dissatisfaction surrounding Canadian tech salaries that I personally have seen.\n   From taking a look at the average tax rates across all of the jurisdictions, we obtain the surprising result that tax rates tend to be fairly even across all of them for the average software engineer with the notable outliers being Amsterdam and Copenhagen.\n    The cornerstone of this analysis is net incomes. From deducting taxes and cost of living, we can see how much money in USD the average software developer is likely to have. From this, we see that Zurich and Seattle are clearly the top performers in this analysis.\n  This analysis is not perfect as it does not account for how the hiring market differs for different levels of seniority. It also calculates cost of living based on the cost of living downtown so it ignores that one could save money by living further out. It also does not account for culture, equity compensation, bonuses, the availability of jobs within the city itself, and the difficulty of immigration. So, it&#39;s clearly not perfect.

"note_en": "level 2  Around a half second. You can see a real-time video of the pass here:  https://www.instagram.com/p/B_V8-qEpiu7/\n   level 1  This image took quite a bit of planning and preparation to pull off. I frequently check the Transit Finder website to see if there are any good solar transits near me (good meaning the ISS is close to my location so appears larger, and weather is good,) and for the last 3 years there have been none in my area. Until Thursday.\n This image was captured using a special solar telescope, and a dedicated astrophotography camera taking pictures at around 27fps, which was important since the transit only lasted around a half second. In fact, I had also attempted to catch it with a second camera, but the station moved so fast it passed through between frames during my burst shot.  Here is my IG post with more info, including the raw video this image was created from so you can watch how fast it moves.\n To learn more about this image and my work,  come check out my instagram. I go live when i captured events like this to show you the behind-the-scenes.\n level 2  Awesome image as always. How come you had to wait 3 years? I know that the transits are highly localised events, but when I check for them they seem to be pretty common, esp if you drive for 30 or so minutes. Maybe 1 every few months?\n  level 2  are you also this guy?  https://imgur.com/gallery/kAIQdhF because he posted this exact image 2 days before you.\n     level 2  This is awesome, and a well-timed follow-up for me as the space station passed directly overhead a few nights ago. It was a clear night so it looked like an especially bright star. Really quite awe inspiring. \ud83d\ude0c\n  level 2  Is there an option for automatic weekly updates on upcoming transits? Even better to put it into google calendar with notifications. I had the same issue with ISS passes, Iridium flares and Starlink passes - always forget to check the different sites for dates.\n level 2  Just curious, in the video in your first link, why does it repeat it moving?

route to the world\u2019s most remote Costco warehouse.\n The 96-foot ship hummed through the choppy waters of the Icy Strait, past vast expanses of wilderness, snow-capped peaks, and breaching whales. Seven hours later, when it reached Juneau, a few intrepid men loaded its deck with $20k worth of eggs, flour, meat, canned goods, and produce.\n It returned to Gustavus in the twilight haze, like a bird bearing provisions for its chicks.\n Like many of America\u2019s rural and remote towns, Gustavus has an arduous supply chain. Even in good times, getting groceries to an isolated enclave in Southeastern Alaska requires some serious logistical wrangling.\n But when the town\u2019s usual transport methods were disrupted, its 446 residents found themselves in the midst of a pandemic with diminished access to affordable food.\n And one man \u2014 the town grocer \u2014 decided to take matters into his own hands.\n   Situated on a 38-square-mile plain along the Icy Strait, it is a place where moose  outnumber people \u2014 where rugged seascapes meet towering glaciers, hemlock forests, and grassy knolls. It is home to 40 mammal species, 500 varieties of moss, flocks of kittiwakes, and a K-12 school with just 54 students.\n The town had no electricity until 1985, and no phones until the mid-90s. To this day, no roads connect it to the outside world.\n   \u201cYou either gotta fly here or boat here,\u201d says Calvin Casipit, the town\u2019s volunteer mayor. \u201cAnd everybody knows each other in 3 or 4 different ways.\u201d\n Its residents \u2014 a m\u00e9lange of biologists, retirees, and innkeepers \u2014 live on streets named Glen\u2019s Ditch Road and Weedle Fish Drive, and gather once a year for a 4th of July parade featuring slug races and a game called Chicken Poop Bingo.\n As the gateway town to  Glacier Bay National Park, Gustavus is highly dependent on the 3-month summer tourism season, when thousands of travelers book bed &amp; breakfasts, fishing trips, and wildlife tours. But with the park closed until July 1 and much of the world still in lockdown, the local economy is in distress.\n Kimber Owen, who runs the charter boat service  Sea Wolf Adventures, has already suffered from $460k in cancellations. Around town, cooks, bear hunting guides, and park rangers sit dormant. Though certain businesses are now  permitted to reopen in Alaska, many are choosing to stay closed.\n \u201cIn our budgeting for the next year, we\u2019re not counting on a whole lot of sales tax income,\u201d says Casipit. \u201cNobody\u2019s coming.\u201d\n   On a side street on the Western edge of Gustavus, a neon \u201cOPEN\u201d sign shines brightly through the lodgepole pines.\n This weathered wood building is something of a lifeline for the isolated community: Inside, local residents can find fresh produce, meats, canned goods, toilet paper, hardware, lumber, work clothes, pet food, and sporting goods. It\u2019s as if a mini hybrid of Costco and Home Depot were supplanted in the middle of nowhere.\n It\u2019s called Ice Strait Wholesale, but locals have dubbed it Toshco \u2014 a combination of the owner\u2019s name and the chain from which he sources most of his goods.\n  During the health crisis, Toshco has remained in operation, utilizing cones for social distancing (Sean Neilson / Icy Strait Wholesale)\n Toshua Parker, who opened the store 10 years ago, is something of a legend around town: His great-grandfather, Abraham Lincoln Parker, was the area\u2019s first permanent homesteader back in 1917.\n After losing his Arizona-based commercial real estate business in the wake of the Great Recession, Parker, then 30, returned to the town he grew up in.\n At the time, the only way to get groceries was by private barge or plane. This made the local grocery store prohibitively expensive: A gallon of milk that sold for $5 in Juneau cost $12 by the time it arrived in Gustavus, largely due to the logistics of getting it there.\n \u201cThere was just so much margin,\u201d recalls Parker. \u201cAnd I knew there had to be a way to do a better job.\u201d\n Parker did some work around town, scrounged together $3k, and began taking a state-subsidized ferry to Juneau, where he bought Costco inventory to resell in Gustavus at a small markup.\n As the store grew, Parker and his father launched their own  freight company, purchased the town\u2019s gasoline station, and bought two of their own ships \u2014 a $300k \u201cinsurance policy\u201d that gave Parker tighter control over the supply chain in case of an emergency.\n    In the winter of 2019, Alaska legislators cut ferry service to Gustavus. Then, right at the onset of the coronavirus outbreak, the town\u2019s only dock closed for a 4-month repair. The usual fall-back option, an air taxi, charges $0.50/lb for any item it delivers. At that rate, the cost of delivering a gallon of milk would be more than the price of the milk itself.\n \u201cAlaskans are used to being prepared for disruption,\u201d says State Rep. Sara Hannan, who serves Alaska\u2019s 33rd District, which includes Gustavus. \u201cBut this was really a perfect storm of problems.\u201d\n  So, Parker loaded a few shipping crates onto his 96-foot barge and began making weekly pilgrimages across the Icy Strait, to the tiny Costco in Alaska\u2019s state capital.\n  Built in 1993 as an experiment to test smaller markets, the Juneau Costco is the smallest, both in size and scope, of the chain\u2019s 785 warehouses. It may also be one of the most critically important: Many of the isolated small towns in Southeastern Alaska rely on it for food items they otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to get.\n \u201cThe small-market format doesn\u2019t really make sense for us anymore,\u201d Kevin Green, a VP at Costco, told  The Hustle. \u201cIn Juneau, though, it really works.\u201d\n Once per week, Parker takes a tally on what the residents of Gustavus need and makes the 7-hour journey to Juneau to stock up. Gauging demand \u2014 especially in a time of shortages \u2014 is tricky business.\n \u201cIt\u2019s an art form, not a science,\u201d says Parker. \u201cThe town might have a 100-gallon swing in demand for milk from one week to the next without any explanation of why. One week, nobody wants whole milk; the next week, everyone wants 2%.\u201d\n Toshco employees have been on the phone nonstop, taking down special orders from Gustavus residents \u2014 everything from washing machines to baking powder.\n Oftentimes, Parker maxes out on the rations Costco imposes at the store to protect against panic buying.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll place a $20k order, but they\u2019ll still only give us one pack of paper towels,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand why they\u2019d do that, but we\u2019re not a single person panic buying; we\u2019re trying to feed a whole community.\u201d\n  Top: The 7-hour one-way journey from Gustavus to Juneau (The Hustle / Bing Maps); Bottom: The Costco in Juneau, Alaska (Getty Images)\n  \u201cMost grocery stores you go to, you don\u2019t get to see the wholesale cost of what you\u2019re buying \u2014 you don\u2019t know what their margin is,\u201d says Parker. \u201cI can\u2019t mark something up 5x because they know exactly how much something costs at Costco.\u201d\n The average grocery store makes extremely thin margins (~ 2.2%) and makes money by turning over large volumes. Parker says his margins are even thinner \u2014 almost to the point of subsidizing the community \u2014 due to logistics.\n For example, he buys 24-packs of eggs at Costco for $4.50 and sells them in Gustavus for $7.99. That leaves just $3.50 to cover not just the costs of his grocery store (labor, refrigeration, stocking), but the 14-hour freight journey, fuel, loading, and other associated transportation costs.\n  For these things, Toshco uses secret suppliers as far away as Utah. Goods that can\u2019t be found at Costco are carted by truck up to Seattle, then to a freight warehouse in Kent, Washington, before making the journey to Juneau. From there, it\u2019s another 7-hour barge trip to Gustavus.\n \u201cThinking outside of the box [is] the secret to success,\u201d says Parker\u2019s father, Lee. \u201cYou start by brainstorming non-traditional sources \u2014 vendors that most folks may be surprised even have toilet paper in their inventory. Then you get on the phone and start calling everyone around the country until you find a place to buy a pallet.\u00a0 Some of Toshua\u2019s finds are brilliant. And because of that, Toshco has TP when the rest of the world has empty shelves.\u201d\n   The process can take many days \u2014 and one little misstep can impact the entire community of Gustavus.\n Several weeks ago, Parker couldn\u2019t find milk or eggs in Juneau, so he turned to his sources down south. He found a supplier in the lower 48, but by the time it got to Seattle it had missed the barge. The next ship out was a week later.\n Another time, a supplier forgot to include the meat in an order. They paid to send it by plane but bad weather delayed it for 3 days. By the time the meat arrived in Gustavus, it had all expired.\n \u201cYou have to think proactively,\u201d says Parker. \u201cBecause by the time there is a problem, it\u2019s way too late to fix it.\u201d\n  This story isn\u2019t unique to Gustavus: Around the country, rural and remote grocery stores are serving a critically important role for their communities during the coronavirus pandemic.\n David Procter, a professor at Kansas State University and director of its  Rural Grocery Initiative, has spent more than a decade studying the impact of grocery stores in communities with less than 2.5k residents.\n \u201cSmall town grocery stores are having kind of a renaissance because of COVID-19,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone is stuck at home and buying locally.\u201d\n    They serve as economic centers: \u201cWhen someone spends $50 there, they are recirculating their income back into the town.\u201d\n They are typically the main provider of healthy food: \u201cWithout the grocery store, it\u2019s usually convenience stores with processed foods.\u201d\n They are community hubs: \u201cEveryone in town goes there, and they are, sometimes unintentionally, social gathering places.\u201d\n It is not uncommon for individuals like Parker to take things into their own hands when the one grocery store in town goes out of business, says Procter. But what makes Toshco unique is the extreme lengths its owner has gone to, recreating a complex supply chain from scratch to feed an entire town.\n Sean Neilson, a wildlife photography guide and 20-year Gustavus resident, frequents the store for the many eggs his two small children consume.\n \u201cGoing to Toshco to get a gallon of milk might take you 45 minutes,\u201d he says: \u201c4 minutes to drive there, 1 minute to get the milk out of the fridge, and 40 minutes to catch up with someone you bumped into.\u201d\n Justin Marchbanks, the owner of a local construction company, has relied on Parker\u2019s ship to bring in cement and girder beams he uses to build bridges. Ordinarily, he\u2019d have to pay up to $18k to rent out a landing craft for transport; Parker offers the service for a small fraction of that, based on weight.\n \u201cI just don\u2019t even know how he keeps things straight,\u201d Marchbanks says of Parker, who he grew up fishing with. \u201cThey\u2019re dealing with everything the town needs, from pallets full of flour to containers full of hardware. I don\u2019t know how they manage it all.\u201d\n  \u201cToshua pretty much saved the town,\u201d says Casipit. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what we would\u2019ve done without him.\u201d\n   When the barge pulled into Gustavus on a recent Wednesday, it was cause for celebration.\n \u201cIt\u2019s like Christmas when the load gets here,\u201d says Parker. \u201cEveryone is waiting for it. Word gets out, and they all seem to know when it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n This time, the shipment even included  flour \u2014 an item that is scarce in major metropolises with more robust supply networks. When Parker\u2019s parents, now living in Arizona, heard about the haul, they requested a bag by mail.\n \u201cThey can\u2019t get it, but up here we\u2019ve got a couple pallets,\u201d Parker says, with a chuckle. \u201cIn Alaska, we always find a way.\u201d\n Note:  Many of the images in this story were provided by Sean Neilson, a wildlife photography guide who lives in Gustavus.

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  In cryptography, the  dining cryptographers problem studies how to perform a  secure multi-party computation of the boolean-OR function.  David Chaum first proposed this problem in the early 1980s and used it as an illustrative example to show that it was possible to send anonymous messages with unconditional sender and recipient untraceability. Anonymous communication networks based on this problem are often referred to as  DC-nets(where DC stands for &#34;dining  ...\n Despite the word  dining, the dining cryptographers problem is unrelated to the  dining philosophers problem.\n    Three cryptographers gather around a table for dinner. The waiter informs them that the meal has been paid for by someone, who could be one of the cryptographers or the  National Security Agency (NSA). The cryptographers respect each other&#39;s right to make an anonymous payment, but want to find out whether the NSA paid. So they decide to execute a two-stage protocol.\n In the first stage, every two cryptographers establish a shared one-bit secret, say by tossing a coin behind a menu so that only two cryptographers see the outcome in turn for each two cryptographers. Suppose, for example, that after the coin tossing, cryptographer A and B share a secret bit            1    {\\displaystyle 1}  , A and C share            0    {\\displaystyle 0}  , and B and C share            1    {\\displaystyle 1}  .\n  if they didn&#39;t pay for the meal, the  exclusive OR (XOR) of the two shared bits they hold with their two neighbours,\n Supposing none of the cryptographers paid, then A announces            1  \u2295  0  =  1    {\\displaystyle 1\\oplus 0=1}  , B announces            1  \u2295  1  =  0    {\\displaystyle 1\\oplus 1=0}  , and C announces            0  \u2295  1  =  1    {\\displaystyle 0\\oplus 1=1}  . On the other hand, if A paid, she announces            \u00ac  (  1  \u2295  0  )  =  0    {\\displaystyle \\lnot (1\\oplus 0)=0}  .\n The three public announcements combined reveal the answer to their question. One simply computes the XOR of the three bits announced. If the result is 0, it implies that none of the cryptographers paid (so the NSA must have paid the bill). Otherwise, one of the cryptographers paid, but their identity remains unknown to the other cryptographers.\n   The DC-net protocol is simple and elegant. It has several limitations, however, some solutions to which have been explored in follow-up research (see the References section below).\n If two cryptographers paid for the dinner, their messages will cancel each other out, and the final XOR result will be            0    {\\displaystyle 0}  . This is called a collision and allows only one participant to transmit at a time using this protocol. In a more general case, a collision happens as long as any even number of participants send messages.\n Any malicious cryptographer who does not want the group to communicate successfully can jam the protocol so that the final XOR result is useless, simply by sending random bits instead of the correct result of the XOR. This problem occurs because the original protocol was designed without using any  public key technology and lacks reliable mechanisms to check whether participants honestly follow the protocol.  [1]\n The protocol requires pairwise shared secret keys between the participants, which may be problematic if there are many participants. Also, though the DC-net protocol is &#34;unconditionally secure&#34;, it actually depends on the assumption that &#34;unconditionally secure&#34; channels already exist between pairs of the participants, which is not easy to achieve in practice.\n A related  anonymous veto network algorithm computes the logical OR of several users&#39; inputs, rather than a logical XOR as in DC-nets, which may be useful in applications to which a logical OR combining operation is naturally suited.\n  David Chaum first thought about this problem in the early 1980s. The first publication that outlines the basic underlying ideas is his.  [2] The journal version appeared in the very first issue of the Journal of Cryptology.  [3]\n  DC-nets are readily generalized to allow for transmissions of more than one bit per round, for groups larger than three participants, and for arbitrary &#34;alphabets&#34; other than the binary digits 0 and 1, as described below.\n  To enable an anonymous sender to transmit more than one bit of information per DC-nets round, the group of cryptographers can simply repeat the protocol as many times as desired to create a desired number of bits worth of transmission bandwidth. These repetitions need not be performed serially. In practical DC-net systems, it is typical for pairs of participants to agree up-front on a single shared &#34;master&#34; secret, using  Diffie \u2013Hellman  ...\n  The protocol can be generalized to a group of            n    {\\displaystyle n}   participants, each with a shared secret key in common with each other participant. In each round of the protocol, if a participant wants to transmit an untraceable message to the group, they invert their publicly announced bit. The participants can be visualized as a  fully connected graphwith the vertices representing the participants and the edges representing  ...\n  The protocol may be run with less than fully connected secret sharing graphs, which can improve the performance and scalability of practical DC-net implementations, at the potential risk of reducing anonymity if colluding participants can split the secret sharing graph into separate connected components. For example, an intuitively appealing but less secure generalization to            n  &gt;  3    {\\displaystyle n&gt;3}  participants using  ...\n Another compromise secret sharing DC-net topology, employed in the  Dissent system for scalability,  [4] may be described as a  client/server or  user/trustee topology. In this variant, we assume there are two types of participants playing different roles: a potentially large number  n of users who desire anonymity, and a much smaller number            m    {\\displaystyle m}   of  trusteeswhose role is to help the users obtain that anonymity. In  ...\n  Though the simple DC-nets protocol uses  binary digits as its transmission alphabet, and uses the XOR operator to combine cipher texts, the basic protocol generalizes to any alphabet and combining operator suitable for  one-time padencryption. This flexibility arises naturally from the fact that the secrets shared between the many pairs of participants are, in effect, merely one-time pads combined together symmetrically within a single DC-net  ...\n One useful alternate choice of DC-nets alphabet and combining operator is to use a  finite group suitable for public-key cryptography as the alphabet\u2014such as a  Schnorr group or  elliptic curve\u2014and to use the associated group operator as the DC-net combining operator. Such a choice of alphabet and operator makes it possible for clients to use  zero-knowledge prooftechniques to prove correctness properties about the DC-net ciphertexts that  ...\n  The measure originally suggested by David Chaum to avoid collisions is to retransmit the message once a collision is detected, but the paper does not explain exactly how to arrange the retransmission.\n Dissent avoids the possibility of unintentional collisions by using a verifiable shuffle to establish a DC-nets transmission schedule, such that each participant knows exactly which bits in the schedule correspond to his own transmission slot, but does not know who owns other transmission slots.  [8]\n  Herbivore divides a large anonymity network into smaller DC-net groups, enabling participants to evade disruption attempts by leaving a disrupted group and joining another group, until the participant finds a group free of disruptors.  [9] This evasion approach introduces the risk that an adversary who owns many nodes could  selectively disrupt only groups the adversary has not  completelycompromised, thereby &#34;herding&#34; participants  ...\n Dissent implements several schemes to counter disruption. The original protocol  [8] used a verifiable  cryptographic shuffle to form a DC-net transmission schedule and distribute &#34;transmission assignments&#34;, allowing the correctness of subsequent DC-nets ciphertexts to be verified with a simple  cryptographic hashcheck. This technique required a fresh verifiable before every DC-nets round, however, leading to high latencies.
