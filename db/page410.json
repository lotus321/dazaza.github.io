OFFclaims to have been created with the expressed intention &#34;to cut off some gangrene-infested  ...\n   OFF development started within the  hacktivism group  The Big Hack in 2003 by the  hackers Cheater512, CaptainMorgan, Aqlo and WhiteRaven. In 2004, a rudimentary version was finished, written in PHP, which was distributed as two demo CDs. Following these, SpectralMorning re-implemented the functionality in 2004 in  C++, which led to the current &#34;mainline&#34;  OFF client.\n On August 14, 2006, CaptainMorgan posted a letter of &#34;closing&#34; addressed to the &#34;Copyright Industry Associations of America&#34;, such as the  RIAA and  MPAA, stating that they have created  OFF with the purpose of ending &#34;all of your problems with consumer copyright infringement.&#34;  [2]\n Today we announce a massively distributed copy-less file system. A place where all content is available instantly, anonymously and to everyone, without breaking any laws. Today we announce the Owner-Free File System. An island of sanity in your sea of madness.\n In 2008, the network consisted of around 50  nodes. On April 11, 2008, a beta test was held  [3] with a network size of over 100 nodes. Since SpectralMorning stopped work on  OFF in late 2008, only minor  bug fix releases were made to mainline  OFF.\n Starting from 2007, an alternative, but compatible client was developed, called BlocksNet. Written in  Ruby and well-maintained, it saw major improvements over recent time. It has been under development until 2011.  [4]\n The client OFFLoad is a  fork from mainline  OFF, which seemingly adds no features. Reasons for the fork are unclear. Another distantly related program is  Monolith, which uses a similar principle to  OFF. It was created after  OFF and features no multi-use of blocks and no networking.\n  The  OFF System is a kind of anonymous, fully decentralized P2P file sharing program and network. In contrast to other anonymous file sharing networks, which derive their anonymity from forwarding their data blocks via intermediate network nodes,  OFF derives its anonymity from anonymizing the data files.  [5] Thus, the system refers to itself as a  brightnet to contrast its method of operation with that of private file sharing systems known as  darknets  ...\n  In order to store a file into the local OFF storage, resp.  block cache, choose the tuple size            t    {\\displaystyle t}   (default 3), split the source file            s    {\\displaystyle s}   into blocks              s    i      {\\displaystyle s_{i}}   of size 128 KiB (pad with random data to fit) and for each, do the following:\n Select            t  \u2212  1    {\\displaystyle t-1}   blocks for use as randomizer blocks, or for short,  randomizers, from the existing OFF cache, which have not been used in previous iterations. If not enough randomizers exist in the cache, generate them using a random number generator.\n Calculate              o    i    =    s    i    \u2295    r    1    \u2295    r    2    \u2295  .  .  .  \u2295    r    t  \u2212  1      {\\displaystyle o_{i}=s_{i}\\oplus r_{1}\\oplus r_{2}\\oplus ...\\oplus r_{t-1}}   and store the resulting block              o    i      {\\displaystyle o_{i}}   in the cache,            \u2295    {\\displaystyle \\oplus }   being the  XOR operation.\n Update the  descriptor list, which contains the information on how to restore each source block              s    i      {\\displaystyle s_{i}}  , with a new entry, which is a set of size            t    {\\displaystyle t}  :            {    o    i    ,    r    1    ,    r    2    .  .  .    r    t  \u2212  1    }    {\\displaystyle \\{o_{i},r_{1},r_{2}...r_{t-1}\\}}  .\n Finally, store the  descriptor list in its own block (or blocks, if the list is larger than 128 KiB) and insert these blocks              d    i      {\\displaystyle d_{i}}   into the block cache and generate an  OFF URL for referencing the source file and output it to the user or into the local  OFF URL database.\n  To retrieve, obtain the descriptor block or blocks and for each contained set of size            t    {\\displaystyle t}  , do the following:\n Obtain the listed blocks              b    1    ,    b    2    .  .  .    b    t      {\\displaystyle b_{1},b_{2}...b_{t}}  . Though they have no identity any more at this point, they could be called              o    i    ,    r    1    ,    r    2    .  .  .    r    t  \u2212  1      {\\displaystyle o_{i},r_{1},r_{2}...r_{t-1}}  .\n Perform              s    i    =    b    1    \u2295    b    2    \u2295  .  .  .  \u2295    b    t      {\\displaystyle s_{i}=b_{1}\\oplus b_{2}\\oplus ...\\oplus b_{t}}   and output the resulting source data block              s    i      {\\displaystyle s_{i}}   to a viewer program or to storage.\n   No source file content is stored in the block cache, only blocks that consist of probably random data.\n   (No block in the cache is copyrightable by itself, because numbers - however large - cannot be subject to copyright (and neither would be small parts of a copyrighted work).)\n The original uploader remains unknown, because blocks are dispersed into the network and therefore downloading is done from multiple sources.\n During disperse, the usage of the block cannot be stated, because blocks are re-used in other contexts to re-assemble other source file blocks. (TODO that is true also for retrieve)\n (No block can be copyrighted without logical contradictions, because blocks used for re-assembling a source file block are re-used for re-assembly of other source file blocks. It is undecidable who would have copyright on a block, which has several meanings. Everyone would have copyright on everything.)\n If the  OFF-internal search function is used, search terms are untraceable to its originator, because the search request is forwarded to the next node and its results back to that node instead of directly to the originator. It is thus not possible to decide whether a node is the originating node or a node doing a search request on behalf of another node.\n  Because  OFF anonymizes the data blocks being exchanged instead of the network, no forwarding via intermediate nodes is required. Therefore, this method has a higher degree of efficiency than traditional, forwarding-based anonymous P2P systems.\n The forwarding method requires that a data block is uploaded and downloaded several times before it reaches its destination, which happens between 5 and 15 times.,  [6] which, according to the resulting formula            s  \u2217  (  h  i  +  h  o  +  1  )  \u2217  2  \u2212  s    {\\displaystyle s*(hi+ho+1)*2-s}  , is equivalent to an overhead of 900 to 2900%, while the overhead of  OFF without optimizations is about 200%. (           s    {\\displaystyle s}\n  Re-use some of the result blocks              o    i      {\\displaystyle o_{i}}   and  randomizer blocks, which reduces the overhead to            s  \u2217  (  t  \u2212  1  )  \u2217      e  100      {\\displaystyle s*(t-1)*{\\frac {e}{100}}}  ,  [7] where            s    {\\displaystyle s}   is the source file size,            t    {\\displaystyle t}   the tuple size and            e    {\\displaystyle e}  the percentage of unrelated blocks used in the randomizing  ...\n If some of the blocks required to fully retrieve, resp. re-assemble, the source file are already present in the block cache from other transfers or stored files because of the multi-use nature of  OFF blocks, the degree of efficiency is increased further.\n Use of the  targeted store feature leads to the blocks of specific other files to be chosen as randomizers for this file with higher probability and therefore a reduction in overhead. This is especially useful when storing a group of related files.\n    ^    &#34;Archived copy&#34;. Archived from  the original on 2011-07-20 .

t", "note_en": "The coronavirus pandemic has sped up a revolution in home working, leaving offices around the world empty. But what was the point of them anyway?\n    In the spring of 1822 an employee in one of the world \u2019s first offices \u2013that of the East India Company in London \u2013sat down to write a letter to a friend. If the man was excited to be working in a building that was revolutionary, or thrilled to be part of a novel institution which would transform the world in the centuries that followed, he showed little sign of it. \u201cYou don \u2019t know how wearisome it is \u201d, wrote Charles Lamb, \u201cto breathe the air of four pent walls, without relief, day after  ...\n The world that Lamb wrote from is now long gone. The infamous East India Company collapsed in ignominy in the 1850s. Its most famous legacy, British colonial rule in India, disintegrated a century later. But his letter resonates today, because, while other empires have fallen, the empire of the office has triumphed over modern professional life.\n The dimensions of this empire are awesome. Its population runs into hundreds of millions, drawn from every nation on Earth. It dominates the skylines of our cities \u2013their tallest buildings are no longer cathedrals or temples but multi-storey vats filled with workers. It delineates much of our lives. If you are a hardworking citizen of this empire you will spend more waking hours with the irritating colleague to your left whose spare shoes invade your footwell than with your husband or wife,  ...\n Or rather you used to. This spring, almost overnight, the world\u2019s offices emptied. In New York and Paris, in Madrid and Milan, they ready themselves for commuters who never come. Empty lifts slide up and down announcing floor numbers to empty vestibules; water coolers hum and gurgle, cooling water that no one will drink. For the moment, office life is over.\n Even before coronavirus struck, the reign of the office had started to look a little shaky. A combination of rising rents, the digital revolution and increased demands for flexible working meant its population was slowly emigrating to different milieux. More than half of the Ameri\u00adcan workforce already worked remotely, at least some of the time. Across the world, home working had been rising steadily for a decade. Pundits predicted that it would increase further. No one imagined that a  ...\n It\u2019s too early to say whether the office is done for. As with any sudden loss, many of us find our judgment blurred by conflicting emotions. Relief at freedom from the daily commute and pleasure at turning one\u2019s back on what Philip Larkin called \u201cthe toad work\u201d are tinged with regret and nostalgia, as we prepare for another shapeless day of   in jogging bottoms.\n But we shouldn \u2019t let sentimentality cloud us. Offices have always been profoundly flawed spaces. Those of the East India Company, among the world \u2019s first, were built more for bombast than bureaucracy. They were sermons in stone, and the solidity of every marble step, the elegance of every Palladian pillar, were intended to speak volumes about the profitability and smooth functioning within. This was nonsense, of course. Created to ensure efficiency, offices immediately institutionalised  ...\n The first offices belonged to governments or quasi-government bodies like the East India Company. Running a country, let alone an empire, requires a lot of paper to be pushed and governing proved simpler when all those functionaries were in one place. But it was the Industrial Revolution that really changed things. Coal, steel and steam started to spin the wheels of the English textile industry ever faster and railways unspooled across the countryside. The new steam trains shuttled  ...\n The most transformatory aspect of offices was less the buildings themselves than the sheer amount of time we spent in them. This would have seemed alien to many earlier societies. Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge University, notes that elite Romans strived to switch off as much as possible. \u201cOur division between leisure and work is reversed in the Roman world. What we mostly do is work and, when we \u2019re not working, we \u2019re at leisure. \u201dIn Rome it was the other way round  ...\n Romans didn \u2019t have to go to a special place to work. Their tablets and styluses were every bit as portable as our own, a feature that elite Romans took full advantage of. Two thousand years ago Pliny the Younger, an author and lawyer, wrote a letter to his friend Tacitus. He had found, he said, a splendid new method of working. Instead of going about his business at a desk, he had decided that day to combine it with a boar hunt. He sat next to his nets \u201cnot with boar spear or  ...\n Few office workers have been indulged to this extent. In the 20th century, the people who had once designed factories turned their attention to offices. The moving parts in these machines were humans and their output merely paper but, it was reasoned, the same principles surely applied. In America teams armed with stopwatches, and a firm belief that a well-oiled office was a wonderful thing, recorded how long each task took. Anything that added extra tick-tocks of time received  ...\n When time-and-motion studies examine offices today, their results can be dispiriting. Office-work takes up not merely the bulk of our time but the best part of it, the hours when we are alert and alive. Home, and its occupants, has the husk. Most managers spend at least 20 hours a week in meetings, according to a study by Bain &amp; Company in 2014. Over the course of a lifetime that amounts to nearly five full years. Many of these meetings, in wistful retrospect, might have  ...\n But getting work done has never really been the point of offices. In 2004 Corinne Maier, a French psychoanalyst who at the time was working at  , the French electrical giant, published a book called \u201cBonjour paresse \u201d, or \u201cHello Laziness \u201d. The critique of corporate culture became an instant international bestseller. Maier argues that, far from aiding efficiency, offices are \u201cuseless \u201dsince workers \u201close a lot of time going to meetings and speaking the jargon and doing in fact  ...\n Maier might have become a bestseller but on the whole writing about offices is not \u2013at least in the West \u2013an instant route to stardom. Lamb \u2019s letters are typical. His correspondent for that first, springtime letter was William Wordsworth, the great Romantic poet, who filled his days with walks in the Lake District and his pages with dancing daffodils. Lamb, by contrast, filled his days in London \u2019s financial district and his pages with the price of tea. Though Lamb \u2019s is the  ...\n It \u2019s not just poetry but fiction that tends to ignore the office (China, where top-selling novelists write books with such thrilling titles as \u201cThe Civil Servant \u2019s Notebook \u201d, is a rare exception). Though great writers have tackled the subject, including Balzac, Dickens, Flaubert, Melville and Kafka, they do so more in satire than celebration. Joshua Ferris, an American novelist, won literary plaudits for \u201cThen We Came to the End \u201d, a novel that sustained a narrative in  ...\n Poets have been even more scathing. John Betjeman wished for bombs to fall and \u201cblow to smithereens/Those air-conditioned, bright canteens\u201d. In \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d, T.S. Eliot (who had once worked in Lloyds Bank) saw the crowds of commuters crossing London Bridge in terms of Dante\u2019s vision of hell: \u201cI had not thought death had undone so many.\u201d Walt Whitman sneered at clerks as men \u201cof minute leg, chalky face and hollow chest\u201d.\n There is more than a dash of superiority in such attacks, but there are good reasons to be critical of offices. Many of the more recent examples are aesthetic embarrassments. Where Ancient Rome had the Colosseum, Renaissance Florence had Brunelleschi \u2019s dome and Byzantium had the Hagia Sophia, we have endless, interchangeable glass-and-steel boxes. This, says Thomas Heatherwick, a British architect, is because the design of offices \u2013indeed all public buildings \u2013has been  ...\n  Like a dad at the disco, the office has been trying to do this for a while. Daring architects have broken the mould to construct buildings in the shape of gherkins, cheese graters and walkie talkies \u2013and that \u2019s just in London. To change the stale spaces inside, startups introduced ping-pong tables and ball pits ( \u201cdumb fun \u201d, sniffs Heatherwick). Then they offered free food in an attempt to keep workers perpetually in their embrace. Who needs to go home for dinner, when your company  ...\n Offices can be not just offensive to the eye but harmful to the body. Sitting isn \u2019t quite the new smoking, but it certainly won \u2019t do you any good. A life lived on one \u2019s bottom increases the risk of heart disease, type-2 diabetes, some cancers and all manner of back problems. Offices also entrench social inequalities. The top dog is more likely to hire in his own image, perpetuating male privilege. In 2018 there were more men called Steve than there were women among the chief  ...\n The office has further-reaching patriarchal ploys up its sleeve. Chief among these is its response to children. Or rather lack of it. For most of history, workplaces ignored children entirely (the run on deposits precipitated by the arrival of the Banks twins at their father \u2019s place of work in \u201cMary Poppins \u201dshows the dire consequences of offspring turning up at the office). The Angel in the House, as Victorians fondly referred to their wives, was assumed to handle all that.  ...\n The office \u2019s ongoing indifference to children has resulted in the social phenomenon that Emily Oster, professor of economics at Brown University and author of \u201cCribsheet \u201d, a data-led guide to raising kids, calls \u201csecret parenting \u201d. Parents strive to keep up the old pretence that children don \u2019t exist, deploying techniques that range from not putting up pictures of one \u2019s children at work, to pretending that they themselves are ill so that they can care for genuinely sick infants  ...\n Despite the commute and the colleagues, the sitting and the stale meetings, offices bring many of us something else too: joy. Lucy Kellaway, who wrote a long-running column in the  Financial Timeson the absurdities of office life, talks of the \u201cgreat artificiality \u201dwe embrace the moment that we step into an office. \u201cWe pretend that our clothes are always in order and that we are entirely professional and impersonal. Whereas probably in our heads and definitely in our homes there  ...\n And what a wonderful thing that artifice can be. Now that we are all working from home, amid the children, the toast crumbs and the laundry, we are realising that the pretence of an orderly life at the office is also a liberation. It allows each day to have its own architecture, its rhythms of departure and arrival. Putting on a perfectly ironed silk shirt or a crisp suit and leaving the house may be contrived but it is also, says Kellaway, \u201cone of the beauties of working life...It  ...\n And so, for all the threat faced by the office, there is also cause for optimism about its future. These days the \u201chyper-physical\u2026is so cherished,\u201d notes Heatherwick. Sales of records are at their highest in years, book covers have rarely looked so beautiful. Though many of us might have been loth to admit it until this spring, all those desks and all those people, all that bustle and time-wasting, have their benefits.\n Humans need offices. Online encounters may be keeping us alive as social beings right now, but work-related video meetings are too often transactional, awkward and unappealing. After the initial joy of peering into each other \u2019s houses on Zoom, we are confronted with people \u2019s heads looming even closer than we see them across the desk at work, and we gaze in horror \u2013half of it self-awareness that we, too, must look awful \u2013at thinning hair and double chins. We become freakish  ...\n For all his grumbling, Charles Lamb believed something similar too. When Wordsworth seems to have grown a trifle too smug about the sublime joys of the natural world, Lamb snapped back. \u201cI don\u2019t much care if I never see a mountain in my life.\u201d But he did care for the city and he certainly loved offices. All his complaints were, he wrote, mere \u201clovers\u2019 quarrels\u201d. Above all, he loved his desk.

"note_en": "One of the many challenges of being stuck at home during this pandemic is not knowing the best ways to help the local businesses we love and depend on. Take, well, takeout: We\u2019ve been instructed to order takeout and delivery from our favorite restaurants\u2014especially smaller, family-owned businesses\u2014to ensure they are bringing in at least some income while their dining rooms are closed during this period of physical distancing. And while this is a great plan, the degree to which you \u2019re helping them  ...\n   Over the past several years, many of us have gotten in the habit of ordering food through third-party delivery appslike GrubHub, Seamless or Caviar. And over the past few weeks, you \u2019ve likely received a steady stream of emails from these companies, trying to lure us in with promotions like \u201cSupport for Supper, \u201dwhere GrubHub users get additional discounts for ordering food from local restaurants during certain hours. On the surface, this seems like a great idea: keeping your favorite restaurants  ...\n   There\u2019s no ethical consumption under capitalism\u2014even gummy bears aren\u2019t safe\u2014but I\u2019d like to think\u2026\n Read more\n But not so fast: As it turns out, these discounts are coming out of the  restaurants\u2019 profits, and are certainly not the altruistic acts that third-party apps want you to believe they are.\n  Let\u2019s take a look at some numbers. Susie Cagle, a reporter at The Guardian,   recently tweeted a GrubHub invoice from Chicago Pizza Boss, breaking down exactly where your money is going when you use the third-party app and take advantage of its promotions. (Spoiler: it\u2019s not to the restaurants.)\n    Unfortunately, this is not a new situation:   We\u2019ve been writing about how   ordering food through third-party apps is   harming local restaurants for a while. The difference is that now people are ordering delivery more than ever before,  and may be doing so under the mistaken perception that they are helping a business stay afloat, unaware of the apps\u2019 shady practices. On top of that, restaurants are no longer able to offer table service at all, and withdelivery and takeout comprising 100 percent  ...\n For example, as   Baba\u2019s Pierogies in Brooklyn   recently explained in an Instagram post that the restaurant has spent more than $20,000 in third-party platform percentage fees since January 1, 2020. So why did they join in the first place? They explain that, too:\n We didn \u2019t have a choice, we caved. Revenue from these platforms made a difference for our business and I \u2019m certain does for many other NYC businesses. Like other fellow businesses, we never liked the partnership but went along with it. Now, during this crisis which is really holding the industry hostage to 3rd party platforms, we are even more aware of the amount of money that we get withdrawn from our account just to have our name on their site. We make the food AND deliver the food. Seems  ...\n   Yes, this is all pretty grim\u2014especially if you thought you were genuinely doing the right thing by ordering through these third-party apps\u2014but there is something you can do to help.\n  We\u2019ve said it before and we\u2019ll say it again: Pick up the phone the next time you decide to place a\u2026\n Read more\n  By ordering food directly from the restaurant, you\u2019re guaranteeing that they\u2019re the ones who profit from the sale. Remember back when everyone had a drawer in their kitchen stuffed with takeout menus alongside the other assorted junk like pens, tape and rubber bands? Well, it\u2019s time to resurrect the menu drawer\u2014at least in some form.\n  But can\u2019t you just pull up GrubHub to peruse the menu and find a phone number to call and order your food? While that sounds great in theory, in practice,   third-party sites may list their own phone numbers for the restaurant\u2014meaning that if you call to place an order, it\u2019s still going through their platform. The app uses this as a justification to take a commission, even though your order didn\u2019t come through their website or app, because it \u201cproves\u201d the transaction originated there.\n That\u2019s where good old-fashioned paper menus\u2014or at least going directly to a restaurant\u2019s own website\u2014come in. This allows you to completely cut out the middleman and ensure that your beloved local eatery is getting the maximum profits possible from your order.\n  In the   same Instagram post, Baba\u2019s Pierogies announced that they have set up a link on their website that allows customers to order directly from them for delivery or pickup. It also allows you to pay online, so the takeout/delivery remains contactless. Other restaurants have done the same thing, so   check to see if that\u2019s an option before you order.\n When you\u2019re ordering food online, it\u2019s all too easy to just add a couple of dollars online as a\u2026\n Read more\n  And if you\u2019re not a fan of clutter or having paper menus sitting around, just snap a photo of the menu and store it on your phone or in a special folder on your computer. The bottom line is to put in the tiny amount of extra effort it takes to order directly from the business you are trying to support. It may mean the difference between them staying open and\u00a0going under before you\u2019re able to dine there in person again.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:03:16", "tags": "\u9910\u5385,order",

I wondered if the data was freely available.  It was. I rubbed my hands and got to work. An hour later, I have this (explanations and how-to follows).\n   The X-axis represents the size of the clean (i.e. no comments, normalized white space) GZip \u2019d program source code, in bytes. The Y-axis represents performance, as measured by CPU time - the lower, the better. The dots are all the data points for all the benchmarks for all the languages in the Benchmarks Game dataset. In each subplot, are the language specific plots. Each red line is a line from the mean (X, Y) to a data point of the given language. The specific subset of programming languages  ...\n This chart shows the balance between the verbosity of a program written in a language, and the runtime performance of it. The ideal programming language would sit at the lower left quadrant. You may have noticed I left one of my favourite languages, Python, out. This is because I had truncated the chart at the given maximum X and Ys. Such a plot for Python would show no red line. I replaced it with Swift.\n The density of lines show how many programs are being considered. In the dataset, multiple implementations are considered for each benchmark for each language. For the image above, I considered only the highest performing benchmarks for each language benchmark. Here\u2019s one without filtering only the best:\n  The area is essentially the variance. I had originally wanted to also plot the polygon connecting them. But I reasoned that the human mind is not good at understanding areas, so decided against it.\n What\u2019s the point of these charts? Well, for one, it allows me to play the amateur taxonomist. It is by no means formal, but now I can quantify the species of programming languages by the shape of their size-performance plot. It allows for the following observations to be made.\n  Go is for Buddhists who like \u201cThe Middle Way \u201d. It is really average. By sheer chance I left it at the middle of the plot. Rust shares the performance characteristics of C, but is more verbose. The biggest surprise is the functional languages, OCaml, and Haskell. For a language famed for its terseness, Haskell it turns out, isn \u2019t as terse as expected - it \u2019s average size of source code is larger than the average Go source code size. Ocaml on the other hand was the dark horse. It \u2019s about  ...\n Julia was rather surprising in several aspects: Julia is a lisp. So its terseness is expected. Julia uses LLVM, which has crazy amazing backend optimization. Which is why its lower performance is somewhat surprising. However, using a median aggregate measure, Julia looks more as expected.\n  To the surprise to absolutely no one who reads this blog frequently (hello to the two of you), I wrote it in Go. I used Gonum\u2019s  plot library to generate the plots. The full souce code can be found  here\n The program does warrant some explanations. There are no  plot.Plotter for drawing the lines, so I had to write that from scratch. These are the relevant lines:\n // star is a data structure used for plotting line starstype star struct {\tplotter.XYs\tdraw.LineStyle\tmx, my float64\ttrx, try float64 // truncate at}func (s *star) Plot(c draw.Canvas, p *plot.Plot) {\ttx, ty := p.Transforms(&amp;c)\ttrx, try := tx(s.trx), ty(s.try)\tls := s.LineStyle\tmx, my := tx(s.mx), ty(s.my)\tfor _, xy := range s.XYs {\t\tx := tx(xy.X)\t\ty := ty(xy.Y)\t\tif x &gt; trx {\t\t\tx = trx\t\t}\t\tif y &gt; try {\t\t\ty = try\t\t}\t\tc.StrokeLine2(ls, mx, my, x, y)\t}}\n I didn\u2019t quite remember how to do this. But thankfully I had written  a book on how to plot with custom Gonum plotters, so I could just refer to it . If you want full explanations, buy the book, or ask me nicely  * As part of my marketing contract requirement, I am required to write an article about my book. The experience of writing a book had been more rushed than expected, and if asked, I will say &#34;I could have done better&#34;. So I shall subvert this article for the aforementioned  ...\n Further, to tile the plots, I made use of Gorgonia\u2019s  tensor package, which provides truly generic multidimensional arrays. It\u2019s not strictly necessary for 3x3 plots, but it was a quick and easy way to do things for me:\n t := tensor.New(tensor.WithBacking(ps), tensor.WithShape(len(list)/cols, cols))\tmatUgh, err := native.Matrix(t)\tdieIfErr(err)\tmat := matUgh.([][]*plot.Plot)\ttiles := draw.Tiles{Rows: t.Shape()[0], Cols: t.Shape()[1]}\n I do definitely think the tiling function could have been more neatly written. But it is what it is. Old mate  Sebastien Binet from  Go-HEP suggests using the  TiledPlot data structure from  hplot. I concur with the suggestion.\n  I set out to visualize the space of aggregates in neural networks. I got sidetracked and plotted some charts about programming languages as an attempt to quantify them in some way. Came into some probably spurious conclusions. Go is pretty average.\n There is somewhere, an irony - this is that I have now taken more time to write this blog post than to write the program. I\u2019d like to hear what you think.\n  In a case of not-doing-your-research-before-blabbing, Isaac Gouy, current maintainer of the Computer Language Benchmarks Game mentions in the comments below that something similar had been done by  Guillaume Marceau almost a decade ago. Guillaume even has the whole quadrant thing set up and properly explained. Do note that if you want to compare my results with Guillaume\u2019s, the axes are flipped on Guillaume\u2019s\n Additionally, the post above have been corrected to include a note that the source code size is GZip\u2019d.

oximeter, a lifesaving device that clips on a finger and shows the level of oxygen in the blood and that has become a critical tool in the fight against the novel coronavirus, died on April 18 in Tokyo. He was 84.\n His death, in a hospital, was  announced by his employer, Nihon Khoden, a Tokyo-based company that makes medical equipment. A niece, Kyoko Aoyagi, confirmed the death but said she did not know the cause.\n The pulse oximeter has become \u201can indispensable addition to medicine,\u201d said V. Courtney Broaddus, a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Historically, patients were measured by four vital signs: temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate. \u201cIt has become the fifth vital sign,\u201d she said of oxygen level.\n While many coronavirus patients do feel chest pain, fever and other symptoms, Dr. Broaddus said, the pulse oximeter \u201chas become especially important because humans do not sense a low oxygen saturation alone.\u201d\n Moreover, some Covid patients seem not to have other symptoms. As a result, when moderately or mildly ill patients test positive for the coronavirus, they may be sent home with a pulse oximeter so that they can  track their oxygen level and return to the hospital if it drops.\n  Mr. Aoyagi\u2019s contribution to medical science was built on decades of innovation and invention. In an  essay about Mr. Aoyagi, John W. Severinghaus, a professor emeritus of anesthesia at the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in 2007 that Mr. Aoyagi\u2019s \u201cdream\u201d had been to detect oxygen saturation levels without having to draw blood.\n His early research tried to measure cardiac output (the amount of blood the heart pumps), using a method known as  dye dilution, which involves injecting a patient with dye. Instead of withdrawing the blood downstream and measuring the concentration of dye, he attempted instead to use early oximeters, some of which were developed during World War II to help military pilots breathe at high altitudes.\n  Those early devices, which clamped to the ear, tended to be inaccurate, unreliable and cumbersome, but Mr. Aoyagi was fascinated by the underlying technology: using two wavelengths of light \u2014 red and infrared \u2014 to measure blood oxygen levels. (Hemoglobin, the protein in blood that transports oxygen, absorbs light differently when it binds with oxygen.)\n But he soon ran into a problem. Blood does not flow smoothly like an open tap, but pulses through the body irregularly, thus preventing an accurate recording of dye levels. The problem, however, turned out to be an opportunity. By devising a mathematical formula to cancel out this \u201cpulsatile noise,\u201d he created a device that measured oxygen levels with greater accuracy than before.\n \u201cGreatness in science, often, as here, comes from the well-prepared mind turning a chance observation into a major discovery,\u201d Dr. Severinghaus wrote.\n Nihon Kohden applied for a Japanese patent for its pulse oximeter in 1974, with Mr. Aoyagi and a colleague, Michio Kishi, listed as inventors. It was granted in 1979.\n While many companies sell oximeters today, \u201call of today\u2019s pulse oximeters are based on Dr. Aoyagi\u2019s original principles of pulse oximetry,\u201d according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which  awarded Mr. Aoyagi its IEEE medal for innovations in health care technology in 2015. He was the first Japanese person to receive the award.\n  Takuo Aoyagi was born Feb. 14, 1936, in Niigata Prefecture, on the west coast of Japan, to Monshichi and Tatsu Aoyagi. His father was a math teacher, his mother a homemaker. He graduated from Niigata University in 1958 with a degree in electrical engineering and worked for Shimadzu before joining Nihon Khoden in 1971.\n He earned a doctorate in engineering from the University of Tokyo in 1993. Other honors include the  JS Gravenstein Award from the Society for Technology in Anesthesia  in 2013. In 2002, he received a Medal With Purple Ribbon from the Emperor of Japan, given in recognition of achievements in the arts and academics.\n   If you\u2019ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n  This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on  how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \u201cHow will we know when to reopen the country?\u201d In  an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson  staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs  ...\n  The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts  donations here.  Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the  American Red Cross, and  World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related  GoFundMe fund-raisershave started  ...\n  The C.D.C. has  recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting  new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don \u2019t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they  ...\n  If you\u2019re sick and you think you\u2019ve been exposed to the new coronavirus,  the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there\u2019s a chance \u2014 because of a lack of testing kits or because you\u2019re asymptomatic, for instance \u2014 you won\u2019t be able to get tested.\n  It seems to spread  very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n  No.  Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n  Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and  little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions \u2014 not just those with respiratory diseases \u2014 particularly hard.\n  If the family member doesn\u2019t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible,  according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C.If there \u2019s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not  ...\n  Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves,  the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n  Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don\u2019t live in your home.  Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n  That\u2019s not a good idea. Even if you\u2019re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year\u2019s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n  Watching your balance go up and down can be scary.  You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions \u2014 don\u2019t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you\u2019re at least saving as much as you can to get that \u201cfree money.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:03:05", "tags":

"note_en": "A report from  Bloomberg this week has made public something that should already have been apparent to tech industry observers: Apple is planning to  replace Intel processors in Mac computerswith its own chips starting sometime around 2020. The two California companies have enjoyed a long and fruitful partnership ever since Apple made the switch to Intel CPUs with the 2006 MacBook Pro and iMac, but recent trends have made the breakup between them inevitable. Intel \u2019s chip improvements have stagnated  ...\n Apple\u2019s decision to ditch the world\u2019s most popular CPU line for laptop and desktop computers may seem radical, but there are a number of key factors that actually make it obvious and unavoidable.\n  Attend any major tech exhibition and you \u2019ll find Intel announcing or reannouncing mildly improved processors. Whether you \u2019re at IFA in Berlin, CES in Las Vegas, or Computex in Taipei, the spiel is always the same: the future is wireless, battery life matters to everyone, and there are a lot of people with five-year-old PCs who might notice a difference if they buy a new Intel-powered computer. It \u2019s all painfully incremental and out of sync with Apple \u2019s product cadence. Apple will give you,  ...\n In the past, Intel could rely on microarchitecture changes one year and production process shrinkage another year to maintain its momentum of improvement. But the infamous Moore\u2019s Law  sputtered to an end back in 2015. Intel is  approaching the limits of what\u2019s possible to achieve with silicon, and it hasn\u2019t yet figured out its next step. The chart below,  compiled by  AnandTech, illustrates Intel \u2019s predicament well. Notice how long the 14nm process node has endured, the question marks next to  ...\n    If there\u2019s one unifying theme to define everything that Apple does, it\u2019s integration. From integrating components on a logic board to integrating an entire ecosystem of Apple devices like the iPhone, Macs, AirPods, and HomePod to integrating supply and distribution lines under its centralized control. Apple started designing its own iPhone chips because it didn\u2019t want to be dependent on Qualcomm. A year ago, it started making its own graphics processors to  shed its reliance on Imagination Technologies  ...\n  Apple will tell you that it \u2019s obsessed with delighting the consumer, crafting elegantly designed objects, or some other lofty aspiration, but the company \u2019s overriding ambition is to control every last minute aspect of its products. The Intel chips that have been at the heart of MacBooks and Macs for over a decade aren \u2019t minute; they \u2019re central to how each computer can be designed and engineered. Apple has stuck with them for so long because of Intel \u2019s once-insurmountable lead, but the  ...\n  Apple\u2019s macOS, the operating system that runs on Intel\u2019s x86 architecture, is now  legacy software. This may sound like a blunt allegation to make, given that Apple still sells plenty of MacBooks and iMacs, but the development of that OS within Apple seems to have halted entirely. Today, macOS feels like it\u2019s in maintenance mode, awaiting a widely anticipated change that will produce a unified iOS and macOS operating system, with iOS taking precedence.\n If this is true, it\u2019s another step towards the next great Apple machine: a consumer laptop running iOS. Call it the MacPad, or revive the name iBook. Use the trackpad the way 3D Touch is used on iOS devices to easily move the cursor. (And build more tricks into it.) I\u2019ll buy it.  https://t.co/s2gWAA8fWk\n\u2014 Walt Mossberg (@waltmossberg)  April 2, 2018\n Mobile computing has firmly established itself as the predominant mode of use these days, and that trend will only grow more pronounced in the future. Apple\u2019s primary software focus is rightly fixed on iOS, which happens to run on ARM instructions, not Intel\u2019s x86. So, if Apple is indeed intent on bringing iOS up into its less-portable computing line, and if it has chips that offer comparable performance to Intel\u2019s consumer CPUs ( which it does), why not build all of that on top of its own  ...\n  The thing that makes it possible for Apple to even contemplate running its lithe mobile operating system on its more powerful computers is the way our computing habits are changing. Not only are we using mobile devices more often than desktop ones for entertainment, but we\u2019re now doing most of our work on phones as well. You can be a  professional photographerwith just a Pixel 2, for instance. The phrase \u201cphoning it in \u201dcertainly has a whole different ring to it in 2018 than it did at the  ...\n As investment and development dollars continue flowing into the dominant mobile platforms \u2014Android and iOS \u2014it \u2019s logical to expect that every useful desktop application that hasn \u2019t yet been adapted to them already is on its way there. Sure, Intel is likely to retain its dominance at the very high end of computing, but for the vast majority of people and situations, iOS will soon be able to provide all that users want. And once the software reaches that point, Apple will want to match  ...\n   It\u2019s not just Apple that\u2019s moving away from Intel processors. Google has been  hiring and  dabbling with its own custom chip designs, and Microsoft and Qualcomm this year started pushing  Windows on ARM as an alternative to the typical Intel-powered laptops. The whole technology world is moving to developing and designing for mobile applications first, and Intel\u2019s desktop roots keep holding it back from being competitive in that expanding market.",

"note_en": "Provided with genre, artist, and lyrics as input, Jukebox outputs a new music sample produced from scratch. Below, we show some of our favorite samples.\n        Explore All Samples\n   Automatic music generation dates back to more than half a century.     A prominent approach is to generate music symbolically in the form of a piano roll, which specifies the timing, pitch, velocity, and instrument of each note to be played. This has led to impressive results like producing Bach chorals,   polyphonic music with multiple instruments,    as well as minute long musical pieces.\n But symbolic generators have limitations\u2014they cannot capture human voices or many of the more subtle timbres, dynamics, and expressivity that are essential to music. A different approach  [1] is to model music directly as raw audio.     Generating music at the audio level is challenging since the sequences are very long.  A typical 4-minute song at CD quality (44 kHz, 16-bit) has over 10 million timesteps. For comparison, GPT-2 had 1,000 timesteps and  OpenAI Fivetook tens of thousands of timesteps  ...\n One way of addressing the long input problem is to use an autoencoder that compresses raw audio to a lower-dimensional space by discarding some of the perceptually irrelevant bits of information. We can then train a model to generate audio in this compressed space, and upsample back to the raw audio space.\n We chose to work on music because we want to continue to push the boundaries of generative models. Our previous work on  MuseNet explored synthesizing music based on large amounts of MIDI data. Now in raw audio, our models must learn to tackle high diversity as well as very long range structure, and the raw audio domain is particularly unforgiving of errors in short, medium, or long term timing.\n    Jukebox&#39;s autoencoder model compresses audio to a discrete space, using a quantization-based approach called VQ-VAE.  Hierarchical VQ-VAEs  can generate short instrumental pieces from a few sets of instruments, however they suffer from hierarchy collapse due to use of successive encoders coupled with autoregressive decoders. A simplified variant called VQ-VAE-2 avoids these issues by using feedforward encoders and decoders only, and they show impressive results at generating high-fidelity  ...\n We draw inspiration from VQ-VAE-2 and apply their approach to music. We modify their architecture as follows:\n To alleviate codebook collapse common to VQ-VAE models, we use random restarts where we randomly reset a codebook vector to one of the encoded hidden states whenever its usage falls below a threshold.\n To maximize the use of the upper levels, we use separate decoders and independently reconstruct the input from the codes of each level.\n To allow the model to reconstruct higher frequencies easily, we add a spectral loss   that penalizes the norm of the difference of input and reconstructed spectrograms.\n We use three levels in our VQ-VAE, shown below, which compress the 44kHz raw audio by 8x, 32x, and 128x, respectively, with a codebook size of 2048 for each level. This downsampling loses much of the audio detail, and sounds noticeably noisy as we go further down the levels. However, it retains essential information about the pitch, timbre, and volume of the audio.\n   Next, we train the prior models whose goal is to learn the distribution of music codes encoded by VQ-VAE and to generate music in this compressed discrete space. Like the VQ-VAE, we have three levels of priors: a top-level prior that generates the most compressed codes, and two upsampling priors that generate less compressed codes conditioned on above.\n The top-level prior models the long-range structure of music, and samples decoded from this level have lower audio quality but capture high-level semantics like singing and melodies. The middle and bottom upsampling priors add local musical structures like timbre, significantly improving the audio quality.\n We train these as autoregressive models using a simplified variant of Sparse Transformers.   Each of these models has 72 layers of factorized self-attention on a context of 8192 codes, which corresponds to approximately 24 seconds, 6 seconds, and 1.5 seconds of raw audio at the top, middle and bottom levels, respectively.\n Once all of the priors are trained, we can generate codes from the top level, upsample them using the upsamplers, and decode them back to the raw audio space using the VQ-VAE decoder to sample novel songs.\n  To train this model, we crawled the web to curate a new dataset of 1.2 million songs (600,000 of which are in English), paired with the corresponding lyrics and metadata from  LyricWiki. The metadata includes artist, album genre, and year of the songs, along with common moods or playlist keywords associated with each song. We train on 32-bit, 44.1 kHz raw audio, and perform data augmentation by randomly downmixing the right and left channels to produce mono audio.\n  The top-level transformer is trained on the task of predicting compressed audio tokens. We can provide additional information, such as the artist and genre for each song. This has two advantages: first, it reduces the entropy of the audio prediction, so the model is able to achieve better quality in any particular style; second, at generation time, we are able to steer the model to generate in a style of our choosing.\n This t-SNE  below shows how the model learns, in an unsupervised way, to cluster similar artists and genres close together, and also makes some surprising associations like Jennifer Lopez being so close to Dolly Parton!\n    In addition to conditioning on artist and genre, we can provide more context at training time by conditioning the model on the lyrics for a song. A significant challenge is the lack of a well-aligned dataset: we only have lyrics at a song level without alignment to the music, and thus for a given chunk of audio we don \u2019t know precisely which portion of the lyrics (if any) appear. We also may have song versions that don \u2019t match the lyric versions, as might occur if a given song  ...\n To match audio portions to their corresponding lyrics, we begin with a simple heuristic that aligns the characters of the lyrics to linearly span the duration of each song, and pass a fixed-size window of characters centered around the current segment during training. While this simple strategy of linear alignment worked surprisingly well, we found that it fails for certain genres with fast lyrics, such as hip hop. To address this, we use Spleeter to extract vocals from each  ...\n To attend to the lyrics, we add an encoder to produce a representation for the lyrics, and add attention layers that use queries from the music decoder to attend to keys and values from the lyrics encoder. After training, the model learns a more precise alignment.\n   While Jukebox represents a step forward in musical quality, coherence, length of audio sample, and ability to condition on artist, genre, and lyrics, there is a significant gap between these generations and human-created music.\n For example, while the generated songs show local musical coherence, follow traditional chord patterns, and can even feature impressive solos, we do not hear familiar larger musical structures such as choruses that repeat. Our downsampling and upsampling process introduces discernable noise. Improving the VQ-VAE so its codes capture more musical information would help reduce this. Our models are also slow to sample from, because of the autoregressive nature of sampling. It  ...\n  Our audio team is continuing to work on generating audio samples conditioned on different kinds of priming information. In particular, we&#39;ve seen early success conditioning on MIDI files and stem files. Here&#39;s an example of a  raw audio sample conditioned on  MIDI tokens. We hope this will improve the musicality of samples (in the way conditioning on lyrics improved the singing), and this would also be a way of giving musicians more control over the generations. We  ...\n As generative modeling across various domains continues to advance, we are also conducting research into issues like  bias and  intellectual property rights, and are engaging with people who work in the domains where we develop tools. To better understand future implications for the music community, we shared Jukebox with an initial set of 10 musicians from various genres to discuss their feedback on this work. While Jukebox is an interesting research result, these musicians  ...\n   Our first raw audio model, which learns to recreate instruments like Piano and Violin. We try a dataset of rock and pop songs, and surprisingly it works.\n  We collect a larger and more diverse dataset of songs, with labels for genres and artists. Model picks up artist and genre styles more consistently with diversity, and at convergence can also produce full-length songs with long-range coherence.\n  We scale our VQ-VAE from 22 to 44kHz to achieve higher quality audio. We also scale top-level prior from 1B to 5B to capture the increased information. We see better musical quality, clear singing, and long-range coherence. We also make novel completions of real songs.\n  We start training models conditioned on lyrics to incorporate further conditioning information. We only have unaligned lyrics, so model has to learn alignment and pronunciation, as well as singing.\n Thank you to the following for their feedback on this work and contributions to this release:Jack Clark, Gretchen Krueger, Miles Brundage, Jeff Clune, Jakub Pachocki, Ryan Lowe, Shan Carter, David Luan, Vedant Misra, Daniela Amodei, Greg Brockman, Kelly Sims, Karson Elmgren, Bianca Martin, Rewon Child, Will Guss, Rob Laidlow, Rachel White, Delwin Campbell, Tasso Smith, Matthew Suttor, Konrad Kaczmarek, Scott Petersen, Dakota Stipp, Jena Ezzeddine\n    Hiller Jr, L.

"note_en": "The news that Professor John Martinis had resigned from Google sent ripples through the entire quantum community.\u00a0A few days after the announcement, I was on two previously scheduled calls with quantum executives and a call with another quantum\u00a0CEO.\u00a0Each was as baffled and as curious about Professor Martinis&#39; departure from Google as I was.\n  I had read a few quotes attributed to Professor Martinis as the reason he resigned.\u00a0Somehow the remarks seemed to lack enough \u00a0justification for such a big move on his part. I thought more detail was needed, and Professor Martinis agreed to clarify the record.\n  We are in an era of quantum experimentation and development. There are a handful of quantum scientists today that I believe will be historical figures a hundred years from now.\u00a0John Martinis is one of those people.\u00a0He has made monumental contributions to quantum computing, including handing Google the title to the historic achievement of quantum supremacy.\n     For those reasons, instead of an article with a few quotes by him, I decided to publish the full transcript of our conversation, and Professor Martinis gave his permission.\u00a0In the interview, he describes details of his complex situation and why he ultimately decided to resign. \u00a0Additionally, you&#39;ll find many nuggets and surprises in the \u00a0interview.\n  Small parts of the transcript have been edited for clarity and I have entered notes where appropriate. My original plan was to provide a summary of my thoughts and conclusions. However, Professor Martinis was completely open about his relationship with the hardware group and with his manager, Hartmut Neven, founder of the Google Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab. After reviewing the transcript, I felt everything was said that needed to be said. All my questions were answered. I will say  ...\n        I was very\u00a0curious about the reason you left Google. The quote that was attributed to you as the reason didn&#39;t make sense to me.\u00a0So maybe we could start at the beginning for some background.\n            Yes, that&#39;s right. I was a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and we had government funding and were doing quite well. Google got interested and my group and I came over to work at Google, basically because we both wanted to build a useful quantum computer.\n        I think at the time it was in the teens.\u00a0It was a good-sized group, but not everyone came over at first.\u00a0For most of the students, they came to Google after they graduated with their PhD.\n    I did a count and it appears that you and your group published about 200 papers while you were at Google.\n    While at Google, that seems high, but I have published a large number of papers in my career and a lot of them on quantum. I was also involved in other research.\u00a0I actually started with quantum computing when I was a PhD student way back in the mid-eighties at UC Berkeley.\n    What was the agreement when you first went to Google as far as maintaining a leadership role?\n    So, of course I had a leadership role at UC Santa Barbara, and I was quite concerned about changing that. When I moved to Google, Hartmut [Neven] was running the project.\u00a0He had started a quantum project [at google] and he&#39;s the one who wanted to hire me.\u00a0I was the head of the hardware group and he was head of the whole quantum AI group. So that&#39;s the way we started.\n    You did some amazing work while you were at Google. You\u00a0handed them the title to quantum supremacy. There was some controversy, but it was an important\u00a0milestone, and you did it.\n    We talked publicly about quantum supremacy for a couple of years and how we were going to do it. I think a lot of people thought it was a pretty bold milestone, but we were excited about the challenge.\u00a0I thought the later controversy drummed up by IBM was a kind of\u00a0fake news.\u00a0But in the end, it worked out okay, as controversy brought attention.\n    As it turned out, if you&#39;d used\u00a0a few more qubits, it would have been far beyond the reach of any classical computer and there would have been no question about its validity.\n    Yes, that \u2019s correct. Scott Aaronson at UT Austin wrote a piece in the New York Times describing the impact. You can quibble about details, but the strangest part is that IBM said that the Summit computer was able to do this, but it was basically a white paper, and they [IBM] actually didn&#39;t run a program. Of course, if you&#39;re going to claim something for experimental physics or computer science, you should actually run programs. I&#39;ve  ...\n    When did you first sense there was a problem with your relationship at Google with Hartmut Neven?\n    This is a complex situation, but I can outline it for you. There has been tension for several years now, but it mostly has been with the hardware group. It started around the time we first proposed quantum supremacy. To explain the tension, you should understand that my personal research style tends to be very intently focused. For example, with the quantum supremacy experiment, I focused on doing the experiment because I thought it would be  ...\n  Note: At this point, Professor Martinis asked me if I had read Peter Thiel&#39;s book,  Zero to One. Thiel was a co-founder of\u00a0PayPal and Palantir. He explained that Peter Thiel defines personality styles as either a definite optimist or indefinite optimist. Professor  Martinis considers himself to be a definite optimist. One quote from Thiel&#39;s book seems to mirror his thinking: \u201c\u2026a definite person determines the one best thing to do and  ...\n    It&#39;s okay. Anyway, he [Peter Thiel] says that most people in the US are indefinite optimists. And everyone says, oh yeah, we can build a quantum computer, but everyone is doing very general research on it, but with indefinite goals. My view is, I definitely want to create a quantum computer with some particular design. I saw the quantum supremacy experiment and I thought let&#39;s focus on this and let&#39;s get it to work. So, there&#39;s  ...\n        My personality is to intensely focus on some goal.\u00a0\u00a0I think this was hard on the group.\u00a0Once we got quantum supremacy to work, and we didn&#39;t need such intense focus, people naturally wanted more independence.\n  Also, leaders of the group came from UC Santa Barbara, and it&#39;s very natural to want to leave your advisor and form your own group and be independent.\u00a0Hartmut saw that too, and he is much more of an indefinite optimist than I am.\u00a0Seeing all\u00a0the tension, they [the group] and management thought it would be better if I wasn&#39;t leading the project anymore. Three people in the project would be co-leaders and I would be advising.\n        Initially, I thought it wasn&#39;t going to work for me. But it was clear that&#39;s what everyone wanted. We went ahead and I tried it for nine months. During those nine months I was productive, as I invented a way to scale up the qubits and solved some wiring technology. I was doing my job, but I felt uncomfortable about the direction the project was going on the five to ten-year time scale. After some other bad events happened,  ...\n    Yes, I completely understand. What was competing for control of the group at the time? Was it anything in particular or was it just that the group wanted more freedom?\n    Yes. I&#39;ll give you a\u00a0specific example that happened last year.\u00a0It was very difficult for me at the time.\n  When wiring a qubit system, it is very important to figure it out in a scalable, cost-sensitive way. I had been developing some new technology that was quite far along. I was quite proud of various inventions, as solutions were somewhat tricky, and you had to think very carefully about how to build a system. Wiring is funny as it is something that everyone thinks they can do, but it&#39;s subtle. But one theorist, who  ...\n  This went on and on, so I started talking to Hartmut about it, explaining that it didn&#39;t make sense. We have a relatively small group and we don&#39;t have an abundance of \u00a0resources. And I have it covered, so we should stop this other program.\u00a0But Hartmut didn\u2019t back me up and wanted to go ahead and try both.\n  I guess I just didn&#39;t handle that very well. I was the lead of the hardware group, but I couldn&#39;t stop a project that didn&#39;t make any sense to me.\n        More precisely, I had already lost control. I wasn&#39;t really leading the hardware group, but of course still felt responsibility, like getting the quantum supremacy experiment to work. In the end, Hartmut and I just disagreed on what to do. But he&#39;s the boss, so it \u2019s his decision. I think this whole year-long process made me very uncomfortable, and I just couldn&#39;t handle it because I have been making  ...\n    You were making good progress toward increasing the number of qubits. I think one of the quotes I read said that you were on the path\u00a0to making a quantum computer with a few hundred to a thousand qubits.\n    Yes, we have this plan, and even one for a much larger quantum computer.\u00a0As a definite optimist, I liked that we had a definite plan that made sense to the group.\u00a0After the quantum supremacy results, google management was very supportive, so everything was going great.\n        Yes, but I was not very happy because I disagreed with some important decisions. I had many talks with Hartmut about it, especially about the leadership role.\u00a0I thought it would be the most reliable path to follow my expertise, since I have had a successful history.\n  And in the end, I felt that the group had a good plan, and they know what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re all very smart, they&#39;re going to be happy doing it their way. And I can go off and do science in the way I know best.\u00a0I want to help the world of quantum computing in a way that makes sense to me.\n  I&#39;m sad because I really thought we really could build something amazing together, but you know, things don&#39;t always work out the way you want.\u00a0You just have to figure out the best way forward.\n    When you get in a situation like that, it&#39;s a lot easier if you just step away.\u00a0I assume you&#39;re going to keep working on quantum projects.\n    I&#39;ve had a lot of inquiries from people. And I still would like to build a quantum computer with this definite-optimistic approach.\u00a0But this requires a good amount of funding, so I\u2019ll see if it\u2019s possible.\n  One idea is to work with other qubits groups, who are making different qubits, to figure out how they can scale up and build a large quantum computer.\u00a0Because I have an example with superconducting qubits that I now understand well, I hope to use those ideas for these other approaches. So, this might be a great opportunity.\n        Yes, I would. We would obviously want to discuss all of this.\u00a0Maybe we just need right now some social distancing. I did like working for Google and Hartmut, and maybe there is some way to make everyone happy.\u00a0I wish them the best. They&#39;re a great team.\n        There&#39;s going to be some really nice papers coming out using the quantum-supremacy Sycamore chip. Maybe not be quite so impactful [as quantum supremacy], but they are really going to advance the field a lot in applications as a cloud quantum computer. There should be more great results coming out of the group in the next few years.\n        Oh yes.\u00a0Everyone is still working there, which is great.\u00a0They will have more independence and say in planning their project, so I am happy for them.\n    When do you think we&#39;ll see a useful superconducting quantum computer? Can we do it in the next five years?\n    Hartmut has talked about this, so I can explain some more. The Google plan is roughly to build a million-qubit system in about ten years, with sufficiently low errors to do error correction. Then at that point you will have enough error-corrected logical qubits that you can run useful, powerful algorithms that you now can&#39;t solve on a classical supercomputer.  ...\n    Well, that&#39;s all my questions. I really appreciate your time. Is there anything I didn&#39;t ask that you would like to say?\n    Oh, I&#39;m just going to say that technically the group at Google is doing great. They have a good plan. They have really good scientists there. And I&#39;m excited that they&#39;ll be able to make progress and push this forward.\u00a0I wish them the best.\n        Okay.

"note_en": "Gun.js is an open-source project I&#39;ve had my eye on for several years now, every once in a while checking back to see how it&#39;s progressed, and whether the project I&#39;m working on at the time is a good fit for it.\n Gun stands out as one of the few players that&#39;s actually delivering a peer-to-peer / decentralized system that works on a large scale.\n   Looks like they&#39;ve got a CRDT setup where they denormalize any nested data structures, so you can modify one attribute on one client and another attribute on another, and the changes will be merged. For a given atomic attribute, it uses &#34;last-write-wins&#34; (for a best-effort definition of &#34;last&#34; based on a  hybrid logical clock).\n Is there consistency verification built-in, to detect if you&#39;re in a broken state? (e.g. merkle tries or similar hashing method to ensure that peers&#39; data haven&#39;t been corrupted somehow)\n I couldn&#39;t see anything in the docs about this, and couldn&#39;t figure out anything from the source code. I asked about this in the community chat, and apparently there&#39;s some hashing that&#39;s used to determine when to &#34;stop syncing&#34; between two peers.\n From their  CRDT docs it looks like they use a  hybrid logical clock, so intent should be preserved pretty well.\n   The client stores a copy of the data it has used (which could be a subset of the full graph), and also keeps track of &#34;unsynced changes&#34;.\n O(size of the data) - which means the server doesn&#39;t retain a history of changes, and so is able to keep size down.\n It appears there&#39;s a fair amount of communication back &amp; forth, negotiating what nodes need to be replicated, as well as connecting peers to each other -- &#34;relaying&#34; along data that one peer needs that another one has.\n  The code is written in a quite idiosyncratic style, such that I had a good amount of difficulty desciphering it \ud83d\ude05. It doesn&#39;t use consistent formatting, and makes extensive use of mutation, single-character variable names, custom async execution flow, etc. Additionally, some core parts of the code depend on accessing &amp; mutating (monkey-patching) global objects. Now, aesthetics certainly isn&#39;t everything, but code that&#39;s readable, well-commented, etc. lends a level of &#34;production-ready&#34;  ...\n A community member has created  a typescript rewrite of gun.js, using async/await, more modern formatting, etc. I don&#39;t know if there are plans to give it official status though, or how complete it is.\n  It puts no restrictions on schema changes. This also means there&#39;s no schema validation in place, however.\n Yes, no arrays. GUN has the concept of a  &#34;set&#34; built in, which works as a kind of &#34;unordered array&#34;, but you need to &#34;add&#34; each item individually, and the items are required to be unique, and of course you have to figure out how to sort them yourself. (Further investigation turned up  this experimental project which appears to be working toward sorted-array support in Gun, but it&#39;s certainly not in a reusable/production state at the moment).\n Additionally, GUN enforces denormalization, so when you retrieve an object that has &#34;nested&#34; objects inside of it, you need to make another async call to fetch the nested object. You can optionally include a script to give you  a  .open() function, which does the extra calls for you, but the docs steer you away from it (if your &#34;graph&#34; is deeply nested, recursively loading everything can be quite expensive).\n The &#34;storage backends&#34; that are supported out of the box are flat files (for nodejs) and localStorage or IndexedDB in the browser. It looks like you&#39;d be able to write storage adapter for sqlite / postgres / etc., but you&#39;d be blazing your own trail.\n Can it sync with Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.? (Such that users &#34;bring their own storage backend&#34;)\n Does the client implementation require all data to live in memory, or can it work with mostly-persisted data?\n With the default (localstorage) persistence, all data lives in memory, but apparently (again, not documented but I asked in the community chat) with other persistence backends it doesn&#39;t need all data to live in memory.\n Yes! By default, data that&#39;s added under your &#34;user&#34; sub-graph is cryptographically  signed, but publicly readable. You can optionally encrypt the data &amp; decrypt it as well with your user&#39;s keypair. Depending on how you encrypt, it could prevent &#34;merging&#34; your objects however (for example, if you encrypt whole objects  as in this example, the system can&#39;t merge encrypted objects).\n Is multi-user collaboration possible, where some users only have access to a subset of the data?\n Yes, but you&#39;ll be implementing a lot of custom encryption / key management logic yourself. Out of the box, GUN gives you user auth, where each user has a public and private key which can be used for encryption. If user A wants to allow &#34;read&#34; access to user B, one way to do that is to get user B&#39;s public key and use that to encrypt the data (see this  remarkably in-depth cartoon explainerfor more on that). However, if they then want to give read access to user C as well,  ...\n Not currently. There are a number of proof-of-concept-level implementations, but nothing reusable that I could find.\n  Yes! There are a number of gun-based applications being run in production, most notably  notabug (a reddit clone that&#39;s resistent to censorship/moderation) and  Iris (a social networking / social media app). The discord bot claims &#34;8M users&#34;, although I had some trouble verifying that number. Archive.org is listed (part of their  dweb initiative) but that doesn&#39;t appear to be running anymore.  dtube is also listed, but  gun was removed as a dependencyin March, and it doesn&#39;t  ...\n Quite well! The local instance only replicates the parts of the graph that you&#39;ve accessed, so when you&#39;re offline you can only read things you&#39;ve already read. But you can update &amp; add things without limit.\n Not when disconnected from a server (remote peer). When connected to a server, updates between tabs propagate correctly, as each tab is synchronizing independently with the server.\n Auth is included as an integral part of the system. Some interesting aspects of the authentication system is that usernames are not guarenteed to be unique, and there is no established recourse for lost passwords (see  this FAQ pagefor some discussion of possible remedies, but there&#39;s nothing established as far as I can tell). If you wanted to have a &#34;private graph&#34;, you could probably gate the synchronization with some custom authentication, but it&#39;s clearly not something  ...\n There is a lot of documentation, but there are some indications that it&#39;s not complete (I came across several API methods that weren&#39;t documented, but appear to be public, for example).\n  Under the default configuration, a &#34;server&#34; (relay peer) doesn&#39;t put any restrictions on what data it will replicate, meaning that any developer could point their app at your instance and store data on it. Some apps have added a layer of security on top of GUN -- for example,  here&#39;s a community pluginthat extends Gun to reject data that doesn&#39;t match a given schema. This does go somewhat against the &#34;vision&#34; of Gun, however, where the idea is to have one universal  ...\n  Gun is much more than a database; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an exaggeration to say that Mark Nadal is working on a whole new internet, a global decentralized peer-to-peer graph that requires and creates a new and different paradigm. So, if you&#39;re looking for a normal database, this might not be the one for you \ud83d\ude09. On the other hand, if you&#39;re looking for a decentralized, peer-to-peer data management system, Gun is just about the only player that is achieving the vision, in production,  ...\n The biggest caveat I&#39;d give for working with Gun is: be prepared to implement a lot of things yourself, and bend your mind to a new distributed, p2p-graph paradigm. Gun provides an impressive set of underlying primitives, and there are lots of folks building very cool things with them, but, as with many &#34;cutting edge&#34; technologies, you&#39;ll need to be prepared to get a few cuts, and get your hands dirty molding it into the application platform that your app needs.\n Don&#39;t let that put you off, though! You&#39;ll find the community extremely welcoming and helpful in your journey -- especially the &#34;BDFL&#34; Mark Nadal, who is enthusiastic, passionate about the project, and definitely in this for the long haul.\n Please drop me a note  on twitter if there&#39;s anything I should add or correct!", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:02:48", "tags": "database,\u6570\u636e\u5e93,\u8bc4\u4f30,gunjs,\u662f\u5426", "title": "\u8bc4\u4f30GunJS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672c\u5730\u4f18\u5148\u6570\u636e\u5e93", "title_en": "Evaluating GunJS as a local-first database", "transed": 0, "url": "https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/local-first-database-gun-js/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["database", "\u6570\u636e\u5e93", "\u8bc4\u4f30", "gunjs", "\u662f\u5426"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2516b14c5c90a80fd7cc81d9d86c6baa.png", "infoid": 1000261, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u672c\u671f\u8282\u76ee\u7531ReferralHero\u8d5e\u52a9\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u7075\u6d3b\u63a8\u8350\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u4eca\u5929\u6ce8\u518c\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u83b7\u5f97\u516b\u6298\u4f18\u60e0\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e3a\u201cFAILORY20\u201d\u3002\nClearscope-\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5438\u5f15\u66f4\u591a\u641c\u7d22\u6d41\u91cf\u3002\nDickey\u2018s\u70e7\u70e4\u5751-\u603b\u90e8\u8bbe\u5728\u5fb7\u514b\u8428\u65af\u5dde\u8fbe\u62c9\u65af\u7684\u5bb6\u65cf\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u70e7\u70e4\u9910\u5385\u8fde\u9501\u5e97\u3002\nMosec\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8\u79d8\u4e66-Mosec\u79fb\u52a8\u79d8\u4e66\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u4ec5\u652f\u6301Android\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5546\u52a1\u4f1a\u8bae\u548c\u4ea4\u6d41\u3002\n42Floors-\u4e00\u4e2a\u5546\u4e1a\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f60\u641c\u7d22\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u623f\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4f60\u76f4\u63a5\u5411\u623f\u6e90\u4ee3\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\n\u6e38\u620f\u8dd1\u6b65\u8005-\u4e00\u79cd\u6559\u7ec3\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5feb\u5730\u638c\u63e1\u6700\u597d\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u73a9\u5bb6\u4fdd\u6301\u9886\u5148\u5730\u4f4d\u3002\n\u8ba2\u9605\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\uff0c\u6bcf\u5468\u6536\u5230\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u64ad\u5ba2+\u8bbf\u95ee+80\u4e2a\u542f\u52a8\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u6613\u4f5c\u4e3a\u793c\u7269\u3002", "note_en": "This episode is sponsored by    ReferralHero , the all-in-one platform to design and run flexible referral programs.
