The proposal asserts that the current Internet protocol is unsuitable for the development of new digital applications and that this calls for the development of a new protocol.\n The Commission notes that the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) has demonstrated a high level of resilience, scalability and adaptability, enabling the growth of the global Internet to date. Its resilience and adaptability have been tested during the COVID-19 crisis.\n The Commission acknowledges the need for the continuous improvement of the Internet protocols, but considers that this should take place primarily in the relevant Internet standards bodies, based on a decision-making process that is transparent, bottom-up and open to all stakeholders.\n The EU, represented by the Commission, is a sector member of the ITU, while the 27 EU Member States are full members. The Commission is considering to propose a EU position on key issues at the forthcoming World Telecommunication Standardisation Assembly (WTSA) taking place in India in November\u00a02020, including on the one subject to this written question.\n In the ITU like in other Internet governance bodies, the Commission, representing the Union, defends the vision of a single, open, neutral, free and un-fragmented Internet, supporting permission-less innovation, privacy and users\u2019 empowerment, as well as the protection of all fundamental rights online or offline.", "posttime": "2020-06-04

"note_en": "A full autopsy report on George Floyd, the man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police last month, reveals that he was positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The 20-page report also indicates that Floyd had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system at the time of his death, although the drugs are not listed as the cause.\n  The  report released Wednesday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner&#39;s Office is dated May 25, the same day Floyd died. In video taken by bystanders, Floyd, 46, is shown repeatedly pleading that he cannot breathe as he is held down with a knee on his neck by former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin, with three other officers present. The incident has sparked nationwide \u2014 and even worldwide \u2014 protests.\n    The autopsy report concludes the cause of death was &#34;cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.&#34; That conclusion, death due to heart failure, differs from the one reached by an independent examiner hired by the Floyd family, which listed the cause of death as &#34;asphyxiation from sustained pressure.&#34;\n    The medical examiner&#39;s report does not mention asphyxiation. Preliminary results from that report were released publicly on Monday. According to prosecutors, who filed charging documents last week, the results &#34;revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.&#34;\n  The medical examiner&#39;s report also details blunt-force injuries to the skin of Floyd&#39;s head, face and upper lip, as well as the shoulders, hands and elbows and bruising of the wrists consistent with handcuffs.\n  Signed by Dr. Andrew M. Baker, it says Floyd had tested positive for the novel coronavirus on April 3. A post-mortem nasal swab confirmed that diagnosis. The report notes that because a positive result for coronavirus can persist for weeks after the disease has resolved, &#34;the result most likely reflects asymptomatic but persistent ... positivity from previous infection.&#34;\n  In addition to fentanyl and methamphetamine, the toxicology report from the autopsy showed that Floyd also had cannabinoids in his system when he died.\n  Floyd also had heart disease, hypertension and  sickle cell trait \u2014 a mostly asymptomatic form of the more serious sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder that primarily affects African Americans.\n  Also on Wednesday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison  announced upgraded charges of second-degree unintentional murder against Chauvin. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison.\n  &#34;To the Floyd family, to our beloved community, and everyone that is watching, I say: George Floyd mattered. He was loved. His life was important. His life had value. We will seek justice for him and for you and we will find it,&#34; Ellison said in announcing the new charges on television.\n  Three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time on Wednesday with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n A previous version of this story incorrectly said the charge of second-degree murder against Derek Chauvin carries a maximum penalty of 12.5 years in prison. In fact, that charge carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 21:59:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co is developing an electric van aimed at business users, joining a growing list of carmakers planning EVs for the same segment which includes customers such as Amazon.com Inc and United Parcel Service Inc, five people familiar with the plans told Reuters.\n  That multibillion-dollar strategy could enable GM, Ford Motor Co and at least two EV startups to build and deliver more electric vehicles at a time when consumer demand for battery-powered models is still a small fraction of overall industry sales, while targeting a potentially lucrative market segment that Tesla Inc has yet to address.\n GM\u2019s plan to develop an electric van has not previously been reported. The No. 1 U.S. automaker did not confirm the van, but has said it plans to introduce at least 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023, in a variety of body styles including sedans, trucks and crossovers.\n Suppliers familiar with such plans at GM and Ford told Reuters the Detroit automakers, which count trucks and commercial vehicles among their most profitable businesses, \u201cdon\u2019t want to leave the door open for Tesla\u201d as they did in consumer passenger cars.\n Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director of fleet maintenance and engineering, said the package delivery firm believes electric vans have the potential to disrupt the commercial market.\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to be similar to what the Model 3 has done for the consumer market,\u201d Phillippi said, referring to Tesla\u2019s small near-luxury electric sedan. \u201cNow all of a sudden, we\u2019re off to the races.\u201d\n The GM van \u2013 code-named BV1 \u2013 is due to start production in late 2021, the sources said. It is believed the BV1 van will share some components with GM\u2019s future electric pickups and SUVs, including the automaker\u2019s new Ultium advanced battery system. It is expected to be assembled alongside the electric trucks at GM\u2019s Detroit-Hamtramck plant.\n GM is considering whether to offer the electric van through its traditional truck brands - Chevrolet and GMC - or market it under a different brand such as Maven, the sources said. GM\u2019s first electric pickup truck, due in late 2021, will be sold by GMC dealers under the Hummer brand.\n In a statement, GM said it is \u201ccommitted to an all-electric future and is implementing a multi-segment, scalable EV strategy to get there. At this time, we do not have any announcements to make regarding electric commercial vehicles.\u201d\n The GM electric van project is aimed at an important segment of the emerging EV market \u2013 commercial delivery vehicles. For established players, this is a hugely profitable business segment driven by cost of ownership, not fancy tech or star power. It is also a segment in which Tesla and its high-profile CEO, Elon Musk, lack an entry to compete for sales and CO2 credits, which allow automakers to offset the sale of non-electric vehicles including high-margin pickups and SUVs.\n \u201cBuyers of commercial vans want reliability and not necessarily a flashy brand name,\u201d said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. \u201cThe reduced maintenance and fuel use of electric vehicles become very attractive to a business customer, where the current limitations of EVs make the price premium less attractive to individual consumers.\u201d\n In February, Ford said it would introduce an electric version of its Transit van for model year 2022. \u201cThe most critical bet we will be making over the next several years will be our commercial vehicles,\u201d Ford\u2019s chief operating officer, Jim Farley, told Reuters at the time.\n Ford also is an investor in Michigan-based startup Rivian, which is scheduled to begin building the first of 100,000 mid-size electric vans for Amazon next year.\n Amazon rival UPS has commissioned 10,000 mid-size electric vans from British startup Arrival, which is backed by Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor Co and its sister company Kia Motors Corp.\n  The combined value of the Amazon and UPS contracts with Rivian and Arrival is estimated at $4 billion or more.\n And more players in the segments will likely follow, including Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG (  VOWG_p.DE) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, said Samit Ghosh, chief executive of the Americas for consulting and engineering firm umlaut.\n \u201cThe delivery vans is a volume not to be underestimated,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not just call it a niche segment.\u201d", "posttime":

"note_en": "Cyber-attacks against anti-racism organisations shot up in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a leading provider of protection services says.\n Cloudflare, which blocks attacks designed to knock websites offline, says advocacy groups in general saw attacks increase 1,120-fold.\n   DDoS attacks - short for Distributed Denial of Service - are a relatively simple cyber-attack tool, in which the attacker tries to flood a website or other online service with so many fake &#34;users&#34; that it cannot cope.\n  The effect is that it gets knocked offline for people trying to access information or services.\n  Cloudflare says that after Mr Floyd&#39;s death and the ensuing violent clashes between police and protesters, it saw a noticeable jump in the amount of requests it blocked - an extra 19 billion (17%) from the corresponding weekend the previous month.\n  The problem was particularly acute for certain types of organisations. One single website belonging to an unnamed advocacy group dealt with 20,000 requests a second.\n Anti-racism groups which belong to Cloudflare&#39;s free programme for at-risk organisations saw a large surge in the past week, from near-zero to more than 120 million blocked requests.\n  Attacks on government and military websites were also up - by 1.8 and 3.8 times respectively.\n It follows  a sudden swell of interest in the &#34;hacktivist&#34; collective Anonymous, which has said it will support the protesters, and threatened to target the police in the city of Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed. The group has often used DDoS attacks in the past.\n  &#34;As we&#39;ve often seen in the past, real world protest and violence is usually accompanied by attacks on the internet,&#34;  Cloudflare said in a blog post written by its chief executive and chief technology officer.\n &#34;Unfortunately, if recent history is any guide, those who speak out against oppression will continue to face cyber-attacks that attempt to silence them.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-06-04 21:32:29", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f51\u7ad9,racism,\u7ec4\u7ec7", "title":

"note_en": "Three weeks ago, Elena*, a Krakow-based customer support agent for digital banking startup Revolut, dialled in to her weekly catch-up call with her team leader. She expected them to discuss an ongoing project. Instead, a few seconds into the call, she was told she was being fired.\n Elena was asked to pick between two documents: one said she was being terminated for underperformance, the other, a \u201cmutual agreement\u201d, offered her a small severance and stated she was choosing to leave the company of her own accord. She was shocked: two weeks earlier, she says her manager had assured her that her job was safe and that she was performing well. \u201cI thought maybe I should speak to another institution for legal advice because I am a foreigner,\u201d Elena says. \u201c[But] they said I had no additional time and that I have 30 minutes to make this decision.\u201d\n  Fearful for her career, Elena ended up choosing the mutual agreement. Elena is one of more than 50 employees in Poland and Portugal who it is claimed were pressured into leaving their jobs at Europe\u2019s fastest growing fintech startup since the coronavirus pandemic struck. Their numbers are not included in the recent  62 redundancies announced by Revolut \u2013 because they technically agreed to leave. Revolut says redundancies represented three per cent of its staff. \u201cIt was pretty stressful. In my friend\u2019s team two people were fired two hours before their shift [with no warning],\u201d says a former staff member who was dismissed in May.\n Current and former Revolut employees say staff were coerced into accepting terminations, even though the company had no legal grounds to fire them. Some say this happened after the company heavily pushed a voluntary scheme where staff were asked to sacrifice part of their salary in exchange for shares in the company.\n  Revolut confirmed that a small number of employees left the business for underperformance reasons, which are valid grounds for dismissal in Poland. These employees were advised of the reason for their exit orally and in writing in a meeting with their line manager and human resources manager.\n The Krakow office in Poland is at the heart of Revolut\u2019s operations: it is the company\u2019s biggest office, and employs more staff than its London headquarters. Alongside centres in Lithuania and Portugal, it is the main support and compliance hub for Revolut, where everything from customer complaints to compliance work are dealt with by almost 1,000 staff. To service clients in several different languages, Revolut hires people from around the world and gives them residency permits. Before Revolut staff started working from home in response to the pandemic, at the Krakow office you could find people from a list of countries as diverse as Italy, Chile and India, on starting average net salaries between 3,500 and 4,000 zlotys a month (\u00a3700 to \u00a3800).\n  Now, some of the employees allegedly pressured to leave have been left stranded in a foreign country without a job or health insurance in the middle of a pandemic. While the Polish government has expanded residency permits until the \u201cemergency period\u201d ends, people from outside the European Union risk losing their visas once this special provision is over.\n &#34;I had some interviews but employers do not sound very promising due to the current crisis and unwillingness to provide documents for residence permits,&#34; Elena says. \u201cThe most unexpected thing for me is that my health insurance will terminate during this Covid situation. I don\u2019t know what I would do if I get this virus.\u201d\n On April 14, a couple of weeks before Elena was fired, Revolut announced that it was trying to reduce potential redundancies through cost-cutting plans, despite having secured $500 million in new funding, pushing its valuation to $5.5 billion in February 2020. The company says these plans included a reduction in outsourcing costs and an \u201centirely voluntary\u201d salary sacrifice scheme, where any employee could exchange part of their wages for twice their value in Revolut share options. The shares in the scheme are valued at $121.4015 per share - the value of Revolut\u2019s last fundraising round.\n  According to a company presentation from May 11, over 60 per cent of staff opted into the scheme, which Revolut says will deliver around $900,000 in savings each month over the next 12 months. While some staff in Krakow and Porto say they were happy to participate, others say they felt pressured into opting into the scheme.\n  \u201cPeople are scared all the time that someone will fire them. I spoke with a few guys and they told me they gave away ten per cent at least because they were afraid that in the end they will look for the employees that didn\u2019t give the money back,\u201d says a source within the HR department. \u201cObviously they don\u2019t say we won\u2019t fire [if you participate in the scheme] but in the end the message was a bit like that. If you sacrifice money we\u2019ll stop firing people.\u201d\n In a message sent to the 495-strong customer support team on Slack shortly after the salary sacrifice scheme was announced, head of support Inna Grynova urged them to participate. \u201cSo far, almost 20 per cent of our employees globally have submitted their sacrifices. In Support we\u2019ve gathered only 44 submitions [sic] (out of 495 employees) which is a very small number,\u201d the message read.\n \u201cOur goal is to use SSS [salary sacrifice scheme] as an alternative to the need of employees redundancy and other cost cuts. So the success of SSS depends on all of us. If it won\u2019t be enough, unfortunately we would need to go for the other steps, which we\u2019ll try to avoid. The positive impact of SSS can be achieved only when we work together.\u201d\n Other managers and team leaders sent similar messages in the days prior to the closing of the scheme. Documents sent to staff say that as long as it is in line with local laws, employees can sacrifice as much as 100 per cent of their salary. But in at least one of Revolut\u2019s main jurisdictions this scheme could be illegal, according to Filipe Lamelas, labour lawyer and assistant researcher at Portugal\u2019s Collaborative Laboratory for Labour, Employment and Social Protection. \u201cAccording to Portuguese law, base salary cannot be reduced even by agreement.\u201d\n  A Revolut spokesperson admits that Portuguese law prohibits reductions in the \u201cbase salary\u201d, and the company is \u201cstill reviewing the best way to offer a scheme that offers an equivalent benefit to salary sacrifice in Portugal\u201d.\n There is no suggestion that salary sacrifice was undertaken in Portugal illegally. Those that opted into the scheme were not necessarily saving their own jobs or their colleagues\u2019. Decisions to fire staff had already been drawn up before these cost-cutting plans were announced, one source within the HR department claims. Days before the scheme was unveiled, a list with dozens of names of people that were to be fired was drawn up by heads of departments and senior HR executives, they say.\n In Poland, workers say they were told by their line managers and HR that they were underperforming and would be terminated if they didn\u2019t leave voluntarily. But in Portugal mutual agreements stated that dismissals were a result of a reduction of 40 per cent in the group\u2019s activity and a 30 per cent excess in staff numbers. By getting employees to voluntarily leave, Revolut has avoided launching a group redundancy consultation, that, among other things would give employees the right to severance payments and the chance to be offered alternative roles within the company. \u201c[Mutual agreement] is better for Revolut because they can\u2019t go to labour court [employment tribunal],\u201d says the source from the HR department. \u201cThe way they prepare the terminations are so bad that if someone would go to court Revolut would lose,\u201d the source claims.\n WIRED reviewed the testimony of employees and the documents given to them by Revolut with lawyers in Poland and Portugal who said the company could have acted unlawfully.\n Polish employment lawyer Grzegorz Ilnicki says the termination agreement given to Elena was not only missing key details required by law, but that forcing her to choose between that document and a \u201cmutual agreement\u201d could be illegal. \u201cThere are some verdicts in the Supreme Court in Poland that presenting these two documents to the same worker could be a criminal threat. The threat is that if you don\u2019t sign the mutual agreement we will terminate you because you are a bad worker,\u201d he says. A Revolut spokesperson says the company has respected local labour law requirements at all times.\n  In Portugal, the company asked employees to quickly sign mutual termination agreements without informing them that they had no legal obligation to do so. One employee says a colleague was blocked from accessing her email and other associated work accounts during a meeting with her manager and HR. Since she would only sign the mutual agreement if the terms were improved, the company was forced to reactivate her accounts the next day so she could continue working.This kind of activity could be considered harassment, according to Lamelas. Revolut says that all exits in Portugal were carried out legally.\n This wouldn\u2019t be the first time Revolut\u2019s practices have risked falling foul of employment law.  Last year it was revealed that the company was asking applicants for business development and PR roles to recruit customers for free in order to have a chance at getting a job. Andrius Biceika, the then head of business development and one of the executives that used this hiring practice, has since been promoted to interim chief people officer, the most senior HR role within the company, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n The company has also been criticised for an  almost religious adherence to key performance indicators (KPI) for every role, from HR, to recruitment and compliance.\n As coronavirus hit global travel, one of the key sectors that Revolut relies on \u2013 daily active people using the app \u2013 fell from 1.3 million on February 1 to 0.9 million on March 28, according to company documents seen by WIRED. This translated to less activity for many of the teams operating out of Krakow, Porto and Vilnius, including, but not limited to, the customer support team.\n Despite this drop in activity, the KPIs that were expected from employees were not dropped to match it. People that worked in the customer support department were still expected to do 60 chats a day to hit their target, even though at times no customers were online making requests to the support team. Some departments, like the compliance department\u2019s \u201cknow your customer\u201d team even had their KPIs increased, a former employee claims.\n  A Revolut spokesperson says its \u201cperformance management systems\u201d aim to support its employees in \u201cachieving their best at work and offer training and guidance\u201d. They add that employees \u201cmay leave the business if they are not making progress in their role\u201d.\n As lockdowns have started to ease in some European cities, activity amongst Revolut users has picked up again, returning to 1.1 million daily active people on May 9. That has meant that the workload has increased again for the customer support team, with a backlog of around 1,000 people regularly being left queuing for assistance, according to screenshots seen by WIRED.\n \u201cNow we are always with a backlog because a lot of people were fired,\u201d the Porto-based customer support agent says. \u201cI think they did things too quickly. And why? Because they don&#39;t care about people.\u201d\n            Get The Email from WIRED, your no-nonsense briefing on all the biggest stories in technology, business and science.

it&#39;s possible to predict an individual\u2019s patterns of thoughts and feelings by scanning their brain in an MRI machine as they perform some mental tasks.\n But a new analysis by some of the researchers who have done the most work in this area finds that those measurements are highly suspect when it comes to drawing conclusions about any individual person\u2019s brain.\n Watching the brain through a functional MRI machine (fMRI) is still great for finding the general brain structures involved in a given task across a group of people, said Ahmad Hariri, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University who led the reanalysis.\n \u201cScanning 50 people is going to accurately reveal what parts of the brain, on average, are more active during a mental task, like counting or remembering names,\u201d Hariri said\n Functional MRI measures blood flow as a proxy for brain activity. It shows where blood is being sent in the brain, presumably because neurons in that area are more active during a mental task.\n The problem is that the level of activity for any given person probably won\u2019t be the same twice, and a measure that changes every time it is collected cannot be applied to predict anyone\u2019s future mental health or behavior.\n Hariri and his colleagues reexamined 56 published papers based on fMRI data to gauge their reliability across 90 experiments. Hariri said the researchers recognized that \u201cthe correlation between one scan and a second is not even fair, it\u2019s poor.\u201d\n They also examined data from the brain-scanning Human Connectome Project -- \u201cOur field\u2019s Bible at the moment,\u201d Hariri called it -- and looked at test/retest results for 45 individuals. For six out of seven measures of brain function, the correlation between tests taken about four months apart with the same person was weak. The seventh measure studied, language processing, was only a fair correlation, not good or excellent.\n Finally they looked at data they collected through the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study in New Zealand, in which 20 individuals were put through task-based fMRI twice, two or three months apart. Again, they found poor correlation from one test to the next in an individual.\n The bottom line is that task-based fMRI in its current form can\u2019t tell you what an individual\u2019s brain activation will look like from one test to the next, Hariri said. The new analysis, appears June 3 in Psychological Science\n \u201cThis is more relevant to my work than just about anyone else\u2019s!\u201d Hariri said, his voice rising. \u201cThis is my fault. I\u2019m going to throw myself under the bus. This whole sub-branch of fMRI could go extinct if we can\u2019t address this critical limitation.\u201d\n Hariri has been using fMRI data as part of a long-term study of 1,300 undergraduate Duke students. By combining brain scans, genetic testing and psychological assessments, Hariri is searching for biomarkers of individual differences in the way people process thoughts and emotions, such as why one person comes away from a traumatic event with PTSD or depression and another does not.\n \u201cWe can\u2019t continue with the same old \u2018hot spot\u2019 research,\u201d Hariri said. \u201cWe could scan the same 1,300 undergrads again and we wouldn\u2019t see the same patterns for each of them.\u201d\n One possible solution to the reliability problem, using existing technology, would be to collect data for a full hour or longer in the scanner, not just five minutes. Hariri also said developing new tasks from the ground up with the explicit purpose of reliably measuring individual differences in brain activity is another strategy. In the meanwhile, Hariri and his team have shifted their focus to MRI measures of brain structure, which are highly reliable.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t known these issues of reliability, but this paper brings them together more sharply,\u201d said Russell Poldrack, the Albert Ray Lang Professor of Psychology at Stanford University, who had a 15-year-old fMRI paper among those that were reanalyzed.\n \u201cThis is a good wakeup call, and it\u2019s a marker of Ahmad\u2019s integrity that he\u2019s taking this on,\u201d said Poldrack, who was not involved in the meta-analysis but said he has had suspicions about fMRI reliability for a few years now.\n Connectivity mapping \u2013 seeing how areas of the brain are connected to address a task more than just what areas are active \u2013 is going to be the way forward, Poldrack predicted. Hariri agreed that identifying patterns of activity throughout the brain rather than in one or two areas may improve reliability.\n In the meantime, the sociology behind a dramatic debunking of a scientific tool is going to be interesting to watch, Hariri and Poldrack both said.\n \u201cThere\u2019s three things you can do,\u201d Poldrack said. \u201cYou can just up and quit, you can stick your head in the sand (and act as if nothing has changed), or you can dig in and try to solve the problems.\u201d\n This analysis was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation.

It highlighted how it can surface in atypical symptoms such as anger. I learned to recognise and work on my own anxiety. It also lead me to recognise anxiety in others. Soon I realised this does not only affect other people but also organisations and processes. Let me introduce you to anxiety driven development.\n   Fear and anxiety produce similar responses. Fear is based on a concrete threat. Whereas anxiety is fuzzier and more vague. Fear driven development is graspable which makes it easier to talk about it.\n As an engineer it could look like this: You\u2019re afraid of pushing your code because you could break the build. Or you shy away of touching a method because you fear shipping a bug.\n If you are a product manager you might try to squeeze that extra feature into a release because you fear that you won\u2019t be able to close a new customer otherwise.\n  But anxiety runs deeper than this. Anxiety becomes more of an underlying current. Here are the most common anxiety driven development patterns I have observed,\n  Your product is driven by the fear of losing. Losing market share, customers or ratings. You are driven to keep up with whatever the competition does. So you go out of your way to get every feature built that your competitors ship.\n As a product manager you might push a feature request to the top of the backlog with every release announcements of your competitors. You can even call that  agile because you\u2019re adapting to change quickly, right? Unfortunately what you\u2019re doing is destabilising your development flow and hinder the long term success of your product. You will always be at least one step behind, always trying to close the gap. This will choke all innovation because who has time to take additional risks when you\u2019re barely keeping pace?\n  Play to win instead. The treatment for this form of anxiety is to  develop a strong unique selling proposition (USP). If you can differentiate yourself from your competition you will not be reeled into the fruitless thought pattern of  playing not to lose. Do not try to differentiate yourself by price alone. This is a very weak USP, just waiting for the next competitor to undercut you, speeding up the race to the bottom. Also it creates almost  no customer loyality.\n  If you\u2019re anxious your business is falling behind but you can\u2019t quite pinpoint why you will act in a continued state of emergency. You will chase quick wins. This might calm the the anxiety for a moment but it won\u2019t last long. It\u2019s possible to make a team stay late or rally the whole company behind you for an initiative. Once. But the more often you cry wolf the less likely it is you get the desired response. If your body is being continuously flooded with stress hormones it will render it incapable of responding to stressful situations adequately. The same goes for your organisation.\n If you push your team every quarter to add a last minute feature for the opportunity of a featuring in a prominent partner store your team will anticipate this and instead already create buffers beforehand. The emergency response will create a fatigue which will appear in the form of demotivation, inflated estimates and non-commitment. All of this hurts the true output, fuelling your anxiety even more.\n  To break out of such a vicious circle  practice saying no. Take a step back and craft an inspiring, authentic vision. Let this vision influence an  actionable strategy. You can then break your strategy down into a  rolling wave plan with more details of the near future. This gives you clarity on the current work while not losing the bigger picture. Ultimately you will be less swayed to jump onto every potential  quick win.\n  Anxiety can make you feel out of control. What\u2019s a natural response to this? You try everything to regain control. But that perceived control can in truth be an overly bureaucratic process which slows down your product development, once again feeding your anxiety.\n How could that look like? You might be creating or working on tickets that resemble a full-blown requirements sheet, specified to the very last detail. At the same time every idea has to go through various stages of approval (until it\u2019s rejected). This is  extremely damaging for motivation.\n  To get out of such anxiety driven behaviours you need trust. Trust your own market research and strategy. And most of all trust your team. Empower the team to be the experts to achieve the product\u2019s vision and let them self organise.\n  Anxiety is widespread and on the rise,  not just during a pandemic.

This is the highest monthly average value ever recorded, and is up from 414.7 ppm in May of last year.\n    Carbon dioxide levels are now the  highest they\u2019ve been in human history, and  likely the highest in 3 million years. The last time there was this much CO2 in the atmosphere, global average surface temperatures were  significantly warmer than they are today, and sea levels were 50 to 80 feet higher.\n  The continuing rise in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere may sound surprising in light of recent findings that the coronavirus pandemic, and the associated lockdowns, had led to a  steep drop in global greenhouse gas emissions, peaking at a 17 percent decline in early April.\n    But the total amount of CO2 that winds up in the atmosphere is driven not only by human emission levels, but also through processes on the land surface (especially forests) and in the oceans that fluctuate on a yearly basis.\n  According to a Scripps news release announcing the findings, CO2 emissions reductions on the order of 20 to 30 percent would need to be sustained for six to 12 months in order for the increase in atmospheric CO2 to slow in a detectable way.\n  \u201cThe buildup of CO2 is a bit like trash in a landfill. As we keep emitting, it keeps piling up,\u201d said Ralph Keeling, who directs  Scripps\u2019 carbon dioxide monitoring program, and whose late father, Charles David Keeling, began measurements at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii in 1958.\n  \u201cThe crisis has slowed emissions, but not enough to show up perceptibly at Mauna Loa. What will matter much more is the trajectory we take coming out of this situation,\u201d he said.\n    In the 1960s, the annual growth rate was about 0.8 ppm per year. It doubled in the 1980s, and eventually climbed to 2.4 ppm per year during the last decade. Multiple lines of evidence show the cause of this increase is greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, said Pieter Tans, who leads NOAA\u2019s Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases Group.\n    The Scripps researchers found that the average atmospheric CO2 concentration for May 2020 was 417.16 parts per million. Using different calculations than the Scripps team, NOAA researchers found the peak monthly value was slightly lower, at 417.1 ppm.\n  The annual high typically occurs in May before CO2 levels temporarily ebb as trees and plants in the Northern Hemisphere absorb vast quantities of the planet-warming gas during the summer growing season. Though CO2 levels exhibit a seasonal cycle, the overall upward trend is clear.\n  The rate of increase from last May to this May was slower than it was in the comparable to 2018 to 2019 period, but natural factors such as El Ni\u00f1o events in the tropical Pacific Ocean and changes in terrestrial carbon sinks, such as forests, can have a large influence on this from year to year, Tans said.\n    El Ni\u00f1o events can contribute to drought and extreme heat in large areas of the world, Tans says, noting they can weaken the ability of forests and other lands to soak up carbon dioxide, leading to a higher natural contribution to atmospheric CO2 levels.\n  The combination of record fossil fuel use and mild El Ni\u00f1o conditions between May 2018 and 2019 can explain the above average increase in atmospheric CO2 of 3.5 ppm that year.\n  Wildfires and deforestation can add to the increase in atmospheric CO2 as well, though their influence ultimately is overwhelmed by the global burning of fossil fuels.\n  According to Rob Jackson, an emissions expert with Stanford University and the Global Carbon Project, emissions from wildfires were up in 2019 and 2020, contributing to the May peak, as was Brazil\u2019s land emissions due to deforestation and  burning.\n    This year\u2019s May CO2 peak marked an increase of about 2.4 ppm compared to a year ago. The 2010 to 2019 average rate of increase is precisely the same at 2.4 ppm per year, according to NOAA. The decline of El Ni\u00f1o over the last year may help explain why the increase in the past year was not as large as the previous, Tans said.\n  Because atmospheric levels of CO2 are cumulative, they will continue to increase until net emissions are cut to zero. They will not decrease until human activities and natural ecosystems are removing more greenhouse gases than is going into the air.\n  Molecules of CO2, a global warming agent, can remain in the atmosphere for up to 1,000 years.\n  Scientists warn that we\u2019re on course to reach 450 ppm by mid-century, where levels would need to stop increasing to have a decent chance of meeting the goals in the Paris climate agreement, which seeks to limit climate change to well below 3.6 degrees (2 Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2100.\n  Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech, says the new findings underscore the need to act now. \u201cIt is a reminder that climate change is not on pause in any way, shape or form,\u201d she said.\n  Keeling says it would take a sustained drop in emissions, rather than a sudden decline related to the coronavirus pandemic, to show up more clearly in measurements of atmospheric CO2. \u201cWhat really matters here is setting a new trajectory,\u201d he said.\n  Jackson, who conducted the  analysis of emissions declines due to the pandemic with colleagues from the Global Carbon Project, said the new findings are not surprising given how the planet\u2019s carbon cycle works.\n  \u201cThis result is disappointing but expected in an atmosphere that is both big and variable,\u201d he said via email.\n  \u201cWe estimated that fossil carbon emissions dropped 8 percent [during] January through April, from 12 billion metric tons in 2019 to 11 billion in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cA billion tons is a lot, but not so much that we can find it with statistical confidence in a noisy signal.\u201d\n  It\u2019s important not to take the wrong message from the current finding, Jackson emphasized. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that the effect of covid-19 on emissions is trivial or that climate progress is impossible. It isn\u2019t. Short-term changes in anything are hard to detect in something as big as the atmosphere.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-06-04 21:02:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u5386\u53f2,co2", "title": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0e\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6392\u653e\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u5730\u7403\u7684\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u6c34\u5e73\u4ecd\u521b\u5386\u53f2\u65b0\u9ad8", "title_en": "Earth\u2019s CO2 levels hit record high, despite coronavirus-related emissions drop", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/06/04/carbon-dioxide-record-2020/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u5386\u53f2", "co2"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cab943ace0215078601f94b587988acc.png", "infoid": 1005138, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\n\n\n\n\n", "note_en": "Now, more than ever, citizens must be able to hold those in power accountable and inspire others through the act of protest.\n Protecting your electronic devices and digital  assets  before, during, and after a protest is vital to keeping yourself and your information safe, as well as getting your message out. Theft, damage, confiscation, or forced deletion of media can disrupt your ability to publish your experiences. At the same time, those engaging in protest may be subject to search or arrest, or have their movements and associations mapped. They could become targets of surveillance and repression.\n There are risks associated with attending a protest, and taking steps to mitigate them can go a long way in ensuring you\u2014and the  data  you value\u2014are kept safe. This guide outlines steps you can take before, during, and after a protest that will help maximize your effectiveness and keep yourself and your data more secure.\n Remember that these tips are general suggestions for better data security and do not constitute legal advice or counseling. If you have specific legal concerns, seek the advice of a licensed attorney.\n  \u00a0     Full-disk encryption ensures that the files across your entire device are encrypted. This is a form of encryption that protects  data  at rest\u2014not to be confused with \u201cin-transit encryption,\u201d which protects data that is transferred over the Internet. Full-disk encryption can help protect everything from your local database of text messages to the passwords stored in your browser. If your device is confiscated by police, or if it is lost or stolen, full-disk encryption can help protect the data stored on your device. Protest situations are often unpredictable, so losing your phone is a distinct possibility.\n Android and  iOS have long required full-disk encryption capabilities to be built into devices. These should be protected by a strong  password : 8-12 random characters that are easy to remember and type in when you unlock your device. If devices are not protected by a strong password, the encryption may be easier to break using a  brute-force attack.  The iPhone 5s and later have specialized hardware to protect against this type of  attack , but a complex, strong password is still the best practice.\n It is important to note that encrypting your device will likely not  encrypt  external storage media such as SD or flash memory cards. You have to encrypt these separately, and may not be able to encrypt them at all. You might want to investigate where files are stored on your device using a file browsing app, or remove external storage media from your device altogether.\n In addition, many digital cameras lack the ability to encrypt. It is safe to assume that photos and videos taken with digital cameras will be stored unencrypted, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n  Today, both iOS and Android allow users to unlock (and  decrypt ) their devices with their fingerprint, and the iPhone X\u2019s FaceID allows users to do the same with facial recognition. While these settings may seem appealing as convenient ways to enjoy the benefits of full-disk encryption, enabling them means an officer could physically force you to unlock your device with your fingerprint or face. In protest situations in particular\u2014or in any other situation in which you may be more likely to encounter a government demand to search your phone (such as at a border crossing)\u2014we suggest you  turn this functionality off.\n In the U.S., using a biometric\u2014like your face scan or fingerprint\u2014to unlock your phone may compromise protections for the contents of your phone afforded to you under the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled incrimination. A police officer may try to intimidate you into \u201cconsenting\u201d to unlock your phone, whether you use a biometric or a memorized passcode. But if you exercise your right to refuse and biometric unlocking functionality is turned on, an officer may physically force you to biometrically unlock your device. Under current U.S. law\u2014which is still in flux\u2014using a memorized passcode generally provides a stronger legal footing to push back in court against compelled device unlocking/decryption. While EFF continues to fight against attempts by law enforcement to compel people to decrypt their devices, there is currently less protection against compelled face and fingerprint unlocking than there is against compelled password disclosure.\n In iOS, you can disable this by going into Settings -&gt; Touch ID &amp; Passcode (or Settings -&gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode, depending on your iPhone version) and removing each of the fingerprints, or tapping Reset Face ID in this menu.\n In Android, disabling this feature may depend on your device manufacturer. For Pixel devices, go into Settings -&gt; Security -&gt; Pixel Imprint and delete the fingerprints from this menu.\n  Signal is an app available on both  iOS and  Android that offers strong encryption to protect both text messages and voice calls. This type of protection is called  end-to-end encryption , which secures your communications in transit.\n In addition to encrypting one-to-one communication, Signal enables encrypted group chats. The app also recently added the functionality of having messages disappear anywhere from 10 seconds to a week after they are first read. In contrast to some other services like SnapChat, these ephemeral messages will never be stored on any server, and are removed from your device after disappearing.\n In 2016, a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia  issued a subpoena to Open Whisper Systems, the developers of Signal. Because of the architecture of Signal, which limits the user  metadata  stored on the company\u2019s servers, the only data they were able to provide was &#34;the date and time a user registered with Signal and the last date of a user&#39;s connectivity to the Signal service.&#34;\n In the context of a protest, you might send relevant photos and videos to friends who are remote using Signal, so that if your phone is confiscated you have a way to retrieve the media later.\n  Take precautions to limit the potential costs of losing access to your device, whether it\u2019s lost, stolen or confiscated by law enforcement. Back up your data regularly and store that backup in a safe place to save yourself from a headache later on.\n  In the United States, federal regulation does not require you to show your ID to purchase a prepaid  SIM card  (but your state might). Most countries require you to provide a form of ID to purchase a prepaid SIM card, thus linking the card to your identity and removing the possibility of anonymity.\n If you&#39;re concerned about protecting the data stored on your device, don&#39;t bring it to the protest. Instead, purchase a  prepaid mobile phone. These devices can be purchased along with a SIM card at most large retail stores. Let your friends know your temporary number, and use this to coordinate activities. Remember that the location of mobile devices can be determined by the cell towers they connect to. So, if you don&#39;t want your identity and location known, turn off your prepaid device before going home or anywhere that might reveal your identity. Using GPS should be safe, since GPS is a receiver and does not transmit any information. However, keep in mind that your device may store your coordinates. For this reason, we suggest you  turn off  location services before you travel to the protest, and leave it off until you return. Turning off location services may make it difficult to navigate if you are not familiar with the route to and from the protest. You may want to download a local copy of the area map you will be traveling in.\n When you&#39;re done with the phone, it can be safely recycled or discarded from a location that is not linked to you. Keep in mind that if you carry both your regular device and a prepaid one with you, the location of these devices can be correlated and compromise your anonymity.\n  Many law enforcement agencies have access to sophisticated surveillance technology that can be used to identify people attending a protest. To protect yourself, it\u2019s important to dress in ways that preserve your anonymity and protect your physical safety.\n  Wearing the same clothing as everyone in your group can help hide your identity during the protest and keep you from being identified and tracked afterwards. This not only helps preserve your anonymity, but also protects your fellow protestors from being identified and surveilled as well. Dressing in dark, monochrome colors will help you blend into a crowd. Be aware that you may not be as visible to cars in the dark, and should take extra precaution when crossing streets or walking near moving vehicles.\n If you are able, bring a change of clothes for after the protest is over. You may be exposed to irritants such as pepper spray or tear gas during the protest, and it\u2019s wise to change into clothing that won\u2019t cause discomfort or harm on your return journey.\n  If you have visible tattoos or bright unconventional hair colors, cover them up. Tattoos can be used to identify you later, and may be added to databases for  tattoo recognition. Dark monochrome hats, scarves, gloves, long sleeves, and full-length clothing will help cover these identifying features so you blend more easily into a crowd.\n  Wear a mask! It will help protect you from airborne illnesses, face recognition technologies, and being identified in photos of the protest after it ends. Goggles are also useful for keeping your eyes safe from projectiles or irritants, and tinted ones may be useful for circumventing face recognition systems (but this strategy is not foolproof). Gloves will help protect your hands from irritants and contact with infectious diseases. If you are able to use medical gloves, use nitrile instead of latex gloves, as some people have latex allergies. Note that gloves will interfere with some phone functions. We also recommend wearing sturdy shoes that are comfortable to move around in for extended periods of time.\n  \u00a0     Catching that perfect image is something you want to be ready for, and powerful images can help support your cause. If you&#39;ve chosen a strong  password , entering it into the device takes precious time, and you  risk  the moment passing before you&#39;re able to take the picture. Luckily, iOS and Android allow you to take photos and videos without unlocking your device.\n At the iOS lock screen, you can firmly press on the camera icon. Older iOS devices require you to swipe.\n  If you are taking photos or videos of people at the protest, be mindful of what you post. If you post photos online where protestors or bystanders\u2019 faces are identifiable, law enforcement or vigilantes might track them down and arrest or harass them. Consider obscuring the faces of anyone who has their eyes or mouth visible. You can edit photos in the default Android or iOS photo editing apps. Be sure to black out or blur other identifying features as well such as tattoos or unique clothing (blurring can sometimes be reversed so blacking out is better if you have the option). On Android, consider using the  ObscuraCam app by The Guardian Project to edit photos, which will automatically blur faces. There is also a useful tool called  Image Scrubber that can be used on any mobile device, including iOS or your PC.\n  Once you are ready to post your photos, it\u2019s a  good idea to scrub the metadata contained in the image files if you don&#39;t want to leak personally identifying information. Metadata on photos can include information such as the model of camera the photo was taken on, the exact time and location where the photo was taken, and even your name.\n Option 1: Remove any original photo metadata by transferring the photo onto a desktop computer, taking a screenshot of the image, and posting the screenshot instead of the original photo.\n Option 2: You can also take a screenshot of the photo on your mobile device to remove the metadata, but the image quality may not be as high. You can then post that screenshot instead of the original photo.\n Option 3: Send yourself a copy of the photo via the Signal app (which strips metadata when sending images), then download the sent image for posting.\n   Automated License Plate Reader Systems (ALPRs) automatically record the license plates of cars driving through an area, along with the exact time, date, and location they were encountered. This technology is often used by law enforcement in the United States and many other countries, or employed by private companies such as  Vigilant and  MVTrac who then share license plate  data  with law enforcement and other entities. Amassed in huge databases, this data is retained for lengthy periods of time. These companies have lobbied and  litigated vigorously against statutes that would ban the private collection of license plate data or otherwise regulate ALPRs. Essentially, your location can be tracked over time based on the driving history of any car registered to you, with very few legal limits in place as to how this data can be collected, accessed, shared, and retained.\n   Be careful when traveling to and from the protest location. If you\u2019re using payment methods or transit cards that are linked to you, law enforcement may be able to determine you attended the protest and track your movements. Consider using alternative means of public transportation if you would prefer that your movements and associations remain private.\n If you are able, consider biking or walking to and from the protest to minimize exposure to these types of surveillance risks.\n  Airplane mode ensures that your device will not be transmitting for the duration of your time at the protest, and prevents your location from being tracked. Unfortunately, this also means that you won&#39;t be able to message or call your friends, so plan accordingly. Before going to the protest, agree on a spot where you and your friends can meet if you get separated. As mentioned earlier in this guide, you may also want to turn off location services before you travel to the protest, and leave it off until you return.\n Some apps allow you to navigate without having network access. Since GPS is a receive-only system, you can selectively turn GPS on after enabling airplane mode. Be sure to download a map of the area of the protest beforehand.\n  If you are detained and questioned by police, you have a right to remain silent, and to speak with an attorney before and during any questioning. It is best to say \u201cI want my attorney and I choose to remain silent\u201d and then refuse to answer questions until you have a chance to talk to a lawyer.\n If you answer questions, be sure to tell the truth. It is a crime to lie to a police officer and you may find yourself in more trouble for lying to law enforcement than for whatever it was they wanted to talk to you about in the first place.\n If the police ask to see your phone, you can tell them that you do  not consent to a search of your device. They might respond by seizing your phone and trying to search it later, but at least it will be clear that you did not give them permission to do so.\n If the police ask for the password to unlock your electronic device (or ask you to unlock it directly), you can refuse. You may suffer adverse consequences at the hands of law enforcement\u2014from having your phone seized to being booked into custody\u2014for refusing to provide your password or biometric  key . Every arrest situation is different, however, and you will need to consider your own  threat model .\n  \u00a0     If your device has been confiscated, you may have legal recourse to get it back. In the U.S., your attorney can file a motion for the return of your property if it is not being held as evidence in a pending case. If the police believe that evidence of a crime was found on your electronic device, including in your photos or videos, then the police can keep it as evidence. They may also attempt to end your ownership of your electronic device, but you can challenge such  asset  forfeiture in court.\n You can also revoke access for some services that are logged in on your device. For instance, on Twitter if you go to Settings and privacy -&gt; Apps and devices, you can revoke access for devices that have permission to connect to your Twitter account. For other services, simply changing your  password  or  passphrase  will prompt the app to log out. But beware that revoking law enforcement access may expose you to the  risk  of being charged with obstruction of justice or the destruction of evidence. You should always speak to your attorney first before deciding how to proceed. Online services may provide logs of recent log-ins for your account. If you are worried your device is being used to access accounts without your consent, it might be useful for you to see if such logs are available and monitor them. If law enforcement confiscates your device, they may use a \u201cforensic\u201d tool such as \u201cCellebrite\u201d to try to extract  data  from your device, such as images, contacts, messages, and location history. This is more likely to be successful if your phone is older or unencrypted. For this reason, it\u2019s important to carry the bare minimum of data with you, and use the strongest level of  encryption , when going into a risky situation like a protest.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 21:00:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6297\u8bae,attending", "title": "\u53c2\u52a0\u6297\u8bae\u6d3b\u52a8", "title_en": "Attending a Protest", "transed": 1, "url": "https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/attending-protest", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6297\u8bae", "attending"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4c65e4aac492e4a2fd3a5c0bfa935e6a.jpg", "infoid": 1005137, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\n\n\n\u636e\u83ab\u65af\u79d1\u7684\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u56e0\u6d89\u5acc\u4fb5\u72af\u4eba\u6743\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u7f8e\u56fd\u5236\u88c1\u7684\u8f66\u81e3\u9886\u5bfc\u4eba\u62c9\u59c6\u8d5e\u00b7\u5361\u5fb7\u7f57\u592b(Ramzan Kadyrov)\u5468\u4e8c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u6b63\u5728\u201c\u6050\u60e7\u5730\u5173\u6ce8\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5c40\u52bf\uff0c\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u5f53\u5c40\u6b63\u5728\u6076\u610f\u4fb5\u72af\u666e\u901a\u516c\u6c11\u7684\u6743\u5229\u201d\u3002", "note_en": "The scenes have been disturbingly familiar to CIA analysts accustomed to monitoring scenes of societal unraveling abroad \u2014 the massing of protesters, the ensuing crackdowns and the awkwardly staged displays of strength by a leader determined to project authority.\n In interviews and posts on social media in recent days, current and former U.S. intelligence officials have expressed dismay at the similarity between events at home and the signs of decline or democratic regression they were trained to detect in other nations.\n \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind of violence,\u201d said Gail Helt, a former CIA analyst responsible for tracking developments in China and Southeast Asia. \u201cThis is what autocrats do. This is what happens in countries before a collapse. It really does unnerve me.\u201d\n  Helt, now a professor at King University in Tennessee, said the images of unrest in U.S. cities, combined with President Trump\u2019s incendiary statements, echo clashes she covered over a dozen years at the CIA tracking developments in China, Malaysia and elsewhere.\n   Marc Polymeropoulos, who formerly ran CIA operations in Europe and Asia, was among several former agency officials who recoiled at images of Trump hoisting a Bible in front of  St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church in Washington after authorities fired rubber bullets and tear gas to clear the president\u2019s path of protesters.\n  \u201cIt reminded me of what I reported on for years in the third world,\u201d Polymeropoulos said on Twitter. Referring to the despotic leaders of Iraq, Syria and Libya, he said: \u201cSaddam. Bashar. Qaddafi. They all did this.\u201d\n The impression Trump created was only reinforced by others in the administration. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper urged governors to \u201cdominate the battlespace\u201d surrounding protesters, as if describing U.S. cities as a foreign war zone. Later, as military helicopters hovered menacingly over protesters, Gen. Mark A.

After seeing tear gas canisters underfoot, he said, he \u201cknew it was time to go\u201d and departed.\n Former intelligence officials said the unrest and the administration\u2019s militaristic response are among many measures of decay they would flag if writing assessments about the United States for another country\u2019s intelligence service.\n   They cited the country\u2019s struggle to contain  the novel coronavirus, the president\u2019s attempt to pressure Ukraine for political favors, his attacks on the news media and the increasingly polarized political climate as other signs of dysfunction.\n Trump supporters have defended his handling of the unrest, and his trip across Lafayette Square as a display of the strength needed to restore order in dozens of cities where protests have led to looting, fires and violence.\n Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker (R) said it was \u201chard to imagine\u201d any other president \u201chaving the guts to walk out of the White House like this.\u201d\n But there were also indications that senior members of the administration were uncomfortable with the president\u2019s outing and eager to minimize their role in it.\n  A senior Pentagon official said Tuesday that neither Esper nor Milley knew when they set out to accompany Trump that police were about to charge through seemingly peaceful protesters or that they would play supporting roles in a photo op.\n  Even away from the cameras, Trump has assiduously cultivated the aura of a strongman. Earlier Monday, he had chided governors as \u201cweak\u201d for failing to employ adequate force in the face of mounting protests.\n \u201cIf you don\u2019t dominate, you\u2019re wasting your time,\u201d Trump said. He offered no words on how to ease tensions in crowds that have massed largely in anger over the death of George Floyd, an African American man who was killed while being pinned to the ground, a knee against his neck, by police in Minneapolis.\n  Brett McGurk, a former top U.S. envoy to the Middle East who spent two years in the Trump administration, said the president\u2019s words \u2014  recorded by participants and shared with news organizations \u2014 would only embolden the world\u2019s autocrats and undermine U.S. authority.\n \u201cThe imagery of a head of state in a call with other governing officials saying, \u2018Dominate the streets, dominate the battlespace\u2019 \u2014 these are iconic images that will define America for some time,\u201d said McGurk, who led U.S. diplomatic efforts to counter the Islamic State terrorist group. \u201cIt makes it much more difficult for us to distinguish ourselves from other countries we are trying to contest\u201d or influence, he said.\n  In recent years, U.S. officials have urged restraint or denounced crackdowns against protesters or vulnerable groups in Russia, Iran, Turkey, Malaysia, Syria and other countries.\n  Even this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lectured  China about its efforts to prevent citizens of Hong Kong from holding a vigil to mark the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests.\n \u201cIf there is any doubt about Beijing\u2019s intent, it is to deny Hong Kongers a voice and a choice,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement that was met with derision on Twitter because it coincided with crackdowns urged by Trump in the United States.\n The seeming hypocrisy in the U.S. position has not been lost on foreign targets of American pressure or criticism.\n Ramzan Kadyrov, a Chechen leader who has faced U.S. sanctions for alleged human rights abuses, said Tuesday that he was \u201cwatching with horror the situation in the United States, where the authorities are maliciously violating ordinary citizens\u2019 rights,\u201d according to  reports from Moscow.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 20:59:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "I should explain what the quote refers to. Microsoft employees are granted stock option grants when they start working there. Actually not all employees, just the programmers and other employees who are deemed worthy. The options vest - become available to be exercised - following a set schedule, so that after 4 1/2 years all of the initial options can be exercised. Since an option allows the employee to buy stock at the price when the option was granted, and the stock generally will have risen in that period of time, the employee can buy the stock cheap and sell it on the open market, pocketing some nice change. So FYIFV would imply that the employee had been there long enough for his or her initial grant to vest, could generate piles of cash in a hurry, and therefore had to answer to no one. For example, the quote above refers to the jubilation felt when Microsoft went public and people started cashing in stock. Well, I guess, although do you really believe that people would wear buttons that in effect said, &#34;I&#39;m richer than you?&#34; Of course, we are talking about Microsoft people, so I can understand why it sounded believable. There&#39;s another reason to doubt it, which is that employees (all employees, nowadays, even those who didn&#39;t get initial grants) are granted more options each year. These are usually less than the initial grant, but still this notion, that after 4 1/2 years the employee has gotten all the option money he or she is going to get, is simply false. Employees are never &#34;fully vested,&#34; because the new option grants are vesting over time also. &#34;Realize that the primary motivator for employees of dominant commercial OS vendors is money (note buttons worn by Microsoft employees that read &#39;FYIFV&#39;, you can search around on the Web yourself to figure out the acronym).&#34; - Chris McDonough, &#34; Countering The No-Support Argument for Linux and Other Open Source Software Offerings&#34; web page. A quote like this one is a little more ominous. Now it is being used to imply that Microsoft employees are money-grubbing individuals and that this attitude extends into their motivation to write software. Someone who wore an FYIFV button is obviously not motivated by any sense of altruism, and merely wants to separate people from their cash as quickly as possible, software quality be damned. &#34;For years, Softies were wont to sport buttons that read FYIFV: Fuck You, I&#39;m Fully Vested.&#34; - John Heileman, &#34; The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth&#34;,  Wired, November 2000. Now you are hitting a bit too close to home. This sentence is in an article about the Justice Department lawsuit about Microsoft (the same quote appears in Heileman&#39;s book,   Pride Before the Fall, based on the  Wired article). The FYIFV button is being used to show that Microsoft employees are basically mean people, capable of anything including illegal monopoly extension. The paragraph leading up to that reads, &#34;Extending a long middle finger to the government and your competitors is not conventional behavior among the top executives of most blue-chip companies. But, of course, Microsoft was different - self-consciously so. Populated by an army of young men (mainly), most of them unusually bright, many of them abnormally wealthy, working endless hours and pulling frequent all-nighters, Microsoft has always retained the air of a fraternity - a fraternity of rich eggheads, but a fraternity nonetheless.&#34; So let me use this article as an attempt to debunk this myth. I received one somewhat definitive email about the origin of the phrase: [Person X] is adamant that he NEVER made or wore an FYIFV button or T-Shirt. The story he tells is that he made a comment to the effect that some person was wearing their FYIFV T-Shirt that day, meaning that that person was being intransigent about something or other. The intended audience apparently understood that this was an entirely metaphorical reference, but someone else, not involved in the conversation, apparently overheard the crack and related it to Bill [Gates], misreporting the story by saying that [Person X] had actually made such a T-Shirt. [Person X] got called onto the carpet for this by Bill, who was skeptical that no such shirts actually existed and that [Person X] wasn&#39;t involved in their making. I had dinner with [Person X] that evening, and remember it well. I only ever saw one actual FYIFV shirt. The person made it themself and wore it only on their final day at MS. This was maybe &#39;92 or so, years after the original incident.\n OK, so someone heard the story themselves and made up ONE shirt as a joke. It was never meant to imply all the things it has been taken to imply. Now I am not claiming that Microsoft is populated by a bunch of saints. They are as obnoxious and egotistical as anyone else, and they certainly do stroll around the hallways in Redmond with some rude T-Shirts and buttons, bearing slogans aimed at various competitors.",

"note_en": "A game-changing technique for imaging molecules known as cryo-electron microscopy has produced its sharpest pictures yet \u2014 and, for the first time, discerned individual atoms in a protein.\n By achieving atomic resolution using cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), researchers will be able to understand, in unprecedented detail, the workings of proteins that cannot easily be examined by other imaging techniques, such as X-ray crystallography.\n The breakthrough, reported by two laboratories late last month, cements cryo-EM\u2019s position as the dominant tool for mapping the 3D shapes of proteins, say scientists. Ultimately, these structures will help researchers to understand how proteins work in health and disease, and lead to better drugs with fewer side effects.\n \u201cIt\u2019s really a milestone, that\u2019s for sure. There\u2019s really nothing to break anymore. This was the last resolution barrier,\u201d says Holger Stark, a biochemist and electron microscopist at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, who led one of the studies  1. The other  2 was led by Sjors Scheres and Radu Aricescu, structural biologists at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC-LMB) in Cambridge, UK. Both were posted on the bioRxiv preprint server on 22 May.\n \u201cTrue \u2018atomic resolution\u2019 is a real milestone,\u201d adds John Rubinstein, a structural biologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. Getting atomic-resolution structures of many proteins will still be a daunting task because of other challenges, such as a protein\u2019s flexibility. &#34;These preprints show where one can get to if those other limitations can be addressed,\u201d he adds.\n  Cryo-EM is a decades-old technique that determines the shape of flash-frozen samples by firing electrons at them and recording the resulting images. Advances in technology for detecting the ricocheting electrons and in image-analysis software catalysed a \u2018resolution revolution\u2019 that started around 2013. This led to protein structures that were sharper than ever before \u2014 and nearly as good as those obtained from X-ray crystallography, an older technique that infers structures from diffraction patterns made by protein crystals when they are bombarded with X-rays.\n Subsequent hardware and software advances led to more improvements in the resolution of cryo-EM structures. But scientists have had to largely rely on X-ray crystallography for obtaining atomic-resolution structures. However, researchers can spend months to years getting a protein to crystallize, and many medically important proteins won\u2019t form usable crystals; cryo-EM, by contrast, requires only that the protein be in a purified solution.\n Atomic-resolution maps are precise enough to unambiguously discern the position of individual atoms in a protein, at a resolution of around 1.2 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms (1.2 \u00d7 10 \u201310 m). These structures are especially useful for understanding how enzymes work and using those insights to identify drugs that can block their activity.\n To push cryo-EM to atomic resolution, the two teams worked on an iron-storing protein called apoferritin. Because of its rock-like stability, the protein has become a test bed for cryo-EM: a structure of the protein with a resolution of 1.54 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms was the previous record  3.\n  The teams then used technological improvements to take sharper pictures of apoferritin. Stark\u2019s team got a 1.25-\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m structure of the protein, with help from an instrument that ensures that the electrons travel at similar speeds before hitting a sample, enhancing the resolution of the resulting images. Scheres, Aricescu and their group used a different technology to fire electrons travelling at similar speeds; they also benefited from a technology that reduces the noise generated after some electrons career off the protein sample, as well as a more sensitive electron-detecting camera. Their 1.2-\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m structure was so complete, says Scheres, that they could pick out individual hydrogen atoms, both in the protein and in surrounding water molecules.\n Stark reckons that melding the technologies could push resolutions to around 1 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m \u2014 but not much further. \u201cBelow 1 \u00c5 is almost impossible to reach for cryo-EM,\u201d he says. Obtaining such a structure with existing state-of-the-art technology would take \u201cseveral hundred years of data recording and a non-realistic amount of compute power and data-storage capacities\u201d, his team estimates.\n  Scheres and Aricescu also tested their improvements on a simplified form of a protein called GABA A receptor. The protein sits in the membrane of neurons and is a target for general anaesthetics, anxiety medications and many other drugs. Last year, Aricescu\u2019s team used cryo-EM to map the protein to 2.5 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms  4. But with the new kit, the researchers attained a 1.7-\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m resolution, with even better resolution in some key parts of the protein. \u201cIt was like peeling off a blur over your eyes,\u201d Aricescu says. \u201cAt this resolution, every half \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m opens up a whole universe.\u201d\n The structure revealed never-before-seen details in the protein \u2014 including the water molecules in the pocket where a chemical called histamine sits. \u201cThat is a gold mine for structure-based drug design,\u201d says Aricescu, because it shows how a drug could displace the water molecules, potentially resulting in medications with fewer side effects.\n An atomic-resolution map of GABA A, which isn\u2019t as stable as apoferritin, would be a challenge, says Scheres. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible, but it would be very impractical,\u201d because of the vast amount of data that would need to be collected. But other improvements, particularly in how protein samples are prepared, could pave the way for atomic-resolution structures of GABA A and other biomedically important proteins. Protein solutions are frozen on tiny grids made of gold, and alterations to these grids could hold proteins even stiller  5.\n \u201cEveryone is very excited and amazed by the truly astounding level of performance demonstrated by the MRC-LMB and Max Planck groups,\u201d says Radostin Danev, a cryo-EM specialist at the University of Tokyo. But he agrees that sample preparation is the field\u2019s major challenge for more wobbly proteins. \u201cSub-1.5-\u00c5, or even sub-2-\u00c5, resolution performance will remain accessible for some time to only well-behaved samples,\u201d he says.\n The breakthroughs are likely to cement cryo-EM\u2019s position as the go-to tool for most structural studies, says Scheres. Drug companies, which covet atomic-resolution structures, might be even more likely to turn to cryo-EM. But Stark thinks X-ray crystallography will retain some appeal. If a protein can be crystallized \u2014 and that\u2019s a big if \u2014 it\u2019s relatively efficient to generate structures of it bound to thousands of potential drugs in a short amount of time. But it can still take hours to days to generate enough data for extremely high-resolution cryo-EM structures.\n \u201cThere are still pros and cons for each of the techniques,\u201d says Stark. \u201cPeople have published lots of papers and reviews that say these latest advances in cryo-EM will be the death signal for X-ray.

While most Americans \u2013 70% in a  recent Pew Research Center survey \u2013 say high turnout in presidential elections is very important, what constitutes \u201chigh turnout\u201d depends very much on which country you\u2019re looking at and which measuring stick you use.\n  The  Census Bureau\u00a0estimated that there were 245.5 million Americans ages 18 and older in November 2016, about 157.6 million of whom reported being registered to vote. (While political scientists typically define turnout as votes cast divided by the number of  eligible voters, in practice turnout calculations usually are based on the estimated voting-age population, or VAP.) Just over 137.5 million people told the census they voted in 2016, somewhat higher than the actual number of votes tallied \u2013 nearly 136.8 million, according to figures compiled by the  Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives, though that figure includes more than 170,000 blank, spoiled or otherwise null ballots. That sort of overstatement has long been noted by  researchers; the comparisons and charts in this analysis use the House Clerk\u2019s figure, along with data from\u00a0the\u00a0 International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance\u00a0(IDEA) and individual nations\u2019 statistical and elections authorities.\n The 55.7% VAP turnout in 2016 puts the U.S. behind most of its peers in\u00a0the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u00a0(OECD), most of whose members are highly developed, democratic states. Looking at the most recent nationwide election in each OECD nation, the U.S. placed 26th out of 32 (current VAP estimates weren\u2019t available for three countries).\n   The highest turnout rates among OECD nations were in Belgium (87.2%), Sweden (82.6%) and Denmark (80.3%). Switzerland consistently has the lowest turnout in the OECD: In 2015, less than 39% of the Swiss voting-age population cast ballots for the federal legislature.\n One factor behind Belgium\u2019s high turnout rates \u2013 between 83% and 95% of VAP in every election for the past four decades \u2013 may be that it is one of the 24 nations around the world (and six\u00a0in the OECD) with some form of compulsory voting, according to IDEA.\u00a0(One canton in Switzerland, also an OECD member nation, has compulsory voting.)\n While  compulsory-voting\u00a0laws aren\u2019t always strictly enforced, their presence or absence can have dramatic impacts on turnout. In Chile, for example, turnout plunged after the country moved from compulsory to voluntary voting in 2012 and began automatically enrolling eligible citizens. Even though essentially all voting-age citizens were registered for Chile\u2019s 2013 elections, turnout in the presidential race plunged to 42%, versus 87% in 2010 when the compulsory-voting law was still in place. (Turnout rebounded slightly in last year\u2019s presidential election, to 49% of registered voters.)\n Chile\u2019s situation points to yet another complicating factor when comparing turnout rates across countries: the distinction between who\u2019s eligible to vote and who\u2019s actually registered to do so. In many countries, the government takes the lead\u00a0in getting people\u2019s names\u00a0on the rolls \u2013 whether by registering them automatically once they become eligible\u00a0(as in, for example, Sweden or Germany) or by aggressively seeking out and registering eligible voters (as in the UK and Australia). As a result, turnout looks pretty similar regardless of whether you\u2019re looking at voting-age population or registered voters.\n  In the U.S., by contrast, registration is mainly an individual responsibility. And\u00a0registered voters represent a much smaller share of potential voters in the U.S. than just about any other OECD country. Only about 64% of the U.S. voting-age population (and 70% of voting-age  citizens) was\u00a0registered in 2016, according to the Census Bureau report, compared with 91% in Canada (2015) and the UK (2017), 96% in Sweden (2014), and 99% in Slovakia (2016).\n As a consequence, turnout comparisons\u00a0based only on registered voters may not be very meaningful. For instance, U.S. turnout in 2016 was 86.8% of registered voters, fourth-highest among OECD countries (and highest among those without compulsory voting). But\u00a0registered voters in the U.S. are much more of a self-selected group, already more likely to vote because they took the trouble to register themselves.\n There are even\u00a0more ways to calculate turnout. Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who runs the United States Election Project,\u00a0 estimates turnout as a share of the \u201cvoting- eligible population\u201d by subtracting noncitizens and ineligible felons from the voting-age population and adding eligible overseas voters. Using those calculations, U.S. turnout improves somewhat, to  59.3% of the 2016 voting-eligible population. However, McDonald doesn\u2019t calculate comparable estimates for other countries.\n No matter how they\u2019re measured, U.S. turnout rates have been fairly consistent over the past several decades, despite some election-to-election variation. Since 1976, voting-age turnout has remained within an 8.5-percentage-point range \u2013 from just under 50% in 1996,\u00a0when\u00a0Bill Clinton was re-elected, to just over 58% in 2008, when Barack Obama won the White House. However, turnout  varies considerably\u00a0among different racial, ethnic and age groups.\n In several other OECD countries, turnout has drifted lower in recent decades. Greece, which has a compulsory-voting law on the books (though it\u2019s not enforced), saw turnout in parliamentary elections fall from 89% in 2000 to 62% in September 2015. In Norway\u2019s parliamentary elections last year, 70.6% of the voting-age population cast ballots \u2013 the lowest turnout rate in at least four decades. And in Slovenia, after a burst of enthusiasm following the country\u2019s independence from Yugoslavia in 1992 (when 85% of the voting-age population cast ballots),\u00a0turnout fell rapidly \u2013 sinking to\u00a054% in 2014,\u00a0a drop of 31 percentage points in just over two decades of democracy.\n On the other hand, turnout in recent elections has bumped up in several OECD countries. In Hungary\u2019s parliamentary elections this past April, nearly 72% of the voting-age population voted, up from 63.3% in 2014. In the Netherlands, turnout rose from 71% in 2012 to 77.3% in March 2017. And turnout inched above 69% in September 2017\u2019s German parliamentary election \u2013 the highest level since 2005.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 19:09:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9009\u6c11,developed", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5728\u9009\u6c11\u6295\u7968\u7387(2018\u5e74)\u65b9\u9762\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53d1\u8fbe\u56fd\u5bb6", "title_en": "U.S. trails most developed countries in voter turnout (2018)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9009\u6c11", "developed"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8da241e2c9c333ebe78312735cbd4263.jpg", "infoid": 1005133, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728385\u4f8b\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c237\u4f8b\u5df2\u7ecf\u51fa\u9662\uff0c\u8be5\u5e02\u53ea\u6709136\u4eba\u6b63\u5728\u63a5\u53d7\u75c5\u6bd2\u6cbb\u7597\u3002", "note_en": "Out of the 385 cases, 237 have discharged, and the city has to only 136 people under treatment for the virus.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 19:09:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65b0\u51a0,bangalore", "title": "\u73ed\u52a0\u7f57\u5c14\u67091200\u4e07\u5c45\u6c11\uff0c\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\u75c5\u4f8b\u53ea\u6709385\u4f8b", "title_en": "Bangalore has 12M residents and only 385 Covid-19 cases", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.thequint.com/news/india/coronavirus-for-a-population-of-12-crore-why-bengaluru-has-only-300-covid-cases", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65b0\u51a0", "bangalore"]}]
