it&#39;s possible to predict an individual\u2019s patterns of thoughts and feelings by scanning their brain in an MRI machine as they perform some mental tasks.\n But a new analysis by some of the researchers who have done the most work in this area finds that those measurements are highly suspect when it comes to drawing conclusions about any individual person\u2019s brain.\n Watching the brain through a functional MRI machine (fMRI) is still great for finding the general brain structures involved in a given task across a group of people, said Ahmad Hariri, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University who led the reanalysis.\n \u201cScanning 50 people is going to accurately reveal what parts of the brain, on average, are more active during a mental task, like counting or remembering names,\u201d Hariri said\n Functional MRI measures blood flow as a proxy for brain activity. It shows where blood is being sent in the brain, presumably because neurons in that area are more active during a mental task.\n The problem is that the level of activity for any given person probably won\u2019t be the same twice, and a measure that changes every time it is collected cannot be applied to predict anyone\u2019s future mental health or behavior.\n Hariri and his colleagues reexamined 56 published papers based on fMRI data to gauge their reliability across 90 experiments. Hariri said the researchers recognized that \u201cthe correlation between one scan and a second is not even fair, it\u2019s poor.\u201d\n They also examined data from the brain-scanning Human Connectome Project -- \u201cOur field\u2019s Bible at the moment,\u201d Hariri called it -- and looked at test/retest results for 45 individuals. For six out of seven measures of brain function, the correlation between tests taken about four months apart with the same person was weak. The seventh measure studied, language processing, was only a fair correlation, not good or excellent.\n Finally they looked at data they collected through the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study in New Zealand, in which 20 individuals were put through task-based fMRI twice, two or three months apart. Again, they found poor correlation from one test to the next in an individual.\n The bottom line is that task-based fMRI in its current form can\u2019t tell you what an individual\u2019s brain activation will look like from one test to the next, Hariri said. The new analysis, appears June 3 in Psychological Science\n \u201cThis is more relevant to my work than just about anyone else\u2019s!\u201d Hariri said, his voice rising. \u201cThis is my fault. I\u2019m going to throw myself under the bus. This whole sub-branch of fMRI could go extinct if we can\u2019t address this critical limitation.\u201d\n Hariri has been using fMRI data as part of a long-term study of 1,300 undergraduate Duke students. By combining brain scans, genetic testing and psychological assessments, Hariri is searching for biomarkers of individual differences in the way people process thoughts and emotions, such as why one person comes away from a traumatic event with PTSD or depression and another does not.\n \u201cWe can\u2019t continue with the same old \u2018hot spot\u2019 research,\u201d Hariri said. \u201cWe could scan the same 1,300 undergrads again and we wouldn\u2019t see the same patterns for each of them.\u201d\n One possible solution to the reliability problem, using existing technology, would be to collect data for a full hour or longer in the scanner, not just five minutes. Hariri also said developing new tasks from the ground up with the explicit purpose of reliably measuring individual differences in brain activity is another strategy. In the meanwhile, Hariri and his team have shifted their focus to MRI measures of brain structure, which are highly reliable.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t known these issues of reliability, but this paper brings them together more sharply,\u201d said Russell Poldrack, the Albert Ray Lang Professor of Psychology at Stanford University, who had a 15-year-old fMRI paper among those that were reanalyzed.\n \u201cThis is a good wakeup call, and it\u2019s a marker of Ahmad\u2019s integrity that he\u2019s taking this on,\u201d said Poldrack, who was not involved in the meta-analysis but said he has had suspicions about fMRI reliability for a few years now.\n Connectivity mapping \u2013 seeing how areas of the brain are connected to address a task more than just what areas are active \u2013 is going to be the way forward, Poldrack predicted. Hariri agreed that identifying patterns of activity throughout the brain rather than in one or two areas may improve reliability.\n In the meantime, the sociology behind a dramatic debunking of a scientific tool is going to be interesting to watch, Hariri and Poldrack both said.\n \u201cThere\u2019s three things you can do,\u201d Poldrack said. \u201cYou can just up and quit, you can stick your head in the sand (and act as if nothing has changed), or you can dig in and try to solve the problems.\u201d\n This analysis was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation.

It highlighted how it can surface in atypical symptoms such as anger. I learned to recognise and work on my own anxiety. It also lead me to recognise anxiety in others. Soon I realised this does not only affect other people but also organisations and processes. Let me introduce you to anxiety driven development.\n   Fear and anxiety produce similar responses. Fear is based on a concrete threat. Whereas anxiety is fuzzier and more vague. Fear driven development is graspable which makes it easier to talk about it.\n As an engineer it could look like this: You\u2019re afraid of pushing your code because you could break the build. Or you shy away of touching a method because you fear shipping a bug.\n If you are a product manager you might try to squeeze that extra feature into a release because you fear that you won\u2019t be able to close a new customer otherwise.\n  But anxiety runs deeper than this. Anxiety becomes more of an underlying current. Here are the most common anxiety driven development patterns I have observed,\n  Your product is driven by the fear of losing. Losing market share, customers or ratings. You are driven to keep up with whatever the competition does. So you go out of your way to get every feature built that your competitors ship.\n As a product manager you might push a feature request to the top of the backlog with every release announcements of your competitors. You can even call that  agile because you\u2019re adapting to change quickly, right? Unfortunately what you\u2019re doing is destabilising your development flow and hinder the long term success of your product. You will always be at least one step behind, always trying to close the gap. This will choke all innovation because who has time to take additional risks when you\u2019re barely keeping pace?\n  Play to win instead. The treatment for this form of anxiety is to  develop a strong unique selling proposition (USP). If you can differentiate yourself from your competition you will not be reeled into the fruitless thought pattern of  playing not to lose. Do not try to differentiate yourself by price alone. This is a very weak USP, just waiting for the next competitor to undercut you, speeding up the race to the bottom. Also it creates almost  no customer loyality.\n  If you\u2019re anxious your business is falling behind but you can\u2019t quite pinpoint why you will act in a continued state of emergency. You will chase quick wins. This might calm the the anxiety for a moment but it won\u2019t last long. It\u2019s possible to make a team stay late or rally the whole company behind you for an initiative. Once. But the more often you cry wolf the less likely it is you get the desired response. If your body is being continuously flooded with stress hormones it will render it incapable of responding to stressful situations adequately. The same goes for your organisation.\n If you push your team every quarter to add a last minute feature for the opportunity of a featuring in a prominent partner store your team will anticipate this and instead already create buffers beforehand. The emergency response will create a fatigue which will appear in the form of demotivation, inflated estimates and non-commitment. All of this hurts the true output, fuelling your anxiety even more.\n  To break out of such a vicious circle  practice saying no. Take a step back and craft an inspiring, authentic vision. Let this vision influence an  actionable strategy. You can then break your strategy down into a  rolling wave plan with more details of the near future. This gives you clarity on the current work while not losing the bigger picture. Ultimately you will be less swayed to jump onto every potential  quick win.\n  Anxiety can make you feel out of control. What\u2019s a natural response to this? You try everything to regain control. But that perceived control can in truth be an overly bureaucratic process which slows down your product development, once again feeding your anxiety.\n How could that look like? You might be creating or working on tickets that resemble a full-blown requirements sheet, specified to the very last detail. At the same time every idea has to go through various stages of approval (until it\u2019s rejected). This is  extremely damaging for motivation.\n  To get out of such anxiety driven behaviours you need trust. Trust your own market research and strategy. And most of all trust your team. Empower the team to be the experts to achieve the product\u2019s vision and let them self organise.\n  Anxiety is widespread and on the rise,  not just during a pandemic. It would be naive to believe that this does not also affect your workplace. Anxiety driven product development is hard to crack because it sustains itself. Take a step back and reflect on what you\u2019re doing to break out of this Catch-22. Once you recognise your destructive behaviours it is much easier to change them.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 21:04:21", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9a71\u52a8,driven", "title": "\u7126\u8651\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53d1\u5c55", "title_en": "Anxiety Driven Development", "transed": 1, "url": "https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/anxiety-in-product-development/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9a71\u52a8", "driven"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f926704c140debcc17ecf3c823f4dbfa.jpg", "infoid": 1005139, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\n\n\n", "note_en": "The  coronavirus-related economic downturn may have set off a sudden plunge in global greenhouse gas emissions, but another crucial metric for determining the severity of global warming \u2014 the amount of greenhouse gases actually in the air \u2014 just hit a record high.\n  According to readings from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the amount of CO2 in the air in May 2020 hit an average of slightly greater than 417 parts per million (ppm). This is the highest monthly average value ever recorded, and is up from 414.7 ppm in May of last year.\n    Carbon dioxide levels are now the  highest they\u2019ve been in human history, and  likely the highest in 3 million years. The last time there was this much CO2 in the atmosphere, global average surface temperatures were  significantly warmer than they are today, and sea levels were 50 to 80 feet higher.\n  The continuing rise in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere may sound surprising in light of recent findings that the coronavirus pandemic, and the associated lockdowns, had led to a  steep drop in global greenhouse gas emissions, peaking at a 17 percent decline in early April.\n    But the total amount of CO2 that winds up in the atmosphere is driven not only by human emission levels, but also through processes on the land surface (especially forests) and in the oceans that fluctuate on a yearly basis.\n  According to a Scripps news release announcing the findings, CO2 emissions reductions on the order of 20 to 30 percent would need to be sustained for six to 12 months in order for the increase in atmospheric CO2 to slow in a detectable way.\n  \u201cThe buildup of CO2 is a bit like trash in a landfill. As we keep emitting, it keeps piling up,\u201d said Ralph Keeling, who directs  Scripps\u2019 carbon dioxide monitoring program, and whose late father, Charles David Keeling, began measurements at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii in 1958.\n  \u201cThe crisis has slowed emissions, but not enough to show up perceptibly at Mauna Loa. What will matter much more is the trajectory we take coming out of this situation,\u201d he said.\n    In the 1960s, the annual growth rate was about 0.8 ppm per year. It doubled in the 1980s, and eventually climbed to 2.4 ppm per year during the last decade. Multiple lines of evidence show the cause of this increase is greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, said Pieter Tans, who leads NOAA\u2019s Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases Group.\n    The Scripps researchers found that the average atmospheric CO2 concentration for May 2020 was 417.16 parts per million. Using different calculations than the Scripps team, NOAA researchers found the peak monthly value was slightly lower, at 417.1 ppm.\n  The annual high typically occurs in May before CO2 levels temporarily ebb as trees and plants in the Northern Hemisphere absorb vast quantities of the planet-warming gas during the summer growing season. Though CO2 levels exhibit a seasonal cycle, the overall upward trend is clear.\n  The rate of increase from last May to this May was slower than it was in the comparable to 2018 to 2019 period, but natural factors such as El Ni\u00f1o events in the tropical Pacific Ocean and changes in terrestrial carbon sinks, such as forests, can have a large influence on this from year to year, Tans said.\n    El Ni\u00f1o events can contribute to drought and extreme heat in large areas of the world, Tans says, noting they can weaken the ability of forests and other lands to soak up carbon dioxide, leading to a higher natural contribution to atmospheric CO2 levels.\n  The combination of record fossil fuel use and mild El Ni\u00f1o conditions between May 2018 and 2019 can explain the above average increase in atmospheric CO2 of 3.5 ppm that year.\n  Wildfires and deforestation can add to the increase in atmospheric CO2 as well, though their influence ultimately is overwhelmed by the global burning of fossil fuels.\n  According to Rob Jackson, an emissions expert with Stanford University and the Global Carbon Project, emissions from wildfires were up in 2019 and 2020, contributing to the May peak, as was Brazil\u2019s land emissions due to deforestation and  burning.\n    This year\u2019s May CO2 peak marked an increase of about 2.4 ppm compared to a year ago. The 2010 to 2019 average rate of increase is precisely the same at 2.4 ppm per year, according to NOAA. The decline of El Ni\u00f1o over the last year may help explain why the increase in the past year was not as large as the previous, Tans said.\n  Because atmospheric levels of CO2 are cumulative, they will continue to increase until net emissions are cut to zero. They will not decrease until human activities and natural ecosystems are removing more greenhouse gases than is going into the air.\n  Molecules of CO2, a global warming agent, can remain in the atmosphere for up to 1,000 years.\n  Scientists warn that we\u2019re on course to reach 450 ppm by mid-century, where levels would need to stop increasing to have a decent chance of meeting the goals in the Paris climate agreement, which seeks to limit climate change to well below 3.6 degrees (2 Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2100.\n  Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech, says the new findings underscore the need to act now. \u201cIt is a reminder that climate change is not on pause in any way, shape or form,\u201d she said.\n  Keeling says it would take a sustained drop in emissions, rather than a sudden decline related to the coronavirus pandemic, to show up more clearly in measurements of atmospheric CO2. \u201cWhat really matters here is setting a new trajectory,\u201d he said.\n  Jackson, who conducted the  analysis of emissions declines due to the pandemic with colleagues from the Global Carbon Project, said the new findings are not surprising given how the planet\u2019s carbon cycle works.\n  \u201cThis result is disappointing but expected in an atmosphere that is both big and variable,\u201d he said via email.\n  \u201cWe estimated that fossil carbon emissions dropped 8 percent [during] January through April, from 12 billion metric tons in 2019 to 11 billion in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cA billion tons is a lot, but not so much that we can find it with statistical confidence in a noisy signal.\u201d\n  It\u2019s important not to take the wrong message from the current finding, Jackson emphasized. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking that the effect of covid-19 on emissions is trivial or that climate progress is impossible. It isn\u2019t. Short-term changes in anything are hard to detect in something as big as the atmosphere.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-06-04 21:02:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u5386\u53f2,co2", "title": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e0e\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6392\u653e\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u5730\u7403\u7684\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u6c34\u5e73\u4ecd\u521b\u5386\u53f2\u65b0\u9ad8", "title_en": "Earth\u2019s CO2 levels hit record high, despite coronavirus-related emissions drop", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/06/04/carbon-dioxide-record-2020/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u5386\u53f2", "co2"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cab943ace0215078601f94b587988acc.png", "infoid": 1005138, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\n\n\n\n\n", "note_en": "Now, more than ever, citizens must be able to hold those in power accountable and inspire others through the act of protest.\n Protecting your electronic devices and digital  assets  before, during, and after a protest is vital to keeping yourself and your information safe, as well as getting your message out. Theft, damage, confiscation, or forced deletion of media can disrupt your ability to publish your experiences. At the same time, those engaging in protest may be subject to search or arrest, or have their movements and associations mapped. They could become targets of surveillance and repression.\n There are risks associated with attending a protest, and taking steps to mitigate them can go a long way in ensuring you\u2014and the  data  you value\u2014are kept safe. This guide outlines steps you can take before, during, and after a protest that will help maximize your effectiveness and keep yourself and your data more secure.\n Remember that these tips are general suggestions for better data security and do not constitute legal advice or counseling. If you have specific legal concerns, seek the advice of a licensed attorney.\n  \u00a0     Full-disk encryption ensures that the files across your entire device are encrypted. This is a form of encryption that protects  data  at rest\u2014not to be confused with \u201cin-transit encryption,\u201d which protects data that is transferred over the Internet. Full-disk encryption can help protect everything from your local database of text messages to the passwords stored in your browser. If your device is confiscated by police, or if it is lost or stolen, full-disk encryption can help protect the data stored on your device. Protest situations are often unpredictable, so losing your phone is a distinct possibility.\n Android and  iOS have long required full-disk encryption capabilities to be built into devices. These should be protected by a strong  password : 8-12 random characters that are easy to remember and type in when you unlock your device. If devices are not protected by a strong password, the encryption may be easier to break using a  brute-force attack.  The iPhone 5s and later have specialized hardware to protect against this type of  attack , but a complex, strong password is still the best practice.\n It is important to note that encrypting your device will likely not  encrypt  external storage media such as SD or flash memory cards. You have to encrypt these separately, and may not be able to encrypt them at all. You might want to investigate where files are stored on your device using a file browsing app, or remove external storage media from your device altogether.\n In addition, many digital cameras lack the ability to encrypt. It is safe to assume that photos and videos taken with digital cameras will be stored unencrypted, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n  Today, both iOS and Android allow users to unlock (and  decrypt ) their devices with their fingerprint, and the iPhone X\u2019s FaceID allows users to do the same with facial recognition. While these settings may seem appealing as convenient ways to enjoy the benefits of full-disk encryption, enabling them means an officer could physically force you to unlock your device with your fingerprint or face. In protest situations in particular\u2014or in any other situation in which you may be more likely to encounter a government demand to search your phone (such as at a border crossing)\u2014we suggest you  turn this functionality off.\n In the U.S., using a biometric\u2014like your face scan or fingerprint\u2014to unlock your phone may compromise protections for the contents of your phone afforded to you under the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled incrimination. A police officer may try to intimidate you into \u201cconsenting\u201d to unlock your phone, whether you use a biometric or a memorized passcode. But if you exercise your right to refuse and biometric unlocking functionality is turned on, an officer may physically force you to biometrically unlock your device. Under current U.S. law\u2014which is still in flux\u2014using a memorized passcode generally provides a stronger legal footing to push back in court against compelled device unlocking/decryption. While EFF continues to fight against attempts by law enforcement to compel people to decrypt their devices, there is currently less protection against compelled face and fingerprint unlocking than there is against compelled password disclosure.\n In iOS, you can disable this by going into Settings -&gt; Touch ID &amp; Passcode (or Settings -&gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode, depending on your iPhone version) and removing each of the fingerprints, or tapping Reset Face ID in this menu.\n In Android, disabling this feature may depend on your device manufacturer. For Pixel devices, go into Settings -&gt; Security -&gt; Pixel Imprint and delete the fingerprints from this menu.\n  Signal is an app available on both  iOS and  Android that offers strong encryption to protect both text messages and voice calls. This type of protection is called  end-to-end encryption , which secures your communications in transit.\n In addition to encrypting one-to-one communication, Signal enables encrypted group chats. The app also recently added the functionality of having messages disappear anywhere from 10 seconds to a week after they are first read. In contrast to some other services like SnapChat, these ephemeral messages will never be stored on any server, and are removed from your device after disappearing.\n In 2016, a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia  issued a subpoena to Open Whisper Systems, the developers of Signal. Because of the architecture of Signal, which limits the user  metadata  stored on the company\u2019s servers, the only data they were able to provide was &#34;the date and time a user registered with Signal and the last date of a user&#39;s connectivity to the Signal service.&#34;\n In the context of a protest, you might send relevant photos and videos to friends who are remote using Signal, so that if your phone is confiscated you have a way to retrieve the media later.\n  Take precautions to limit the potential costs of losing access to your device, whether it\u2019s lost, stolen or confiscated by law enforcement. Back up your data regularly and store that backup in a safe place to save yourself from a headache later on.\n  In the United States, federal regulation does not require you to show your ID to purchase a prepaid  SIM card  (but your state might). Most countries require you to provide a form of ID to purchase a prepaid SIM card, thus linking the card to your identity and removing the possibility of anonymity.\n If you&#39;re concerned about protecting the data stored on your device, don&#39;t bring it to the protest. Instead, purchase a  prepaid mobile phone. These devices can be purchased along with a SIM card at most large retail stores. Let your friends know your temporary number, and use this to coordinate activities. Remember that the location of mobile devices can be determined by the cell towers they connect to. So, if you don&#39;t want your identity and location known, turn off your prepaid device before going home or anywhere that might reveal your identity. Using GPS should be safe, since GPS is a receiver and does not transmit any information. However, keep in mind that your device may store your coordinates. For this reason, we suggest you  turn off  location services before you travel to the protest, and leave it off until you return. Turning off location services may make it difficult to navigate if you are not familiar with the route to and from the protest. You may want to download a local copy of the area map you will be traveling in.\n When you&#39;re done with the phone, it can be safely recycled or discarded from a location that is not linked to you. Keep in mind that if you carry both your regular device and a prepaid one with you, the location of these devices can be correlated and compromise your anonymity.\n  Many law enforcement agencies have access to sophisticated surveillance technology that can be used to identify people attending a protest. To protect yourself, it\u2019s important to dress in ways that preserve your anonymity and protect your physical safety.\n  Wearing the same clothing as everyone in your group can help hide your identity during the protest and keep you from being identified and tracked afterwards. This not only helps preserve your anonymity, but also protects your fellow protestors from being identified and surveilled as well. Dressing in dark, monochrome colors will help you blend into a crowd. Be aware that you may not be as visible to cars in the dark, and should take extra precaution when crossing streets or walking near moving vehicles.\n If you are able, bring a change of clothes for after the protest is over. You may be exposed to irritants such as pepper spray or tear gas during the protest, and it\u2019s wise to change into clothing that won\u2019t cause discomfort or harm on your return journey.\n  If you have visible tattoos or bright unconventional hair colors, cover them up. Tattoos can be used to identify you later, and may be added to databases for  tattoo recognition. Dark monochrome hats, scarves, gloves, long sleeves, and full-length clothing will help cover these identifying features so you blend more easily into a crowd.\n  Wear a mask! It will help protect you from airborne illnesses, face recognition technologies, and being identified in photos of the protest after it ends. Goggles are also useful for keeping your eyes safe from projectiles or irritants, and tinted ones may be useful for circumventing face recognition systems (but this strategy is not foolproof). Gloves will help protect your hands from irritants and contact with infectious diseases. If you are able to use medical gloves, use nitrile instead of latex gloves, as some people have latex allergies. Note that gloves will interfere with some phone functions. We also recommend wearing sturdy shoes that are comfortable to move around in for extended periods of time.\n  \u00a0     Catching that perfect image is something you want to be ready for, and powerful images can help support your cause. If you&#39;ve chosen a strong  password , entering it into the device takes precious time, and you  risk  the moment passing before you&#39;re able to take the picture. Luckily, iOS and Android allow you to take photos and videos without unlocking your device.\n At the iOS lock screen, you can firmly press on the camera icon. Older iOS devices require you to swipe.\n  If you are taking photos or videos of people at the protest, be mindful of what you post. If you post photos online where protestors or bystanders\u2019 faces are identifiable, law enforcement or vigilantes might track them down and arrest or harass them. Consider obscuring the faces of anyone who has their eyes or mouth visible. You can edit photos in the default Android or iOS photo editing apps. Be sure to black out or blur other identifying features as well such as tattoos or unique clothing (blurring can sometimes be reversed so blacking out is better if you have the option). On Android, consider using the  ObscuraCam app by The Guardian Project to edit photos, which will automatically blur faces. There is also a useful tool called  Image Scrubber that can be used on any mobile device, including iOS or your PC.\n  Once you are ready to post your photos, it\u2019s a  good idea to scrub the metadata contained in the image files if you don&#39;t want to leak personally identifying information. Metadata on photos can include information such as the model of camera the photo was taken on, the exact time and location where the photo was taken, and even your name.\n Option 1: Remove any original photo metadata by transferring the photo onto a desktop computer, taking a screenshot of the image, and posting the screenshot instead of the original photo.\n Option 2: You can also take a screenshot of the photo on your mobile device to remove the metadata, but the image quality may not be as high. You can then post that screenshot instead of the original photo.\n Option 3: Send yourself a copy of the photo via the Signal app (which strips metadata when sending images), then download the sent image for posting.\n   Automated License Plate Reader Systems (ALPRs) automatically record the license plates of cars driving through an area, along with the exact time, date, and location they were encountered. This technology is often used by law enforcement in the United States and many other countries, or employed by private companies such as  Vigilant and  MVTrac who then share license plate  data  with law enforcement and other entities. Amassed in huge databases, this data is retained for lengthy periods of time. These companies have lobbied and  litigated vigorously against statutes that would ban the private collection of license plate data or otherwise regulate ALPRs. Essentially, your location can be tracked over time based on the driving history of any car registered to you, with very few legal limits in place as to how this data can be collected, accessed, shared, and retained.\n   Be careful when traveling to and from the protest location. If you\u2019re using payment methods or transit cards that are linked to you, law enforcement may be able to determine you attended the protest and track your movements. Consider using alternative means of public transportation if you would prefer that your movements and associations remain private.\n If you are able, consider biking or walking to and from the protest to minimize exposure to these types of surveillance risks.\n  Airplane mode ensures that your device will not be transmitting for the duration of your time at the protest, and prevents your location from being tracked. Unfortunately, this also means that you won&#39;t be able to message or call your friends, so plan accordingly. Before going to the protest, agree on a spot where you and your friends can meet if you get separated. As mentioned earlier in this guide, you may also want to turn off location services before you travel to the protest, and leave it off until you return.\n Some apps allow you to navigate without having network access. Since GPS is a receive-only system, you can selectively turn GPS on after enabling airplane mode. Be sure to download a map of the area of the protest beforehand.\n  If you are detained and questioned by police, you have a right to remain silent, and to speak with an attorney before and during any questioning. It is best to say \u201cI want my attorney and I choose to remain silent\u201d and then refuse to answer questions until you have a chance to talk to a lawyer.\n If you answer questions, be sure to tell the truth. It is a crime to lie to a police officer and you may find yourself in more trouble for lying to law enforcement than for whatever it was they wanted to talk to you about in the first place.\n If the police ask to see your phone, you can tell them that you do  not consent to a search of your device. They might respond by seizing your phone and trying to search it later, but at least it will be clear that you did not give them permission to do so.\n If the police ask for the password to unlock your electronic device (or ask you to unlock it directly), you can refuse. You may suffer adverse consequences at the hands of law enforcement\u2014from having your phone seized to being booked into custody\u2014for refusing to provide your password or biometric  key . Every arrest situation is different, however, and you will need to consider your own  threat model .\n  \u00a0     If your device has been confiscated, you may have legal recourse to get it back. In the U.S., your attorney can file a motion for the return of your property if it is not being held as evidence in a pending case. If the police believe that evidence of a crime was found on your electronic device, including in your photos or videos, then the police can keep it as evidence. They may also attempt to end your ownership of your electronic device, but you can challenge such  asset  forfeiture in court.\n You can also revoke access for some services that are logged in on your device. For instance, on Twitter if you go to Settings and privacy -&gt; Apps and devices, you can revoke access for devices that have permission to connect to your Twitter account. For other services, simply changing your  password  or  passphrase  will prompt the app to log out. But beware that revoking law enforcement access may expose you to the  risk  of being charged with obstruction of justice or the destruction of evidence. You should always speak to your attorney first before deciding how to proceed. Online services may provide logs of recent log-ins for your account. If you are worried your device is being used to access accounts without your consent, it might be useful for you to see if such logs are available and monitor them. If law enforcement confiscates your device, they may use a \u201cforensic\u201d tool such as \u201cCellebrite\u201d to try to extract  data  from your device, such as images, contacts, messages, and location history. This is more likely to be successful if your phone is older or unencrypted. For this reason, it\u2019s important to carry the bare minimum of data with you, and use the strongest level of  encryption , when going into a risky situation like a protest.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 21:00:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6297\u8bae,attending", "title": "\u53c2\u52a0\u6297\u8bae\u6d3b\u52a8", "title_en": "Attending a Protest", "transed": 1, "url": "https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/attending-protest", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6297\u8bae", "attending"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4c65e4aac492e4a2fd3a5c0bfa935e6a.jpg", "infoid": 1005137, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\n\n\n\u636e\u83ab\u65af\u79d1\u7684\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u56e0\u6d89\u5acc\u4fb5\u72af\u4eba\u6743\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u7f8e\u56fd\u5236\u88c1\u7684\u8f66\u81e3\u9886\u5bfc\u4eba\u62c9\u59c6\u8d5e\u00b7\u5361\u5fb7\u7f57\u592b(Ramzan Kadyrov)\u5468\u4e8c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u6b63\u5728\u201c\u6050\u60e7\u5730\u5173\u6ce8\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5c40\u52bf\uff0c\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u5f53\u5c40\u6b63\u5728\u6076\u610f\u4fb5\u72af\u666e\u901a\u516c\u6c11\u7684\u6743\u5229\u201d\u3002", "note_en": "The scenes have been disturbingly familiar to CIA analysts accustomed to monitoring scenes of societal unraveling abroad \u2014 the massing of protesters, the ensuing crackdowns and the awkwardly staged displays of strength by a leader determined to project authority.\n In interviews and posts on social media in recent days, current and former U.S. intelligence officials have expressed dismay at the similarity between events at home and the signs of decline or democratic regression they were trained to detect in other nations.\n \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind of violence,\u201d said Gail Helt, a former CIA analyst responsible for tracking developments in China and Southeast Asia. \u201cThis is what autocrats do.

Referring to the despotic leaders of Iraq, Syria and Libya, he said: \u201cSaddam. Bashar. Qaddafi. They all did this.\u201d\n The impression Trump created was only reinforced by others in the administration. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper urged governors to \u201cdominate the battlespace\u201d surrounding protesters, as if describing U.S. cities as a foreign war zone. Later, as military helicopters hovered menacingly over protesters, Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, toured the streets of the nation\u2019s capital in his battle fatigue uniform.\n   \u201cAs a former CIA officer, I know this playbook,\u201d  Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) said in a tweet. Before her election to Congress last year, she worked at the agency on issues including terrorism and nuclear proliferation.\n  One U.S. intelligence official even ventured into downtown Washington on Monday evening, as if taking measure of the street-level mood in a foreign country.\n \u201cThings escalated quickly,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of his job. He emphasized that he went as a concerned citizen, not in any official capacity. After seeing tear gas canisters underfoot, he said, he \u201cknew it was time to go\u201d and departed.\n Former intelligence officials said the unrest and the administration\u2019s militaristic response are among many measures of decay they would flag if writing assessments about the United States for another country\u2019s intelligence service.\n   They cited the country\u2019s struggle to contain  the novel coronavirus, the president\u2019s attempt to pressure Ukraine for political favors, his attacks on the news media and the increasingly polarized political climate as other signs of dysfunction.\n Trump supporters have defended his handling of the unrest, and his trip across Lafayette Square as a display of the strength needed to restore order in dozens of cities where protests have led to looting, fires and violence.\n Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker (R) said it was \u201chard to imagine\u201d any other president \u201chaving the guts to walk out of the White House like this.\u201d\n But there were also indications that senior members of the administration were uncomfortable with the president\u2019s outing and eager to minimize their role in it.\n  A senior Pentagon official said Tuesday that neither Esper nor Milley knew when they set out to accompany Trump that police were about to charge through seemingly peaceful protesters or that they would play supporting roles in a photo op.\n  Even away from the cameras, Trump has assiduously cultivated the aura of a strongman. Earlier Monday, he had chided governors as \u201cweak\u201d for failing to employ adequate force in the face of mounting protests.\n \u201cIf you don\u2019t dominate, you\u2019re wasting your time,\u201d Trump said. He offered no words on how to ease tensions in crowds that have massed largely in anger over the death of George Floyd, an African American man who was killed while being pinned to the ground, a knee against his neck, by police in Minneapolis.\n  Brett McGurk, a former top U.S. envoy to the Middle East who spent two years in the Trump administration, said the president\u2019s words \u2014  recorded by participants and shared with news organizations \u2014 would only embolden the world\u2019s autocrats and undermine U.S. authority.\n \u201cThe imagery of a head of state in a call with other governing officials saying, \u2018Dominate the streets, dominate the battlespace\u2019 \u2014 these are iconic images that will define America for some time,\u201d said McGurk, who led U.S. diplomatic efforts to counter the Islamic State terrorist group. \u201cIt makes it much more difficult for us to distinguish ourselves from other countries we are trying to contest\u201d or influence, he said.\n  In recent years, U.S. officials have urged restraint or denounced crackdowns against protesters or vulnerable groups in Russia, Iran, Turkey, Malaysia, Syria and other countries.\n  Even this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lectured  China about its efforts to prevent citizens of Hong Kong from holding a vigil to mark the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests.\n \u201cIf there is any doubt about Beijing\u2019s intent, it is to deny Hong Kongers a voice and a choice,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement that was met with derision on Twitter because it coincided with crackdowns urged by Trump in the United States.\n The seeming hypocrisy in the U.S. position has not been lost on foreign targets of American pressure or criticism.\n Ramzan Kadyrov, a Chechen leader who has faced U.S. sanctions for alleged human rights abuses, said Tuesday that he was \u201cwatching with horror the situation in the United States, where the authorities are maliciously violating ordinary citizens\u2019 rights,\u201d according to  reports from Moscow.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 20:59:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "I should explain what the quote refers to. Microsoft employees are granted stock option grants when they start working there. Actually not all employees, just the programmers and other employees who are deemed worthy. The options vest - become available to be exercised - following a set schedule, so that after 4 1/2 years all of the initial options can be exercised. Since an option allows the employee to buy stock at the price when the option was granted, and the stock generally will have risen in that period of time, the employee can buy the stock cheap and sell it on the open market, pocketing some nice change. So FYIFV would imply that the employee had been there long enough for his or her initial grant to vest, could generate piles of cash in a hurry, and therefore had to answer to no one. For example, the quote above refers to the jubilation felt when Microsoft went public and people started cashing in stock. Well, I guess, although do you really believe that people would wear buttons that in effect said, &#34;I&#39;m richer than you?&#34; Of course, we are talking about Microsoft people, so I can understand why it sounded believable. There&#39;s another reason to doubt it, which is that employees (all employees, nowadays, even those who didn&#39;t get initial grants) are granted more options each year. These are usually less than the initial grant, but still this notion, that after 4 1/2 years the employee has gotten all the option money he or she is going to get, is simply false. Employees are never &#34;fully vested,&#34; because the new option grants are vesting over time also. &#34;Realize that the primary motivator for employees of dominant commercial OS vendors is money (note buttons worn by Microsoft employees that read &#39;FYIFV&#39;, you can search around on the Web yourself to figure out the acronym).&#34; - Chris McDonough, &#34; Countering The No-Support Argument for Linux and Other Open Source Software Offerings&#34; web page. A quote like this one is a little more ominous. Now it is being used to imply that Microsoft employees are money-grubbing individuals and that this attitude extends into their motivation to write software. Someone who wore an FYIFV button is obviously not motivated by any sense of altruism, and merely wants to separate people from their cash as quickly as possible, software quality be damned. &#34;For years, Softies were wont to sport buttons that read FYIFV: Fuck You, I&#39;m Fully Vested.&#34; - John Heileman, &#34; The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth&#34;,  Wired, November 2000. Now you are hitting a bit too close to home. This sentence is in an article about the Justice Department lawsuit about Microsoft (the same quote appears in Heileman&#39;s book,   Pride Before the Fall, based on the  Wired article). The FYIFV button is being used to show that Microsoft employees are basically mean people, capable of anything including illegal monopoly extension. The paragraph leading up to that reads, &#34;Extending a long middle finger to the government and your competitors is not conventional behavior among the top executives of most blue-chip companies. But, of course, Microsoft was different - self-consciously so. Populated by an army of young men (mainly), most of them unusually bright, many of them abnormally wealthy, working endless hours and pulling frequent all-nighters, Microsoft has always retained the air of a fraternity - a fraternity of rich eggheads, but a fraternity nonetheless.&#34; So let me use this article as an attempt to debunk this myth. I received one somewhat definitive email about the origin of the phrase: [Person X] is adamant that he NEVER made or wore an FYIFV button or T-Shirt. The story he tells is that he made a comment to the effect that some person was wearing their FYIFV T-Shirt that day, meaning that that person was being intransigent about something or other. The intended audience apparently understood that this was an entirely metaphorical reference, but someone else, not involved in the conversation, apparently overheard the crack and related it to Bill [Gates], misreporting the story by saying that [Person X] had actually made such a T-Shirt. [Person X] got called onto the carpet for this by Bill, who was skeptical that no such shirts actually existed and that [Person X] wasn&#39;t involved in their making. I had dinner with [Person X] that evening, and remember it well. I only ever saw one actual FYIFV shirt. The person made it themself and wore it only on their final day at MS. This was maybe &#39;92 or so, years after the original incident.\n OK, so someone heard the story themselves and made up ONE shirt as a joke. It was never meant to imply all the things it has been taken to imply. Now I am not claiming that Microsoft is populated by a bunch of saints. They are as obnoxious and egotistical as anyone else, and they certainly do stroll around the hallways in Redmond with some rude T-Shirts and buttons, bearing slogans aimed at various competitors.",

"note_en": "A game-changing technique for imaging molecules known as cryo-electron microscopy has produced its sharpest pictures yet \u2014 and, for the first time, discerned individual atoms in a protein.\n By achieving atomic resolution using cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), researchers will be able to understand, in unprecedented detail, the workings of proteins that cannot easily be examined by other imaging techniques, such as X-ray crystallography.\n The breakthrough, reported by two laboratories late last month, cements cryo-EM\u2019s position as the dominant tool for mapping the 3D shapes of proteins, say scientists. Ultimately, these structures will help researchers to understand how proteins work in health and disease, and lead to better drugs with fewer side effects.\n \u201cIt\u2019s really a milestone, that\u2019s for sure. There\u2019s really nothing to break anymore. This was the last resolution barrier,\u201d says Holger Stark, a biochemist and electron microscopist at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, who led one of the studies  1. The other  2 was led by Sjors Scheres and Radu Aricescu, structural biologists at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC-LMB) in Cambridge, UK. Both were posted on the bioRxiv preprint server on 22 May.\n \u201cTrue \u2018atomic resolution\u2019 is a real milestone,\u201d adds John Rubinstein, a structural biologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. Getting atomic-resolution structures of many proteins will still be a daunting task because of other challenges, such as a protein\u2019s flexibility. &#34;These preprints show where one can get to if those other limitations can be addressed,\u201d he adds.\n  Cryo-EM is a decades-old technique that determines the shape of flash-frozen samples by firing electrons at them and recording the resulting images. Advances in technology for detecting the ricocheting electrons and in image-analysis software catalysed a \u2018resolution revolution\u2019 that started around 2013. This led to protein structures that were sharper than ever before \u2014 and nearly as good as those obtained from X-ray crystallography, an older technique that infers structures from diffraction patterns made by protein crystals when they are bombarded with X-rays.\n Subsequent hardware and software advances led to more improvements in the resolution of cryo-EM structures. But scientists have had to largely rely on X-ray crystallography for obtaining atomic-resolution structures. However, researchers can spend months to years getting a protein to crystallize, and many medically important proteins won\u2019t form usable crystals; cryo-EM, by contrast, requires only that the protein be in a purified solution.\n Atomic-resolution maps are precise enough to unambiguously discern the position of individual atoms in a protein, at a resolution of around 1.2 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms (1.2 \u00d7 10 \u201310 m). These structures are especially useful for understanding how enzymes work and using those insights to identify drugs that can block their activity.\n To push cryo-EM to atomic resolution, the two teams worked on an iron-storing protein called apoferritin. Because of its rock-like stability, the protein has become a test bed for cryo-EM: a structure of the protein with a resolution of 1.54 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms was the previous record  3.\n  The teams then used technological improvements to take sharper pictures of apoferritin. Stark\u2019s team got a 1.25-\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m structure of the protein, with help from an instrument that ensures that the electrons travel at similar speeds before hitting a sample, enhancing the resolution of the resulting images. Scheres, Aricescu and their group used a different technology to fire electrons travelling at similar speeds; they also benefited from a technology that reduces the noise generated after some electrons career off the protein sample, as well as a more sensitive electron-detecting camera. Their 1.2-\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m structure was so complete, says Scheres, that they could pick out individual hydrogen atoms, both in the protein and in surrounding water molecules.\n Stark reckons that melding the technologies could push resolutions to around 1 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m \u2014 but not much further. \u201cBelow 1 \u00c5 is almost impossible to reach for cryo-EM,\u201d he says. Obtaining such a structure with existing state-of-the-art technology would take \u201cseveral hundred years of data recording and a non-realistic amount of compute power and data-storage capacities\u201d, his team estimates.\n  Scheres and Aricescu also tested their improvements on a simplified form of a protein called GABA A receptor. The protein sits in the membrane of neurons and is a target for general anaesthetics, anxiety medications and many other drugs. Last year, Aricescu\u2019s team used cryo-EM to map the protein to 2.5 \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms  4. But with the new kit, the researchers attained a 1.7-\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m resolution, with even better resolution in some key parts of the protein. \u201cIt was like peeling off a blur over your eyes,\u201d Aricescu says. \u201cAt this resolution, every half \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m opens up a whole universe.\u201d\n The structure revealed never-before-seen details in the protein \u2014 including the water molecules in the pocket where a chemical called histamine sits. \u201cThat is a gold mine for structure-based drug design,\u201d says Aricescu, because it shows how a drug could displace the water molecules, potentially resulting in medications with fewer side effects.\n An atomic-resolution map of GABA A, which isn\u2019t as stable as apoferritin, would be a challenge, says Scheres. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible, but it would be very impractical,\u201d because of the vast amount of data that would need to be collected. But other improvements, particularly in how protein samples are prepared, could pave the way for atomic-resolution structures of GABA A and other biomedically important proteins. Protein solutions are frozen on tiny grids made of gold, and alterations to these grids could hold proteins even stiller  5.\n \u201cEveryone is very excited and amazed by the truly astounding level of performance demonstrated by the MRC-LMB and Max Planck groups,\u201d says Radostin Danev, a cryo-EM specialist at the University of Tokyo. But he agrees that sample preparation is the field\u2019s major challenge for more wobbly proteins. \u201cSub-1.5-\u00c5, or even sub-2-\u00c5, resolution performance will remain accessible for some time to only well-behaved samples,\u201d he says.\n The breakthroughs are likely to cement cryo-EM\u2019s position as the go-to tool for most structural studies, says Scheres. Drug companies, which covet atomic-resolution structures, might be even more likely to turn to cryo-EM. But Stark thinks X-ray crystallography will retain some appeal. If a protein can be crystallized \u2014 and that\u2019s a big if \u2014 it\u2019s relatively efficient to generate structures of it bound to thousands of potential drugs in a short amount of time. But it can still take hours to days to generate enough data for extremely high-resolution cryo-EM structures.\n \u201cThere are still pros and cons for each of the techniques,\u201d says Stark. \u201cPeople have published lots of papers and reviews that say these latest advances in cryo-EM will be the death signal for X-ray. I doubt that.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-06-04 19:35:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9769\u547d\u6027,microscopy,\u86cb\u767d\u8d28", "title": "\u9769\u547d\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5fae\u6280\u672f\u9996\u6b21\u770b\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u539f\u5b50", "title_en": "Revolutionary microscopy technique sees individual atoms for first time", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01658-1", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9769\u547d\u6027", "\u86cb\u767d\u8d28"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "26b06c028a6943279b5aa7974dd970ef.jpg", "infoid": 1005134, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\n", "note_en": "Nearly 56% of the U.S. voting-age population cast ballots in the 2016\u00a0presidential election, representing a slight uptick compared with 2012 but less than in the record year of 2008. While most Americans \u2013 70% in a  recent Pew Research Center survey \u2013 say high turnout in presidential elections is very important, what constitutes \u201chigh turnout\u201d depends very much on which country you\u2019re looking at and which measuring stick you use.\n  The  Census Bureau\u00a0estimated that there were 245.5 million Americans ages 18 and older in November 2016, about 157.6 million of whom reported being registered to vote. (While political scientists typically define turnout as votes cast divided by the number of  eligible voters, in practice turnout calculations usually are based on the estimated voting-age population, or VAP.) Just over 137.5 million people told the census they voted in 2016, somewhat higher than the actual number of votes tallied \u2013 nearly 136.8 million, according to figures compiled by the  Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives, though that figure includes more than 170,000 blank, spoiled or otherwise null ballots. That sort of overstatement has long been noted by  researchers; the comparisons and charts in this analysis use the House Clerk\u2019s figure, along with data from\u00a0the\u00a0 International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance\u00a0(IDEA) and individual nations\u2019 statistical and elections authorities.\n The 55.7% VAP turnout in 2016 puts the U.S. behind most of its peers in\u00a0the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u00a0(OECD), most of whose members are highly developed, democratic states. Looking at the most recent nationwide election in each OECD nation, the U.S. placed 26th out of 32 (current VAP estimates weren\u2019t available for three countries).\n   The highest turnout rates among OECD nations were in Belgium (87.2%), Sweden (82.6%) and Denmark (80.3%). Switzerland consistently has the lowest turnout in the OECD: In 2015, less than 39% of the Swiss voting-age population cast ballots for the federal legislature.\n One factor behind Belgium\u2019s high turnout rates \u2013 between 83% and 95% of VAP in every election for the past four decades \u2013 may be that it is one of the 24 nations around the world (and six\u00a0in the OECD) with some form of compulsory voting, according to IDEA.\u00a0(One canton in Switzerland, also an OECD member nation, has compulsory voting.)\n While  compulsory-voting\u00a0laws aren\u2019t always strictly enforced, their presence or absence can have dramatic impacts on turnout. In Chile, for example, turnout plunged after the country moved from compulsory to voluntary voting in 2012 and began automatically enrolling eligible citizens. Even though essentially all voting-age citizens were registered for Chile\u2019s 2013 elections, turnout in the presidential race plunged to 42%, versus 87% in 2010 when the compulsory-voting law was still in place. (Turnout rebounded slightly in last year\u2019s presidential election, to 49% of registered voters.)\n Chile\u2019s situation points to yet another complicating factor when comparing turnout rates across countries: the distinction between who\u2019s eligible to vote and who\u2019s actually registered to do so. In many countries, the government takes the lead\u00a0in getting people\u2019s names\u00a0on the rolls \u2013 whether by registering them automatically once they become eligible\u00a0(as in, for example, Sweden or Germany) or by aggressively seeking out and registering eligible voters (as in the UK and Australia). As a result, turnout looks pretty similar regardless of whether you\u2019re looking at voting-age population or registered voters.\n  In the U.S., by contrast, registration is mainly an individual responsibility. And\u00a0registered voters represent a much smaller share of potential voters in the U.S. than just about any other OECD country. Only about 64% of the U.S. voting-age population (and 70% of voting-age  citizens) was\u00a0registered in 2016, according to the Census Bureau report, compared with 91% in Canada (2015) and the UK (2017), 96% in Sweden (2014), and 99% in Slovakia (2016).\n As a consequence, turnout comparisons\u00a0based only on registered voters may not be very meaningful. For instance, U.S. turnout in 2016 was 86.8% of registered voters, fourth-highest among OECD countries (and highest among those without compulsory voting). But\u00a0registered voters in the U.S. are much more of a self-selected group, already more likely to vote because they took the trouble to register themselves.\n There are even\u00a0more ways to calculate turnout. Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida who runs the United States Election Project,\u00a0 estimates turnout as a share of the \u201cvoting- eligible population\u201d by subtracting noncitizens and ineligible felons from the voting-age population and adding eligible overseas voters. Using those calculations, U.S. turnout improves somewhat, to  59.3% of the 2016 voting-eligible population. However, McDonald doesn\u2019t calculate comparable estimates for other countries.\n No matter how they\u2019re measured, U.S. turnout rates have been fairly consistent over the past several decades, despite some election-to-election variation. Since 1976, voting-age turnout has remained within an 8.5-percentage-point range \u2013 from just under 50% in 1996,\u00a0when\u00a0Bill Clinton was re-elected, to just over 58% in 2008, when Barack Obama won the White House. However, turnout  varies considerably\u00a0among different racial, ethnic and age groups.\n In several other OECD countries, turnout has drifted lower in recent decades. Greece, which has a compulsory-voting law on the books (though it\u2019s not enforced), saw turnout in parliamentary elections fall from 89% in 2000 to 62% in September 2015. In Norway\u2019s parliamentary elections last year, 70.6% of the voting-age population cast ballots \u2013 the lowest turnout rate in at least four decades. And in Slovenia, after a burst of enthusiasm following the country\u2019s independence from Yugoslavia in 1992 (when 85% of the voting-age population cast ballots),\u00a0turnout fell rapidly \u2013 sinking to\u00a054% in 2014,\u00a0a drop of 31 percentage points in just over two decades of democracy.\n On the other hand, turnout in recent elections has bumped up in several OECD countries. In Hungary\u2019s parliamentary elections this past April, nearly 72% of the voting-age population voted, up from 63.3% in 2014. In the Netherlands, turnout rose from 71% in 2012 to 77.3% in March 2017. And turnout inched above 69% in September 2017\u2019s German parliamentary election \u2013 the highest level since 2005.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 19:09:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "President  Vladimir Putin has declared a state of emergency in a region within the Arctic Circle in far northern Russia after 20,000 tons of oil leaked into a river from a power plant.\n The spillage occurred on May 29 when the &#34;oil products&#34; leaked from a tank in an industrial plant operated by a subsidiary of Norilsk Nickel, the world&#39;s largest producer of palladium and one of the largest producers of nickel,  \u00a0platinum and copper.\n  &#34;The\u00a0accident took place at\u00a0the\u00a0industrial site of\u00a0the\u00a0Nadezhdinski Metallurgical Plant, and\u00a0part of\u00a0the\u00a0spilled petrochemicals, a\u00a0considerable amount actually, seeped into the\u00a0Ambarnaya River,&#34; Putin said as he discussed the incident with officials on Wednesday,  according to the Kremlin. He questioned the measures being taken to\u00a0clean up the fuel leak that took place near the city of Norilsk in the Krasnoyarsk region, within the Arctic Circle.\n Discussing how news of the spill emerged in the televised meeting, Putin was reportedly shocked\u00a0to discover that local authorities had only learned of the incident from social media two days after it happened, and he admonished the region&#39;s governor Alexander Uss, Reuters reported.\n &#34;What are we to learn about emergency situations from social networks? Are you alright health wise over there?&#34; Putin said, the news agency reported Wednesday.

At Signal, we support the people who have gone into the streets to make their voices heard. We believe that something in America needs to change, and even if we don\u2019t know exactly how, we support and trust in the people who are self-organizing around the country to figure it out. Many of the people and groups who are organizing for that change are using Signal to communicate, and we\u2019re working hard to keep up with the increased traffic. We\u2019ve also been working to figure out additional ways we can support everyone in the street right now. One immediate thing seems clear: 2020 is a pretty good year to cover your face. The latest version of Signal for Android and iOS introduces a new blur feature in the image editor that can help protect the privacy of the people in the photos you share. Now it\u2019s easy to give every face a hiding place, or draw a fuzzy trace over something you want to erase. Simply tap on the new blur tool icon to get started. This update has already been submitted to the app stores, and it will begin rolling out as soon as possible.  The new blur feature leverages the latest system and platform-level libraries for Android and iOS. In order to maintain your privacy, all of the processing happens locally on your own device. These system libraries are not perfect. They don\u2019t detect every face 100% of the time, and these flaws and potential biases meant that it was important to extend their default functionality so that you can always draw with the blur brush to manually obscure additional faces or areas in a photo.  We want to do something outside of the app too, so we\u2019ll be distributing versatile face coverings to the community free of charge. We\u2019ve been working to find a manufacturer capable of producing high volumes of face coverings in the current global circumstances. We\u2019re finalizing a few remaining details and will provide more information soon.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 18:44:36", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

"note_en": "Between 8,000 and 10,000\u00a0 e-scooters are being destroyed in the Middle East by California scooter sharing start-up Bird, according to sources.\n Bird is scrapping thousands of e-scooters in the Middle East and shutting down its operations in the majority of the region as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to five people familiar with the matter.\n The e-scooters being scrapped belong to Circ, which was acquired by Bird for an undisclosed sum in January.\n  There are between 8,000 and 10,000 Circ scooters across cities in Qatar, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates, according to one former employee and one company source who asked to be kept anonymous as they&#39;ve signed a confidentiality agreement.\n Bird is paying around $300,000 to have all of Circ&#39;s scooters in the Middle East scrapped, the former employee told CNBC.\n Bird said it has &#34;temporarily paused operations&#34; in the Middle East because of the hot weather, adding that it is using the break to &#34;recycle&#34; some vehicles. Bird will continue to operate its own scooters in Tel Aviv.\n &#34;During this pause, we are taking the opportunity to responsibly recycle parts of the old Circ fleet that were previously used in the region,&#34; a Bird spokesperson said.\n &#34;Following extreme wear and tear, the Circ vehicles no longer met our rigorous quality standards. Selling or re-use of these vehicles would potentially result in safety and reliability issues, which would not have been fair or ethical to the purchasers or potential riders. We look forward to resuming our service throughout more parts of the region later this year.&#34;\n  On March 27, Bird  laid off around 30% of its workforce on a Zoom call, or 406 people out of 1,387 employees prior to the layoffs.\n The entire Circ team in the Middle East, which comprised of around 75 people, was laid off that day and many of them had their last day on May 31, according to the former employee and two other industry sources who preferred to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n &#34;They&#39;re completely shutting down the operation,&#34; said the former employee. &#34;They&#39;ve pulled out and closed the Middle East. Everyone is unemployed.&#34;\n &#34;They (Bird) hung around after acquiring Circ and said they were backing us because we had 70% market share out here and we were in a very good position. Obviously Covid came in and they decided they didn&#39;t want to do it anymore. We were expecting pay cuts because it was a bad time with obviously no operation but then they turned around and made everyone redundant.&#34;\n  Governments are throwing their weight behind e-scooters and e-bikes as a viable alternative to cars and public transport in the age of the coronavirus.\n E-scooter sharing companies have marketed themselves as sustainable, environmentally-friendly businesses that cut carbon emissions.\u00a0But there have been questions about the longevity of their vehicles, with reports suggesting some Bird e-scooters have a life span of just a few months.\n Last week, it emerged that\u00a0 Uber is scrapping thousands of e-bikes and e-scooters worth millions of dollars after selling its Jump unit to mobility start-up Lime.\n  The firm said it decided to &#34;recycle&#34; the older models that Lime didn&#39;t want after concluding that it would be too complicated to give them away due to the maintenance and technical support that they need.\n Lawrence\u00a0Leuschner, the co-founder and CEO of Berlin scooter company Tier, told CNBC that he has offered to take the scooters from Uber Jump and Bird but neither of the companies took him up on the offer.\n Frank Meehan, co-founder of environmental start-up Equilibrium, wrote on Twitter: &#34;Some bike and scooter sharing companies have to be some of the worst environmental polluters of the last decade, and have been really irresponsible.&#34;\n Correction: A quote in this story has been updated to show that Circ had a 70% share of the market in the Middle East.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 18:21:10", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "app,\u4e2d\u4e1c,scrapping", "title":

"note_en": "Recently, I had some issues with my email provider and it gave me a bit of a scare as I realized that I had taken email for granted and did not have a backup in case things went south. Since my email address is run off of a domain that I own, I can easily switch email providers. However, I use mutt and it does not download all the email bodies in all the folders so I did not necessarily have a local copy of all my emails.\n  Thus began the hunt for a simple email backup solution and I found it in the form of a really nice python script:  imapgrab.py. Note that this script has the following requirements:\n  Once the requiremements are met, simply copy the script over to any folder and execute it as follows:  ./imapgrab.py -l -s imap.mail.server -u username -p password. This will list all available IMAP folders on the provided server. To download a copy of all mails run the following:\n ./imapgrab.py -d -v -f ~/user@email.com -s imap.mail.server -S -p 993 -u user@email.com -p password -m &#34;_ALL_,-INBOX.Trash,-INBOX.Spam,-INBOX.Junk,-Trash,-Junk,-Spam&#34;\n -d instructs the script to download the IMAP folders.  -f provides the location to store the downloaded email.  -m provides instructions as to what to download (here we download everything except the trash and spam folders). Check out the script itself for more usage parameters.\n With this script running, I was able to regularly backup my email and as a bonus, here are the commands to encrypt and decrypt the backed up emails (linux specific):\n # create archivetar -jcvf ~/user@email.com.tar.bz2 ~/user@email.com # encrypt (could take a while)gpg -c ~/user@email.com.tar.bz2# delete originalrm ~/user@email.com.tar.bz2rm -rf ~/user@email.com# decryptgpg ~/user@email.com.tar.bz2.gpg# extracttar -xvf ~/user@email.com.tar.bz2\n   Finally, in order to actually read the emails, you can import the mailboxes in thunderbird or use mutt as I like to do:  mutt -f ~/user@email.com/INBOX.mbox :).\n Note that at the time of writing the script does not work with Python 3 and if you do manage to convert it, please do throw me a shout!", "posttime": "2020-06-04 17:31:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6,email", "title":

timer integrated circuit,said to be the world&#39;s best-selling integrated circuitwith billions sold.Designed by analog IC wizard Hans Camenzind [2] in 1970, the 555 has been called one of the greatest chips of all time withwhole books devoted to 555 timer circuits. Given the popularity of the 555 timer, I thought it would be interesting to find out what&#39;s inside the 555 timer and how it works.While the 555 timer is usually sold as a black plastic IC, it is also available in a metal can, which can be cut open with a hacksaw [3]revealing the tiny die inside. Inside the 555 timer. The tiny die in the package is connected to the 8 pins by wires.\n The 555 timer has hundreds of applications, operating as anything from a timer or latch to a voltage-controlled oscillator or modulator.The diagram below illustrates how the 555 timer operates as a simple oscillator.Inside the 555 chip, three resistors form a divider generating references voltages of 1/3 and 2/3 of the supply voltage.The external capacitor will charge and discharge between these limits, producing an oscillation.In more detail, the capacitor will slowly charge (A) through the external resistors until its voltage hits the 2/3 reference.At that point (B), the upper (threshold) comparator switches the flip flop off and the output off. This turns on the discharge transistor, slowly discharging the capacitor (C). When the voltage on the capacitor hits the 1/3 reference (D), the lower (trigger) comparator turns on, setting the flip flop and the output, and the cycle repeats. The values of the resistors and capacitor control the timing, from microseconds to hours. [4] To summarize, the key components of the 555 timer are the comparators to detect the upper and lower voltage limits, the three-resistor divider to set these limits, and the flip flop to keep track of whether the circuit is charging or discharging.The 555 timer has two other pins (reset and control voltage) that I haven&#39;t covered above; they can be used for more complex circuits. The photo below shows the silicon die of the 555 through a microscope.On top of the silicon, a thin layer of metal connects different parts of the chip. This metal is clearly visible in the photo as yellowish-white traces and regions. Under the metal, a thin, glassy silicon dioxide layer provides insulation between the metal and the silicon, except where contact holes in the silicon dioxide allow the metal to connect to the silicon. At the edge of the chip, thin wires connect the metal pads to the chip&#39;s external pins. The different types of silicon on the chip are harder to see.Regions of the chip are treated ( doped) with impurities to change the electrical properties of the silicon. N-type silicon has an excess of electrons (negative), while P-type silicon lacks electrons (positive).In the photo, these regions show up as a slightly different color surrounded by a thin black border.These regions are the building blocks of the chip, forming transistors and resistors. Transistors are the key components in a chip. The 555 timer uses NPN and PNP bipolar transistors.If you&#39;ve studied electronics, you&#39;ve probably seen a diagram of an NPN transistor like the one below, showing the collector (C), base (B), and emitter (E) of the transistor, The transistor is illustrated as a sandwich of P silicon in between two symmetric layers of N silicon; the N-P-N layers make an NPN transistor.It turns out that transistors on a chip look nothing like this, and the base often isn&#39;t even in the middle! Schematic symbol for an NPN transistor, along with an oversimplified diagram of its internal structure.\n The photo below shows one of the transistors in the 555 as it appears on the chip.The slightly different tints in the silicon indicate regions that has been doped to form N and P regions.The whitish-yellow areas are the metal layer of the chip on top of the silicon - these form the wires connecting to the collector, emitter, and base. You can spot an emitter on the chip by its &#34;bullseye&#34; structure, while the base rectangle surrounds the emitter. An NPN transistor in the 555 timer chip. The collector (C), emitter (E) and base (B) are labeled, along with N and P doped silicon.\n Underneath the photo is a cross-section drawing illustrating how the transistor is constructed. There&#39;s a lot more than just the N-P-N sandwich you see in books, but if you look carefully at the vertical cross section below the &#39;E&#39;, you can find the N-P-N that forms the transistor. The emitter (E) wire is connected to N+ silicon. Below that is a P layer connected to the base contact (B). And below that is an N+ layer connected (indirectly) to the collector (C). [5]The transistor is surrounded by a P+ ring that isolates it from neighboring components. You might expect PNP transistors to be similar to NPN transistors, just swapping the roles of N and P silicon. But for a variety of reasons, PNP transistors have an entirely different construction.They consist of a small circular emitter (P), surrounded by a ring shaped base (N), which is surrounded by the collector (P). This forms a P-N-P sandwich horizontally (laterally), unlike the vertical structure of the NPN transistors. The diagram below shows one of the PNP transistors in the 555, along with a cross-section showing the silicon structure.Note that although the metal contact for the base is on the edge of the transistor, it is electrically connected through the N and N+ regions to its active ring in between the collector and emitter.A metal line is routed between the collector and base, but is not part of the transistor. A PNP transistor in the 555 timer chip. Connections for the collector (C), emitter (E) and base (B) are labeled, along with N and P doped silicon. The base forms a ring around the emitter, and the collector forms a ring around the base.\n The output transistors in the 555 are much larger than the other transistors and have a different structure in order to produce the high-current output. The photo below shows one of the output transistors. Note the multiple interlocking &#34;fingers&#34; of the emitter and base, surrounded by the large collector. A large, high-current NPN output transistor in the 555 timer chip. The collector (C), base (B) and emitter (E) are labeled.\n Resistors are a key component of analog chips. Unfortunately, resistors in ICs are large and inaccurate; the resistances can vary by 50% from chip to chip. Thus, analog ICs are designed so only the ratio of resistors matters, not the absolute values, since the ratios remain nearly constant. A resistor inside the 555 timer. The resistor is a strip of P silicon between two metal contacts.\n The photo above shows a 1K&amp;ohm resistor in the 555, formed from a strip of P silicon (visible as an outline). Note that the resistor connects two metal wires and another metal wire crosses it.The resistor below is an L-shaped 100K&amp;ohm  pinch resistor.A layer of N silicon on top of the pinch resistor makes the conductive region much thinner (i.e. pinches it), forming a much higher but less accurate resistance. A pinch resistor inside the 555 timer. The resistor is a strip of P silicon between two metal contacts. An N layer on top pinches the resistor and increases the resistance.\n There are some subcircuits that are very common in analog ICs, but may seem mysterious at first. The current mirror is one of these.If you&#39;ve looked at analog IC block diagrams, you may have seen the symbols below, indicating a current source, and wondered what a current source is and why you&#39;d use one. The idea is you start with one known current and then you can &#34;clone&#34; multiple copies of the current with a simple transistor circuit, the current mirror. The following circuit shows how a current mirror is implemented with two identical transistors. [6] A reference current passes through the transistor on the left. (In this case, the current is set by the resistor.) Since both transistors have the same emitter voltage and base voltage, they source the same current, so the current on the right matches the reference current on the left. A common use of a current mirror is to replace resistors. As explained earlier, resistors inside ICs are both inconveniently large and inaccurate. It saves space to use a current mirror instead of a resistor whenever possible. Also, the currents produced by a current mirror are nearly identical, unlike the currents produced by two resistors. Three transistors form a current mirror in the 555 timer chip. They all share the same base and two transistors share emitters.\nThe three transistors above form a current mirror with two outputs. Note the three transistors share the base connection, tied to the collector on the right, and the emitters on the right are tied together. The transistor on the left is a  Widlar current source, a modified mirror that produces a smaller current. On the schematic, the two transistors on the right are drawn as a single two-collector transistor, Q19. The second important circuit to understand is the differential pair, the most common two-transistor subcircuit used in analog ICs. [7]You may have wondered how a comparator compares two voltages, or an op amp subtracts two voltages. This is the job of the differential pair. Schematic of a simple differential pair circuit. The current sink sends a fixed current I through the differential pair. If the two inputs are equal, the current is split equally between the two branches. Otherwise, the branch with the higher input voltage gets most of the current.\n The schematic above shows a simple differential pair. The current sink at the bottom provides a fixed current I, which is split between the two input transistors. If the input voltages are equal, the current will be split equally into the two branches (I1 and I2). If one of the input voltages is a bit higher than the other, the corresponding transistor will conduct more current, so one branch gets more current and the other branch gets less.A small input difference is enough to direct most of the current into the &#34;winning&#34; branch, flipping the comparator on or off. In the 555, the threshold comparator uses NPN transistors, while the trigger comparator uses PNP transistors. This allows the threshold comparator to work near the supply voltage and the trigger comparator to work near ground. The 555&#39;s comparators also use two transistors on each input ( Darlington pair) to buffer the inputs. The 555 die photo and schematic [8]below are interactive. Click on a component in the die or schematic, and a brief explanation of the component will be displayed.(For a thorough discussion of how the 555 timer works, see 555 Principles of Operation.) For a quick overview, the large output transistors and discharge transistor are the most obvious features on the die. The threshold comparator consists of Q1 through Q8. The trigger comparator consists of Q10 through Q13, along with current mirror Q9.Q16 and Q17 form the flip flop. The three 5K&amp;ohm resistors forming the voltage divider are in the middle of the chip. [9]Urban legend says that the 555 is named after these three 5K resistors, but according to its designer555 is just an arbitrary number in the 500 chip series Integrated circuit usually come in a black epoxy package which require inconveniently dangerous  concentrated acid to open.Instead, I bought a 555 in a metal can (below).To examine the die, I used a  metallurgical microscope. Unlike a standard microscope, the metallurgical microscope shines light down through the lens allowing it to work with opaque objects (such as chips).I stitched the photos together with Hugin ( details). Given the popularity of the 555, it&#39;s surprising that it has several rookie design flaws; unbalanced comparators, large operating currents, an asymmetric output waveform, and temperature sensitivity. [10] In 1997, Camenzind redesigned the 555 to create a much better chip that could run at much lower voltages.The improved chip was sold by Zetex as the ZSCT1555, but unfortunately was a flop.The continuing success of the original 555 and the failure of the improved successor can be viewed as an example of the  worse is better principle. I hope you&#39;ve found this look inside the 555 timer chip interesting.Next time you&#39;re building a  555 project, you&#39;ll know exactly what&#39;s inside the chip.If you enjoyed this article, I&#39;ve also reverse-engineered the 741 op amp and 7805 voltage regulator.Thanks to Eric Schlaepfer [11] for helpful comments. Follow me on Twitter and you won&#39;t miss an article!  [1]The 555 timer is iconic enough to appear on mugs,  bags, caps and t-shirts. [2]The book  Designing Analog Chips written by the 555&#39;s inventor Hans Camenzind is really interesting, and I recommend it if you want to know how analog chips work.Chapter 11 has an extensive discussion of the 555&#39;s history and operation. Page 11-3 claims the 555 has been the best-selling IC every year, although I don&#39;t know if that is still true.The free PDF is  hereor get the book. [3]You can cut an IC can open with a plain hacksaw, but a jeweler&#39;s saw gives a much cleaner cut. I got a jeweler&#39;s saw on eBay for $14, and used the #2 blade. Make sure you cut near the top of the IC so you don&#39;t hit the die as I did. [4]The brilliant part of the 555 timer is that the oscillation frequency depends only on the external resistors and capacitor and is insensitive to the supply voltage. If the supply voltage drops, the 1/3 and 2/3 references drop too, so you might expect the oscillations to be faster. But the lower voltage charges the capacitor more slowly, canceling this out and keeping the frequency constant. This voltage insensitivity is so tricky that the chip&#39;s designer didn&#39;t figure it out until near the end of the 555&#39;s design,but it made a big difference.The original design was more complex and required nine pins, which is a terrible size for an ICsince there are no packages between 8 and 14 pins.The final, simpler 555 design worked with 8 pins, making the chip&#39;s packaging much cheaper.(See page 11-3 of  Designing Analog Chips for the full story.) [5]You might have wondered why there is a distinction between the collector and emitter of a transistor, when the typical diagram of a transistor is symmetrical.As you can see from the die photo, the collector and emitter are very different in a real transistor. In addition to the very large size difference, the silicon doping is different. The result is a transistor will have  poor gain if the collector and emitter are swapped. [6]For more information about current mirrors, check  wikipedia, any analog IC book, or chapter 3 of Designing Analog Chips. [7]Differential pairs are also called long-tailed pairs.According to Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuitsdifferential pairs are &#34;perhaps the most widely used two-transistor subcircuits in monolithicanalog circuits.&#34; (p214)For more information about differential pairs, see  wikipedia, any analog IC book, or chapter 4 of Designing Analog Chips. [8]The 555 schematic used in this article is from the  Philips datasheet. [9]Note that the three resistors for the voltage divider are parallel and next to each other.This helps ensure they have the same resistance even if there are electrical variations across the silicon. [10]I&#39;m not criticizing the 555; Hans Camenzind points out the design flaws and attributes them to &#34;the early periodof IC design (and the inexperience of a rookie designer)&#34;;see Designing Analog Chips, page 11-4.The design of a 555 replacement is discussed in detail in &#34;Redesigning the old 555&#34;, IEEE Spectrum, September 1997.That article makes it clear how much much faster IC design is now than in 1970.It took months to create the layout of the 555 chip by hand and manually verify it for correctness.The new chip took two days to layout and 20 minutes to verify. [11]Evil Mad Scientist sells a very cool  discrete 555 timer kit, duplicating the 555 circuit on a larger scale with individual transistors and resistors \u2014 it actually works as a 555 replacement.Their  555 footstool is also worth a look.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 17:30:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Ancient artists used several techniques to paint images on rock. Sometimes they drew by hand, but other times they would place an object like a hand, a leaf, or a boomerang against the wall and spatter it with paint, leaving behind a spray of color surrounding a silhouette of the object. This may sound like a simple way to produce art, but there&#39;s new evidence that it could be a fairly complex process. People in northern Australia seem to have used beeswax to shape miniature stencils to paint on the walls of Yilbilinji Rock Shelter in Limmen National Park.\n  The miniature images are part of a veritable gallery of rock art on the roof and rear walls of Yilbilinji. Over thousands of years, people came here to paint people, animals, objects, tracks, dots, and geometric motifs in striking red, yellow, black, and white. There\u2019s even a European smoking pipe in the mix, which shows that at least some of the paintings must have been created after the colonists arrived.\n Out of 355 images painted on the walls, only 59 are stencils\u2014outlines of full-sized hands and forearms surrounded by sprays of white pigment (probably made with local kaolin clay). But 17 of those stencils are too small to have been done the usual way, by spattering an actual object with paint to leave a life-sized outline on the wall. They depict people\u2014sometimes holding boomerangs and shields or wearing headdresses\u2014crabs, echidna, at least two species of turtle, kangaroo pawprints, and geometric shapes.\n And those miniature stenciled paintings are some of the only ones of their kind in the world, except for a tiny human figure stenciled on a cave wall in Indonesia and one in a rock shelter in New South Wales, Australia.\n Of course, most of the drawings and paintings left behind by ancient people are smaller than life-size, but it\u2019s much easier to draw a scaled-down version of an aurochs or a person than it is to  stencil one. Unless you take the time to make yourself a model or template first, that is. And that seems to be exactly what the artists at Yilbilinji\u2014which is traditionally the domain of the Marra people\u2014did.\n     Archaeologists and anthropologists, working with Marra rangers, noticed that most of the miniature stencils had rounded edges, and it looked like they had been sprayed over something that fit flush against the contours of the rock. That suggested the templates may have been something soft and easily molded, like clay, resin, or beeswax. And beeswax looks like the most likely option.\n Today, the Marra and other people in northern Australia still use beeswax as an adhesive to repair spears, harpoons, and other tools; most men carry a ball of beeswax as part of their personal kit, just in case. But children also carry beeswax, which they mold into animals, people, and other objects\u2014think of it as organic play-dough. Flinders University archaeologist Liam Brady and his colleagues wanted to find out if beeswax shapes could also be used to create stencils on rock, so they decided to play with some beeswax themselves.\n When it was warm and soft, it only took a couple of minutes to mold the beeswax into a variety of shapes that looked like the stencils at Yilbilinji. Brady and his colleagues stuck their beeswax templates onto a slab of sandstone, then spattered it with paint from white kaolin clay and water. The results looked a lot like the Yilbilinji paintings.\n That suggests beeswax could work\u2014but is that really how the Yilbilinji artists made their miniature stencils? Brady and his colleagues didn\u2019t get to date the paintings or test the rock shelter\u2019s walls for microscopic traces of beeswax, resin, or some other soft, sticky material, but they hope to come back with the right equipment on a later trip.\n  The stencils\u2019 meaning is harder to figure out than how they were made. \u201cNo information about the potential meaning or significance was obtained from our Marra collaborators,\u201d wrote Brady and his colleagues.\n For the Marra, Yilbilinji Rock Shelter is a site associated with Karrimala, one of the Ancestral Beings who travelled through Australia during the Dreamtime to create the continent\u2019s landforms, plants, animals, and people. Karrimala created the rock shelter and placed himself on the wall in the form of a painted snake. People lived at Yilbilinji in the past; the floor of the rock shelter is still littered with stone tools, grinding stones, and a stone-ringed fireplace.\n At another rock shelter in Limmen National Park, Brady and his colleagues found small beeswax figures still stuck to the walls. The Marra men working with the archaeologists told them those figures were involved in a certain ritual, one they were nervous even talking about. Men whose families had the right connections to certain places, and who knew the right songs to sing, could use images on those places\u2019 walls to magically attack their enemies, the Marra men told Brady and his colleagues.\n But they also told the archaeologists that Yilbilinji Rock Shelter isn\u2019t a site associated with that sort of thing.\n \u201cWhat is important here is that this discovery adds another dimension to the Australian and global rock art record,\u201d said Flinders University archaeologist Amanda Kearney, a co-author of the study.", "posttime": "2020-06-04 16:39:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u827a\u672f,\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a,miniature,\u8702\u8721", "title": "\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u53d1\u73b0\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u5fae\u578b\u5ca9\u77f3\u827a\u672f", "title_en": "Rare miniature rock art found in Australia", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/rare-miniature-rock-art-found-in-australia/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u827a\u672f", "\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a", "miniature", "\u8702\u8721"]}]
