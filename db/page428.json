This will allow developers to explore and build unique experiences to help your shows reach new listeners in new ways. If you want to dive into the technical nitty gritty, then jump on over to our  Spotify for Developers blog to learn more about how you can start exploring. And if you want to learn more about what this means for you and your show, we\u2019re here to walk you through it.\n Simply put, an API allows developers to build their own products that integrate with a larger platform (like Spotify). Our API, just like any other API, simply provides access, but does not prescribe how it&#39;s used; the only limit to how an API is used is a developer\u2019s creativity. In this case, it means third-party developers will be able to build really powerful new experiences for listeners leveraging Spotify&#39;s podcast ecosystem.\n Here at Spotify, we\u2019ve had our own music-related APIs set up for over a decade and in that time we\u2019ve seen developers create awesome experiences for their users. For example, the popular playlist app Dubolt helps users discover new tracks and artists that sound like old favorites. And over at Popularity Contest, a web app that\u2019s powered in part by Spotify\u2019s Web API, users are presented with two artists at random and have to guess which one is more popular on the platform.\n The new podcast API will function in similar ways to our music-related APIs by empowering developers to build unique experiences for listeners that leverages all of the public (and in this case podcast-related) data on Spotify. That means access to show and episode titles, description, and art. It will also allow developers to programmatically search Spotify\u2019s catalog of over 700,000 podcasts and fetch information about shows and episodes.\n Plus, if listeners grant apps the access, those that are developed using the podcast API could create ways to follow or unfollow podcasts on behalf of a user, see any currently playing podcasts, list the shows that a user has followed, and see how much of a given podcast episode has already been streamed.\n We can\u2019t wait to see what developers will come up with using this API and watch how these new ideas and projects might serve our podcast creators and increase discoverability. And any innovation \u2014 whether it be an app that helps you share what you\u2019re listening to with friends or a calendar integration that sets an alert for when your favorite show is expected to release a new episode\u2014will ultimately provide listeners with more ways to experience your podcast.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:44", "tags": "\u64ad\u5ba2,spotify,introduces,api", "title": "Spotify\u63a8\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u64ad\u5ba2API", "title_en": "Spotify Introduces a New Podcast API", "transed": 0, "url": "https://podcasters.spotify.com/blog/spotify-introduces-new-podcast-api", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u64ad\u5ba2", "spotify", "api"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b63445106b3eb7a38d5d84d1d3ed0c6b.jpg", "infoid": 1000143, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6811\u8393\u6d3e\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7167\u76f8\u677f\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u6781\u5927\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e7f\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684DIY\u7535\u8111\u7231\u597d\u8005\u548c\u7231\u597d\u8005\u7684\u6444\u5f71\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u6b3e\u76f8\u673a\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u76f8\u673a\u201d\uff0c\u75311230\u4e07\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u80cc\u9762\u7167\u660e\u578b\u7d22\u5c3cIMX477\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c1.55\u5fae\u7c73\u50cf\u7d20\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\n\u4e4b\u524d\u4e5f\u6709\u5b98\u65b9\u7684Raspberry Pi\u76f8\u673a\u4e3b\u677f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8981\u5c0f\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7126\u8ddd\u955c\u5934\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u76f8\u673a\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u7684C-\u548cCS-\u652f\u67b6\u955c\u5934\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u540e\u7f6e\u7126\u8ddd\u3002\u9996\u6279\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u51c6\u7684\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u5305\u62ec\u552e\u4ef725\u7f8e\u5143\u76846 mm CS\u5b89\u88c5\u578b\u955c\u5934\u548c50\u7f8e\u5143\u768416 mm C\u5b89\u88c5\u578b\u955c\u5934\u3002\n\u4e3b\u677f\u5177\u6709CS\u5b89\u88c5\uff0c\u4f46\u9644\u5e26C\u5b89\u88c5\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u4ea7\u54c1\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u5730\u5b89\u88c5\u5404\u79cd\u5404\u6837\u7684\u955c\u7247\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4f73\u80fd(Canon)70-200 mm f/2.8\u7684\u7535\u8def\u677f\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u4e3b\u610f\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\u90fd\u5f88\u68d2\uff1a\n\u6811\u8393PI\u7684\u62e5\u6709\u8005\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u4ece\u5bb6\u5ead\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u5230DIY\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u9879\u76ee\u3002\u6811\u8393PI\u51fa\u7248\u793e\u6b63\u5728\u51fa\u7248\u4e00\u672c\u65b0\u7684PI\u76f8\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u53d1\u552e10 GB(12.50\u7f8e\u5143)\u7684\u5370\u5237\u7248\u6216PDF\u514d\u8d39\u7248\u3002\n\u8fd9\u6b3e\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u76f8\u673a\u517c\u5bb9\u4ece1Model B\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6240\u6709Raspberry Pi\u7535\u8111\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u7684800\u4e07\u50cf\u7d20\u76f8\u673a\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\u3001\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u9009\u9879\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u65b0\u76f8\u673a\u5c06\u4e8e\u4eca\u5929\u5f00\u59cb\u9500\u552e\uff0c\u552e\u4ef750\u7f8e\u5143\u3002", "note_en": "The Raspberry Pi Foundation has announced a new camera board that should dramatically improve the photographic capabilities available to the popular DIY computer\u2019s enthusiasts and hobbyists. It\u2019s called the  High Quality Camera, and it\u2019s built around a 12.3-megapixel backside-illuminated Sony IMX477 sensor with 1.55-micron pixels.\n There have been official Raspberry Pi camera boards before, but they used much smaller, lower resolution sensors and relied on fixed-focus lenses. The High Quality Camera, however, supports interchangeable C- and CS-mount lenses and offers adjustable back focus. The first options to be available through approved resellers include a $25 6mm CS-mount lens and a $50 16mm C-mount lens.\n The board has a CS mount but comes with a C-mount adapter. This means that it\u2019ll be easy to attach a wide variety of lenses through third-party products. Here, for example, is what the board looks like with a Canon 70-200mm f/2.8, which is probably not a good idea but awesome anyway:\n   Raspberry Pi owners have been using camera modules for projects ranging from home security systems to DIY drone setups. Raspberry Pi Press is publishing a new guide to using cameras with the Pi,  available today for \u00a310 ($12.50) in print or  free as a PDF.\n The High Quality Camera is compatible with all Raspberry Pi computers from the 1 Model B onward, and the previous 8-megapixel camera module will continue to be available as a cheaper, smaller option. The new camera will  go on sale today for $50.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:42", "tags": "\u76f8\u673a,raspberry pi,\u66f4\u6362,pi,camera", "title":

"note_en": "We\u2019re pleased to announce a new member of the Raspberry Pi camera family: the 12.3-megapixel High Quality Camera,  available today for just $50, alongside a range of interchangeable lenses starting at $25.\n 12.3 megapixel Sony IMX477 sensor, 7.9mm diagonal image size, and back-illuminated sensor architecture, with adjustable back focus and support for C- and CS-\u2026\n  It\u2019s really rather good, as you can see from this shot of Cambridge\u2019s finest bit of perpendicular architecture.\n     There has always been a big overlap between Raspberry Pi hackers and camera hackers. Even back in 2012, people (okay, substantially  Dave Hunt) were  finding  interesting  ways to squeeze more functionality out of DSLR cameras using their Raspberry Pi computers.\n   In 2013, we  launched our first camera board, built around the OmniVision OV5647 5\u2011megapixel sensor, followed rapidly by the original Pi NoIR board, with infrared sensitivity and a little magic square of blue plastic. Before long, people were attaching them to  telescopes and using them to monitor plant health from  drones (using the aforementioned little square of plastic).\n  Sadly, OV5647 went end-of-life in 2015, and the 5-megapixel camera has the distinction of being one of only three products (along with the original Raspberry Pi 1 and the official WiFi dongle) that we\u2019ve ever discontinued.  Its replacement, built around the 8-megapixel Sony IMX219 sensor, launched in April 2016; it has found a home in all sorts of cool projects, from line-followers to  cucumber sorters, ever since. Going through our sales figures while writing this post, we were amazed to discover  ...\n  Versatile though they are, there are limitations to mobile phone-type fixed-focus modules. The sensors themselves are relatively small, which translates into a lower signal-to-noise ratio and poorer low-light performance; and of course there is no option to replace the lens assembly with a more expensive one, or one with different optical properties. These are the shortcomings that the High Quality Camera is designed to address.\n       1.55\u03bcm \u00d7 1.55\u03bcm pixel size \u2013 double the pixel area of IMX219\n 12.3 megapixel Sony IMX477 sensor, 7.9mm diagonal sensor size, and back-illuminated sensor architecture, with adjustable back focus and support for C- and CS\u2026\n  We expect that over time people will use quite a wide variety of lenses, but for starters our Approved Resellers will be offering a couple of options: a 6 mm CS\u2011mount lens at $25, and a very shiny 16 mm C-mount lens priced at $50.\n   Also out today is our new  Official Raspberry Pi Camera Guide, covering both the familiar Raspberry Pi Camera Module and the new Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera.\n  Our new guide, published by  Raspberry Pi Press, walks you through setting up and using your camera with your Raspberry Pi computer. You\u2019ll also learn how to use filters and effects to enhance your photos and videos, and how to set up creative projects such as stop-motion animation stations, wildlife cameras, smart doorbells, and much more.\n  You can purchase the book in print today  from the Raspberry Pi Press store for \u00a310, or download the  PDF for free from The MagPi magazine website.\n  As with every product we build, the High Quality Camera has taught us interesting new things, in this case about producing precision-machined aluminium components at scale (and to think we thought injection moulding was hard!). Getting this right has been something of a labour of love for me over the past three years, designing the hardware and getting it to production. Naush Patuck tuned the VideoCore IV ISP for this sensor; David Plowman helped with lens evaluation; Phil King  ...\n We\u2019d like to acknowledge Phil Holden at Sony in San Jose, the manufacturing team at Sony UK Tec in Pencoed for their camera test and assembly expertise, and Shenzhen O-HN Optoelectronic for solving our precision engineering challenges.\n   The High Quality Camera is compatible with almost all Raspberry Pi models, from the original Raspberry Pi 1 Model B onward. Some very early Raspberry Pi Zero boards from the start of 2016 lack a camera connector, and other Zero users will need the same adapter FPC that is used with Camera Module v2.\n  The regular and infrared versions of Camera Module v2 will still be available. The High Quality Camera does not supersede it. Instead, it provides a different tradeoff between price, performance, and size.\n  You can use C- and CS-mount lenses out of the box (C-mount lenses use the included C-CS adapter). Third-party adapters are available from a wide variety of lens standards to CS-mount, so it is possible to connect any lens that meets the back\u2011focus requirements.\n We\u2019re looking forward to seeing the oldest and/or weirdest lenses anyone can get working, but here\u2019s one for starters, courtesy of  Fiacre.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:38", "tags": "\u76f8\u673a,raspberry

"note_en": "This approach, which relies on the willingness of Swedes to abide by distancing guidelines, has drawn praise from the WHO\n Sweden&#39;s experiment seeking to confer &#34;herd immunity&#34; against COVID-19 on its population -- and not relying heavily on\u00a0movement restrictions and strict social distancing -- isn&#39;t going well for its senior citizens.\n Its relaxed approach compared to its locked down Nordic neighbors relies mostly on residents voluntarily complying with strict but voluntary distancing standards. Sweden, which has a population of 10 million, has also banned gatherings of more than 50 people, but has allowed shops, bars and primary schools to remain open.\n It has now, however, barred visits to nursing homes and ordered people over 70 to self-isolate if they feel ill. Unfortunately, senior citizens are being infected by nursing home staff that can freely move about in society.\n As a result, one-in-three COVID-19 deaths has taken place in care facilities for the elderly, admitted Dr.  Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist and the architect of the country&#39;s relaxed approach to dealing with the pandemic.\n  Sweden\u2019s loose restrictions were assailed by 2,300 academics that signed a letter last month calling for the government to reconsider its controversial approach.\n \u201cWe must establish control over the situation, we cannot head into a situation where we get complete chaos. No one has tried this route, so why should we test it first in Sweden, without informed consent?\u201d said Cecilia Soderberg-Naucler, a professor at the Karolinska Institute.\n Despite these alarming realities, Sweden&#39;s approach was still lauded by the World Health Organization (WHO). Surprisingly, WHO has praised Sweden as a \u201cmodel\u201d for battling COVID-19.\n   There are \u201clessons to be learned\u201d from Sweden, which is relying on the self-discipline of its citizens to defeat the pandemic, contended\u00a0 Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO&#39;s Health Emergencies Program, which is responsible for the international containment and treatment of COVID-19.\n \u201cI think there\u2019s a perception out that Sweden has not put in control measures and just has allowed the disease to spread,\u201d noted Dr. Ryan. \u201cNothing can be further from the truth.\u201d\n On Wednesday, Dr. Ryan told the media instead of lockdowns, Sweden has \u201cput in place a very strong public policy around social distancing, around caring and protecting people in long term care facilities.\u201d\n   He said what Sweden has done differently is to rely heavily on its relationship with its citizenry and the ability and willingness of Swedes to implement self-distancing and self-regulate.\n \u201cIn that sense, they have implemented public policy through that partnership with the population,\u201d according to Dr. Ryan.\n He also pointed out Sweden has accelerated coronavirus testing while having adequate hospital capacity to cope with any spike in cases.\n \u201cI think if we are to reach a new normal, Sweden represents a model if we wish to get back to a society in which we don\u2019t have lockdowns,\u201d claimed Dr. Ryan.\n Sweden ranks 21st on the list of the most heavily infected countries in the world. It had 20,302 confirmed cases and 2,462 deaths as of 05:48 GMT on Thursday. This total is far higher than its Nordic neighbors of Norway, Denmark and Finland.\n Denmark, with a population of 5.8 million, reports 9,206 cases and 443 deaths. Norway has 7,680 cases and 207 deaths among 5.4 million. Finland has 4,906 cases and 206 deaths out of a population of 5.5 million.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:31", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u7ec4\u7ec7,sweden,\u745e\u5178",

"note_en": "Zoom has admitted it doesn\u2019t have 300 million daily active users. The admission came after  The Verge noticed the company had quietly edited a blog post making the claim earlier this month. Zoom  originally stated it had \u201cmore than 300 million daily users\u201d and that \u201cmore than 300 million people around the world are using Zoom during this challenging time.\u201d Zoom later  deleted these references from the original blog post, and now claims \u201c300 million daily Zoom meeting participants.\u201d\n The difference between a daily active user (DAU) and \u201cmeeting participant\u201d is significant. Daily meeting participants can be counted multiple times: if you have five Zoom meetings in a day then you\u2019re counted five times. A DAU is counted once per day, and is commonly used by companies to measure service usage. Only counting meeting participants is an easy, somewhat misleading, way to make your platform usage seem larger than it is.\n The misleading blog was edited on April 24th, a day after the numbers made headlines worldwide. After  The Verge reached out for comment from Zoom, the company added a note to the blog post admitting the error yesterday, and provided the following statement:\n \u201cWe are humbled and proud to help over 300 million daily meeting participants stay connected during this pandemic. In a blog post on April 22, we unintentionally referred to these participants as \u201cusers\u201d and \u201cpeople.\u201d When we realized this error, we adjusted the wording to \u201cparticipants.\u201d This was a genuine oversight on our part.\u201d\n Zoom\u2019s growth has been impressive, but the company has not actually provided a daily active user count. Zoom usage has soared from 10 million daily meeting participants back in December to 300 million this month. Rivals like Microsoft Teams and Google Meet appear to be closing the gap, though. Microsoft said yesterday it now has  75 million daily active users of Teams, a jump from 70 percent in a month. Microsoft also recorded 200 million meeting participants in a single day this month.\n Google Meet is adding roughly 3 million new users each day, and hit  over 100 million daily Meet meeting participants recently. Cisco also revealed earlier this month that it has a total of 300 million Webex users, and saw sign-ups close to 240,000 in a 24-hour period. Cisco has not yet provided daily meeting participant numbers, or daily active user counts.\n Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and others are still  chasing Zoom with new features and free services. Google made its Meet service free this week, and both Microsoft and Google have increased how many people you can see simultaneously in response to Zoom\u2019s popular gallery view.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:53:26", "tags": "\u6570\u5b57,meeting,zoom", "title": "Zoom\u66f4\u6b63\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b57\uff1a\u79f0\u6bcf\u5929\u67093\u4ebf\u4f1a\u8bae\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005", "title_en": "Zoom corrects usage numbers: says it has 300M daily meeting participants", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242421/zoom-300-million-users-incorrect-meeting-participants-statement", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u6570\u5b57", "meeting", "zoom"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "21bcbfd65bbeb91b79a525a38c323e78.jpg", "infoid": 1000138, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6309\u7167\u60ef\u4f8b\uff0c\u7a7a\u519b\u4e0d\u4f1a\u900f\u9732X-37B\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8f7d\u8377\u3002\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u5bf9OTV-5\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e86\u4f8b\u5916\u3002\u6267\u884c\u90a3\u6b21\u4efb\u52a1\u7684X-37B\u642d\u8f7d\u4e86\u7531\u7a7a\u519b\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5236\u9020\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u70ed\u6563\u5e03\u5668\u3002\u6839\u636e\u7a7a\u519b\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u6563\u5e03\u5668\u5e2e\u52a9\u201c\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u548c\u632f\u8361\u70ed\u7ba1\u6280\u672f\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff1a\u201cX-37B\u672c\u8eab\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u957f\uff0c\u8fd9\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9X-37B\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u2026\u2026", "note_en": "The Air Force as a matter of habit does not disclose the X-37B\u2019s payloads.

Working closely with cutting-edge deep learning teams across a variety of industries, a clear narrative emerged: without better infrastructure, training deep learning models at scale remains extremely difficult, as organizations move from research to production. This feedback led us to build the Determined Training Platform, which now powers teams of Deep Learning Engineers and large GPU clusters  ...\n Our innovative infrastructure platform is now ready for widespread adoption, and we\u2019re excited to share it with the DL community! Today we are announcing that  we have  open sourced our deep learning training platform under the Apache 2.0 license.\n  We designed the  Determined Training Platform to empower Deep Learning Engineers to focus on the task at hand \u2014 training high-quality models. To achieve this goal, our platform tightly integrates all of the features that a DL engineer needs to train models at scale, including:\n  High-performance distributed training that just works.Determined \u2019s distributed training support builds upon Horovod, a popular distributed training framework, but includes a suite of optimizations that results in twice the performance of stock Horovod. Moreover, Determined \u2019s distributed training support is easy to set up (no code changes are needed to move from single-GPU to distributed training), and allows multiple users to seamlessly share the same GPU cluster.
