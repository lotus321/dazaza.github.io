"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  De-extinction, also known as  resurrection biology, or  species revivalism, is the process of generating an  organism that is either an extinct species or resembles an  extinct species.  [1] There are several ways to carry out the process of de-extinction.  Cloning is the most widely proposed method, although genome editing and  selective breeding have also been considered. Similar techniques have been applied to certain  endangered species, in hopes to boost populations.  ...\n     Cloning is a commonly suggested method for the potential restoration of an extinct species. It can be done by extracting the nucleus from a preserved cell from the extinct species and swapping it into an egg, without a nucleus, of that species&#39; nearest living relative.  [3]The egg can then be inserted into a host from the extinct species \u2019nearest living relative. It is important to note that this method can only be used when a preserved cell is available,  ...\n  Genome editing has been rapidly advancing with the help of the CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was originally discovered as part of the bacterial immune system.  [6]Viral DNA that was injected into the bacterium became incorporated into the bacterial chromosome at specific regions. These regions are called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, otherwise known as CRISPR. Since the viral DNA is within  ...\n By using cells from a closely related species to the extinct species, genome editing can play a role in the de-extinction process. Germ cells may be edited directly, so that the egg and sperm produced by the extant parent species will produce offspring of the extinct species, or somatic cells may be edited and transferred via somatic cell nuclear transfer. This results in a hybrid between the two species, since it is not completely one animal. Because  ...\n  Back breeding is a form of selective breeding. As opposed to breeding animals for a trait to advance the species in selective breeding, back breeding involves breeding animals for an ancestral characteristic that may not be seen throughout the species as frequently.  [7] This method can recreate the traits of an extinct species, but the genome will differ from the original species.  [4]Back breeding, however, is contingent on the ancestral trait of the  ...\n  A natural process of de-extinction is iterative evolution. This process occurs when a species becomes extinct, but then reappears after some amount of time. An example of this process occurred with the  white-throated rail. This flightless bird became extinct approximately 136,000 years ago due to an unknown event that caused sea levels to rise, which resulted in the demise of the species. The species reappeared about 100,000 years ago when sea levels  ...\n  The technologies being developed for de-extinction could lead to large advancements in scientific technology and process. This includes the advancement of genetic technologies that are used to improve the cloning process for de-extinction. The technologies could be used to prevent endangered species form going extinct.  [11]The study of reintroduced spices could also lead to advancements in science. By studying previously extinct animals cures to diseases  ...\n If de-extinction is prioritized it would lead to the improvement of current conservation strategies. Conservation would be necessary in order to reintroduce a species into the ecosystem. Conservation efforts would be taken initially until the revived population can sustain itself in the wild.  [14]De-extinction could also help improve ecosystems that had been destroyed by human development by introducing an extinct species back into an ecosystem to  ...\n  The reintroduction of previously extinct spices could have negative impact on the ecosystem and other species, Since the species was previously extinct reintroducing it into an ecosystem it could be seen as an invasive species. This could lead to the extinction of living species due to competition for food or  competitive exclusion. It could also lead to the extinction of prey species if they have more predictors in an environment that had few predictors  ...\n De-extinction is a very expensive process. Bringing back one species can coast millions of dollars. The money for de-extinction would most likely come from current conservation efforts. These efforts could be weakened if funding is taken from conservation and put into de-extinction. This would mean that  critically endangeredspecies would start to go extinct faster because there is no longer resources that are need to maintain their populations.  ...\n      The existence of preserved soft tissue remains and  DNA from  woolly mammoths has led to the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Two methods have been proposed to achieve this. The first would be to use the cloning process, because even the most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough DNA intact to guide the production of an embryo.  [20]The second method  ...\n In March 2014, the  Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists reported that blood recovered from a frozen mammoth carcass in 2013 would now provide a good opportunity for cloning the woolly mammoth.  [21] Another way to create a living woolly mammoth would be to migrate genes from the mammoth genome into the genes of its closest living relative, the  Asian elephant, to create hybridized animals with the notable adaptations that it had for living  ...\n George Church has hypothesized the positive effects of bringing back the extinct woolly mammoth would have on the environment, such as the potential for reversing some of the damage caused by  global warming.  [26]He and his fellow researchers predict that mammoths would eat the dead grass allowing the sun to reach the spring grass; their weight would allow them to break through dense, insulating snow in order to let cold air reach the soil; and  ...\n  The  Pyrenean ibex was a subspecies of  Spanish ibex that roamed on the Iberian peninsula. While it was abundant up to the  Medieval times, over-hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries led to its demise. In 1999, only a single female named Celia was left alive in  Ordesa National Park. Scientists captured her, took a tissue sample from her ear, collared her, then released her back into the wild, where she lived until she was found dead in 2000, having  ...\n   The  aurochs was widespread across Eurasia, North Africa, and the Indian subcontinent during the  Pleistocene, but only the European aurochs (  Bos primigenius primigenius) survived into historic times.  [30] This species is heavily featured in European cave paintings, such as  Lascaux and  Chauvet cave in France,  [31] and was still widespread during the  Roman era. Following the fall of the  Roman empire, overhunting of the aurochs by nobility caused  ...\n  The  quagga ( Equus quagga quagga) is a subspecies of the  plains zebra that was distinct in that it was striped on its face and upper torso, but its rear abdomen was a solid brown. It was native to  South Africa, but was wiped out in the wild due to overhunting for sport, and the last individual died in 1883 in the Amsterdam Zoo.  [38]However, since it is technically the same species as the surviving plains zebra, it has been argued that the quagga  ...\n   The  thylacine was native to the  Australian mainland,  Tasmania and  New Guinea. It is believed to have become  extinct in the 20th century. The thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the  Australian mainland before  British settlement of the continent. The last known thylacine, named Benjamin, died at the  Hobart Zoo, on September 7, 1936. It is believed to have died as the result of neglect \u2014locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters,  ...\n In December 2017 it was announced in  Nature Ecology and Evolution that the full nuclear genome of the thylacine had been successfully sequenced, marking the completion of the critical first step toward de-extinction that began in 2008, with the extraction of the DNA samples from the preserved pouch specimen.  [43] The Thylacine genome was reconstructed by using the genome editing method. The  Tasmanian devilwas used as a reference for the  ...\n   The  passenger pigeonnumbered in the billions before being wiped out due to commercial hunting and habitat loss. The non-profit Revive &amp; Restore obtained DNA from the passenger pigeon from museum specimens and skins; however, this DNA is degraded because it is so old. For this reason, simple cloning would not be an effective way to perform de-extinction for this species because parts of the genome would be missing. Instead, Revive &amp;  ...\n   Moa \u2013 this group of large (up to 4\u00a0m\u00a0[12\u00a0ft] tall and 110\u00a0kg\u00a0[250\u00a0lb]), flightless birds became extinct in approximately 1400 AD following the arrival and proliferation of the  Maori people on New Zealand; however, intact DNA from both preserved specimens and eggshells makes the moa a candidate for resurrection.  [46] [   failed verification] New Zealand politician  Trevor Mallard has suggested bringing back a medium-sized species.  [47]\n Heath hen \u2013 this subspecies of the  prairie chicken became extinct on  Martha&#39;s Vineyard in 1932 despite conservation efforts; however, the availability of usable DNA in museum specimens and protected areas in its former range makes this bird a possible candidate for de-extinction and reintroduction to its former habitat.  [48]\n Dodo \u2013 this large, flightless ground bird endemic to  Mauritius became extinct in the 1640s, less than a century after it was discovered, due to exploitation by humans and due to  introduced speciessuch as rats and pigs, which ate their eggs, and has since become a symbol of extinction in popular culture. Due to a wealth of bones and some tissues, it is possible that this species may live again as it has a close relative in the surviving  ...\n Elephant bird \u2013 of the largest birds to have ever existed, the elephant bird was driven to extinction by the early colonization of Madagascar. Ancient DNA has been obtained from the eggshells but may be too degraded for use in de-extinction.  [51]\n  Cave lion \u2013 The discovery of two preserved cubs in the  Sakha Republic ignited a project to clone the animal.  [52]\n Steppe bison \u2013 The discovery of the mummified steppe bison of 9,000 years ago could help people clone the ancient bison species back, even though the steppe bison would not be the first to be &#34;resurrected&#34;.  [53]\n Tarpan \u2013 A subspecies of wild horse that went extinct in 1909. Much like the aurochs, there have been many attempts to breed tarpan-like horses, the first being by the Heck brothers, creating the  Heck horse as a result. Though it is not a genetic copy, it is claimed to bear many similarities to the tarpan.  [54]Other attempts were made to create tarpan-like horses. A breeder named Harry Hegardt was able to breed a line of horses from  ...\n  Macrauchenia \u2013 The DNA of  Macrauchenia, which has been discovered in 2017, makes it possible for  Macrauchenia to be cloned.  [56]\n  Floreana Island tortoise \u2013 In 2008, mitochondrial DNA from the Floreana tortoise species was found in museum specimens. In theory, a breeding programme could be established to &#34;resurrect&#34; a pure Floreana species from living hybrids.  [57]  [58]\n  Gastric-brooding frog \u2013 In 2013, scientists in Australia successfully created a living embryo from non-living preserved genetic material, and hopes by using somatic-cell nuclear transfer methods, they can produce an embryo that can survive to the tadpole stage.

"note_en": "Microsoft has detailed one more area where it&#39;s engineers are using the Mozilla-created Rust programming language, a new project from a team at Azure to test WebAssembly modules in Kubernetes.\n Microsoft is already experimenting with Rust to  rewrite low-level components of Windows originally written in C and C++, and is also looking to Rust&#39;s memory-safety features to create a new language  for &#39;safe infrastructure programming&#39; under Project Verona.\n    DeisLabs, an Azure incubator for creating Kubernetes tools, has also used Rust to build  Krustlet, a &#39;kubelet&#39; than lets developers run multiple WebAssembly modules (Wasm) in Kubernetes, the dominant open-source tool for managing Docker containers.\n     &#34;While there have been many stories about using Rust for systems-level programming, you don&#39;t often hear stories about cloud software  or Kubernetes software being written in Rust. So, we wanted to explain why we made the choice we did,&#34;  writes Taylor Thomas, a senior software engineer at DeisLabs, Azure.\n The Krustlet project, which  emerged earlier this month, is &#34;highly experimental&#34;, with DeisLabs warning that &#34;you should use it in production at your own risk&#34;.\n   WebAssembly, an open standard supported by all major browsers, has primarily been used for creating powerful web applications that run in the browser. The main reason DeisLabs chose Rust for Krustlet is because Rust has native build support for compiled Wasm binaries or modules.\n But Microsoft is forging ahead with Rust-based Krustlet to help developers push WebAssembly code outside the browser, in support of  Mozilla&#39;s release last year of the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI), so that compilers can target a single interface rather than multiple operating systems.\n Developers can use Krustlet to test-drive WebAssembly modules in Kubernetes alongside containers within &#34;constrained and security-conscious environments&#34; where containers typically are challenged.\n DeisLabs developers also chose Rust because of its &#34;strong safety and security guarantees&#34;. Despite early troubles with Rust that put a drag on productivity they realized they could save time downstream by not exposing null pointers, thread safety issues, and other bugs. And they argue they were able to significantly reduce the efficiency gap between programming in Rust compared with Go.\n &#34;For the first week or so, we lost much of our time to learning how  borrows worked. After about two weeks, we were back up to 50% efficiency compared to us writing in Go. After a month, we all were comfortable enough that we were back up to full efficiency (in terms of how much code we could write),&#34; writes Thomas.\n &#34;However, we noticed that we gained productivity in the sense that we didn&#39;t spend as much time manually checking specific conditions, like null pointers, or not having to debug as many problems.&#34;\n On the issue of security versus missing features in Rust, Thomas highlights a recently discovered race condition in Helm, which was written in Go and was not picked up by the race checker for Go. But, he says, the bug would definitely have been caught by the Rust compiler.\n &#34;Even though we sometimes miss having a garbage collector so we don&#39;t have to worry about cloning, borrowing, ownership, etc., the pain we have avoided because of the Rust compiler&#39;s strict rules is incalculable,&#34; said Thomas.\n &#34;For comparison, last week\u00a0 we caught a significant race condition\u00a0in another Kubernetes-related project we maintain called\u00a0 Helm\u00a0(written in Go) that has been there for a year or more, and which passed the race checker for Go. That error would never have escaped the Rust compiler, preventing the bug from ever existing in the first place.&#34;\n Ralph Squillace, a principal program manager on Azure application platform upstream, said: &#34;Using Rust to build Kubernetes components was a wonderful experience compared to Go, and it should be much more widely adopted for Kubernetes work.&#34;\n  But Thomas said Rust still had obvious problems, including the length of time required to learn it.\n &#34;One of the biggest ones to point out is that async runtimes are still a bit unclear,&#34; noted Thomas. He also said the learning curve was difficult, which chimes with top obstacles to Rust adoption  revealed in Rustlang&#39;s most recent survey of developers.\n &#34;It takes several weeks of hard effort learning how to code properly in Rust before the learning curve levels out. However, that hard effort up front pays off in dividends due to the aforementioned safety features,&#34; said Thomas.\n &#34;We also noticed that once developers are over that initial curve, they are able to contribute to code just as easily as with any other language. Just be aware that there will be some initial pain.&#34;\n Nonetheless, Microsoft&#39;s Azure engineers intend to continue using Rust for projects where it&#39;s a good fit and &#34;highly recommend&#34; it for upcoming cloud projects.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:48:38", "tags": "rust,\u7a0b\u5e8f,\u7f16\u7a0b,app,programming language", "title":

"note_en": "Jitsi is an open source app for videoconferencing and chat. Works with Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and Android clients.\n Droplets created by using this image allow videoconference between Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS users, just requiring to open a new browser tab on laptops/desktops or to install the Jitsi app from the Play Store/App Store on mobile.\n This is a pre-configured image with pre-configured Jitsi and NGINX. Ypu&#39;ll only need a domain and we provide scripts for an effortless setup with HTTPS for secure communication for your team.\n It is recommended to run this image on a  CPU-Optimized droplet with at least 4GB of RAM or higher.\n   Before accessing the fresh droplet, add a domain to your project. This is required because most browsers require HTTPS in order to allow you to use the camera and microphone in a website, and it&#39;s not possible to enable HTTPS just with an IP.\n  It is mandatory to add an A record (i.e. jitsi-example.digitalocean.com) pointing to the IP associated with your droplet.\n  Access the console (i.e via ssh by running  ssh root@123.456.789) and set a new password.\n  We have created scripts to configure Jitsi in a very straightforward way. This is divided in two steps:\n     The menu will ask you to type the domain you added to your project in step 2. Type it exactly the same (i.e. jitsi-example.digitalocean.com), if you insert the droplet IP you  won&#39;t be able to configure HTTPS in the next step.\n Then select the option to generate a self-signed certificate, unless you want import your own certificate.\n    The menu will ask you for an email, it will be used to notify you when it&#39;s time to renew the certificates and maintain your website with a secure connection.\n Here&#39;s an excellent guide if you have questions with respect to HTTPS and encryption:  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04\n  Connect to the host via the hostname you set up in the earlier. Just open a browser tab and visit  jitsi-example.digitalocean.com (i.e. the domain that you previously configured).\n  (Optional) Use SSH keys instead of typed passwords to enter your server via SSH. See the details here:  https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/\n (Optional) Configure an application such as Google Authenticator to provide a dynamic additional password for SSH access. See the details here:  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-protect-ssh-with-two-factor-authentication\n  In addition to creating a Droplet from the Jitsi Server 1-Click App via the control panel, you can also use the   DigitalOcean API.\n As an example, to create a 4GB Jitsi Server Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following curl command. You\u2019ll need to either save your   API access token to an environment variable or substitute it into the command below.\n curl -X POST -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; \\ -H

"note_en": "So it happened again: I feel being patronized by a large SW vendor who forces me to automatically run his software on my system after each login. As an open source developer and advocate I hate if I don\u2019t have control over these kind of things and no option to turn them off. Unix know-how to the rescue, though. Read on.\n The members of a project I am currently working on to make a living are now widespread over the country due to the coronavirus pandemic. Project management has decided that the communication should happen over a product called skype. It\u2019s not free and open, but hey, come on, I have to make some money somehow so that I can manage it with  KMyMoney. Fortunately, I found out that there is a version for Linux and it even works quite well.\n Nevertheless, I wondered why it starts after login without me doing anything. OK, this could be the default setting and I started the  KDE system settings to turn it off. Not thinking about it further, I started and stopped skype for a few days until there was a kernel update and I had to reboot my system.\n After login, I was surprised that skype started automatically. I thought, I had turned it off. Well, unmark that checkbox again in system settings and guess what: it returned without me doing anything except starting and using the application. That  ~/.config/autostart/skypeforlinux.desktop file, which is responsible for the autostart, just re-appeared every time one starts skype manually.\n Using the search engine of choice, I learned that this is a known problem and cannot be turned off with an option. This is the time, when patronization starts and I get angry.\n Visiting a few web pages I learned that people have developed different methods to solve the issue:\n create a directory with the name of the desktop file to avoid creation of the file itself\n and maybe some more I don\u2019t remember. All in all, they are not really what I like on my system.\n Next, I thought they will recreate the file only in case it does not exist. I changed  X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true to  X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false which should do the trick. Guess what: start skype, quit and the setting is back to  true. Changing  Exec=/usr/bin/skypeforlinux to  Exec=/usr/bin/true had the same effect: none.\n This is the moment in time when I really get angry and p\u2026.: I set options and someone else discards them. OK Microsoft, how about the next ace in my sleeve:\n  and that does it. And if you think you can override that in a future version, I will make root the owner of that file.\n Oh, and the Microsoft Teams client for Linux does the same crap but the solution works the same way.\n   As a response to the above blog entry I received a mail that explained how to turn off the autostart using a setting on the General settings tab within skype.

"note_en": "New data from space is providing the most precise picture yet of Antarctica\u2019s ice, where it is accumulating most quickly and disappearing at the fastest rate, and how the changes could contribute to rising sea levels.\n  The information, in a  paper published on Thursday in the journal Science, will help researchers better understand the largest driver of ice loss in Antarctica, the thinning of floating ice shelves that allows more ice to flow from the interior to the ocean, and how that will contribute to rising sea levels. Researchers have known for a long time that, while the continent is  losing mass over all as the climate changes, the change is uneven. It is gaining more ice in some areas, like parts  ...\n Helen A. Fricker, an author of the paper, said that scientists have tried to study the link between thinning shelves and what is called grounded ice, but have been hampered because most observations were of one area or the other, and made at different times. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got it all on the same map, which is a really powerful thing,\u201d said Dr. Fricker, a glaciologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.\n The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2, or ICESat-2, was launched in 2018 as part of NASA \u2019s Earth Observing System. It replaced a satellite that had provided data from 2003 to 2009. ICESat-2 uses a laser altimeter, which fires pulses of photons split into six beams toward the Earth \u2019s surface 300 miles below. Of the trillions of photons in each pulse, only a handful of reflected ones are detected back at the satellite. Extremely precise measurement of these photons \u2019travel times  ...\n \u201cIt\u2019s not like any instrument that we\u2019ve had in space before,\u201d said another of the authors, Alex S. Gardner, a glaciologist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. The resolution is so high that it can detect rifts and other small features of the ice surface, he said.\n The coast of West Antarctica is rapidly losing mass as warm water melts ice shelves from below and icebergs break off.\n   The coast of West Antarctica is rapidly losing mass as warm water melts ice shelves from below and icebergs break off.\n   The coast of West Antarctica is rapidly losing mass as warm water melts ice shelves from below and icebergs break off.\n The researchers used the elevation measurements from both satellites to determine how Antarctica\u2019s mass balance, the difference between accumulation and loss, changed from 2003 to 2019 for each of its 27 drainage basins. Over all, they reported that the continent had lost enough ice to raise sea levels by six millimeters, or about one-quarter of an inch, during that time period.\n While that finding is consistent with other studies that used data from other instruments, \u201cin a lot of ways this is a more definitive measurement,\u201d said Ben Smith, a glaciologist at the University of Washington and an author of the study. \u201cIt shows a set of differences that we can really understand in detail and know what they mean for the ice sheets.\u201d\n Ice loss was limited to West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula; the bigger East Antarctic sheet gained mass over that time. The East Antarctic increase is likely because of increased precipitation, Dr. Gardner said. \u201cWhile we can\u2019t say that these changes are related to contemporary climate change, we can say that these are the patterns of change we expect to see in a warming world,\u201d he said.\n Increased precipitation in the form of snow leads to an increase in ice sheet mass because, as snow compresses over time, it turns to ice.\n Thinning ice shelves in West Antarctica allow ice on land to move toward the ocean, which can raise sea levels.\n   Thinning ice shelves in West Antarctica allow ice on land to move toward the ocean, which can raise sea levels.\n   Thinning ice shelves in West Antarctica allow ice on land to move toward the ocean, which can raise sea levels.\n Floating ice shelves accounted for 30 percent of the ice loss in West Antarctica, the researchers found.\n Floating ice is lost in two ways: by calving of icebergs and through melting from underneath by a deep current of warmer water that circulates around the continent.\n Floating ice is, by definition, already in the water, so when it calves or melts it does not add to sea level rise. But ice shelves act as buttresses against the grounded ice behind them; when they thin they allow that ice to flow faster. And when the previously grounded ice reaches the water, it adds to rising seas.\n Scientists are increasingly concerned that the loss of floating ice in West Antarctica is causing more rapid flow of grounded ice in the West Antarctic ice sheet, and that a portion of the sheet could collapse over centuries, greatly increasing sea levels.\n The study looked at changes in the Greenland ice sheet as well. Unlike Antarctica, where little ice is lost through surface melting and runoff, as much as two-thirds of Greenland\u2019s ice is lost this way.\n Using their elevation data, the researchers found that Greenland is losing about 200 billion tons of mass each year on average. That\u2019s enough to raise sea levels by about eight millimeters, or a third of an inch, over the study period.\n  The study is the first to be published using data from ICESat-2, which was designed to have an operating life of at least three years. Many more studies are expected that should add to the understanding of Earth\u2019s frozen expanses.\n \u201cWhere we\u2019re at in ice sheet science is, there are still a lot of unknowns,\u201d Dr. Gardner said. One advantage of ICESat-2, he said, is its ability to measure changes in some of the smallest ice sheet features.

"note_en": "Scientists working for the  US military have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease, the Guardian has learned.\n In what could be a significant breakthrough, project coordinators hope the blood-based test will be able to detect the virus\u2019s presence as early as 24 hours after infection \u2013 before people show symptoms and several days before a carrier is considered capable of spreading it to other people. That is also around four days before current tests can detect the virus.\n The test has emerged from a project set up by the US military\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) aimed at rapid diagnosis of germ or chemical warfare poisoning. It was hurriedly repurposed when the pandemic broke out and the new test is expected to be put forward for emergency use approval (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within a week.\n \u201cThe concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide,\u201d the head of Darpa\u2019s biological technologies office, Dr Brad Ringeisen, told the Guardian, since it should also fill in testing gaps at later stages of the infection. If given FDA approval, he said, it had the potential to be \u201cabsolutely a gamechanger\u201d.\n  While pre-infectious detection would improve the efficiency of test-and-trace programmes as governments worldwide relax lockdowns, Darpa cautioned that it must wait until after FDA approval is given and the test can be put into practise for evidence of exactly how early it can pick up the virus.\n \u201cThe goal of research is to develop and validate an early host blood response diagnostic test for Covid,\u201d Prof Stuart Sealfon, who leads the research team at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, said in an email.\n He said the testing approach, which looks at the body\u2019s response as it fights Covid-19, should produce earlier results than current nose-swab tests that hunt for the virus itself. \u201cBecause the immune response to infection develops immediately after infection, a Covid signature is expected to provide more sensitive Covid infection diagnosis earlier,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n The research behind the development of the tests will eventually be made public, with the collaborating teams from medical schools at Mount Sinai, Duke University and Princeton expected to publish online, allowing scientists around the world to trial similar methods.\n If EUA is granted, the test should start being rolled out in the US in the second half of May. Approval is not guaranteed, but Darpa scientists are enthusiastic about the potential impact as governments loosen lockdowns amid worries about controlling potential second-wave outbreaks.\n  \u201cWe are all extremely excited. We want to roll this test out as quickly as we can, but at the same time share with others who might want to implement in their own countries,\u201d said Dr Eric Van Gieson, who set up Darpa\u2019s epigenetic characterization and observation (Echo) programme last year to diagnose biological warfare victims, and has redirected it to focus on Covid-19. Epigenetics looks at a set of controls on genes that can respond to the environment.\n Hope that the test might pick up carriers before they become infectious is based on previous research into other viruses, though Sealfon said this remained \u201cunknown\u201d for Covid-19.\n \u201cWe have evidence that diagnosis happens in the first 24 hours for influenza and an adenovirus,\u201d Van Gieson said. \u201cWe are still in the midst of proving that with Covid-19. That said, we should know very soon after EUA.\u201d He sees potential for the US to carry out up to a million tests a day, starting with 100,000 daily in May.\n The test would up up the possibility of isolating pre-infectious cases and closing down transmission chains. It could also dramatically reduce quarantine periods for people exposed to Covid-19 spreaders, allowing them to go back to work within days. \u201cIt could have exceptional demand, \u201dsaid Chris Linthwaite, the chief executive of Fluidigm, a California life-sciences technology company that is part of the project, who believes frequent testing can help manage workforces as they return  ...\n The UK government announced plans two weeks ago to restart a contact-tracing programme that was abandoned early in the outbreak. Britain\u2019s stated target was  100,000   tests a day by the end of April. France announced on Tuesday that it would test 700,000 people a week, including those without symptoms.\n Other countries such as South Korea, Australia and New Zealand already have efficient tracing systems, but they would be boosted if carriers could be detected early.\n  Darpa experts also see potential to improve protocols for protecting health care workers and others in high-risk jobs, as well as those in relatively self-contained or isolated communities such as care homes and prisons or onboard ships.\n The test uses the same polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines used for checking nasal swabs from people suspected of having the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple tweak,\u201d said Van Gieson. \u201cThe infrastructure is already there.\u201d\n Limitations on use are similar to those already faced by countries such as Britain and depend on PCR capacity, stocks of chemical reagents and logistics. Results can take an hour, or longer if samples must be sent away to laboratories.\n Like the viral test, the new blood test hunts for a type of molecule called RNA. In this case it is messenger RNA (mRNA). \u201cTarget mRNA is part of the immune response to viral infection,\u201d Sealfon said. \u201cmRNA expression levels really do adjust due to the presence of Covid-19. Understanding the immune response is key to fighting Covid-19.\u201d\n Covid-19 is thought to incubate for about five days, at which stage people are assumed to become infectious. That is also when the virus can be detected by current nose swab tests. \u201cThey do the job, they just don\u2019t tell you someone is sick until maybe four days after this [new test],\u201d said Van Gieson.\n The research shows accuracy levels above 95%. \u201cThis is something that will need to be constantly monitored as it will inevitably change up or down,\u201d Van Gieson said.\n Blood samples are harder to collect than nose swabs, but may be more reliable. Swab testing can be difficult because it requires taking a sample from deep inside the nose.\n \u201cIt can throw up a lot of false negatives,\u201d said Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University, adding that recent studies showing low reliability were probably due to poor swab sampling. \u201cI\u2019ve been very concerned by pictures on the television of drive-in testing. Something you could measure reliably in blood could be a good thing.\u201d\n  Like all researchers contacted by the Guardian, however, he was unwilling to comment further until the Mount Sinai-led team published its research. Most were concerned about potential problems with accuracy and practicality. Blood collection is a potential limitation, since drive-in centres are not usually equipped to do this. One millilitre of blood \u2013 a fifth of a teaspoon \u2013 is needed.\n The research team is expected to publish the mRNA sequence, allowing others to create the so-called \u201cprimer\u201d required. A similar approach was taken when the genetic sequence of the virus itself was released by China in January, allowing tests to be developed rapidly in South Korea and elsewhere.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:48:09", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u7ec6\u83cc\u6218,warfare,\u68c0\u6d4b", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u7ec6\u83cc\u6218\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5bf9\u611f\u67d3\u524d\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u643a\u5e26\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b", "title_en": "US germ warfare lab creates test for pre-infectious Covid-19 carriers", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/us-germ-warfare-lab-creates-test-for-pre-infectious-covid-19-carriers", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u7ec6\u83cc\u6218", "warfare", "\u68c0\u6d4b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9b1888113ff52a9348afd48ed5319be9.png", "infoid": 1000069, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u6709\u6743\u52bf\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6fc0\u52b1\u4ed6\u4eec\u505a\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u597d\u4e8b\uff0c\u4ece\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5f00\u59cb\u3002", "note_en": "These are the world&#39;s most powerful people.

"note_en": "As can be seen on my  LinkedIn,  SecureDNS will shutdown as of 30th of April 2020. Many people have asked me if they could buy SecureDNS, or get my help to build one alike. This technical write-up is for those people. For it to make sense, its best if you checkout my  Github SecureDNS repository as well\n  As front-end loadbalancer/reverse proxy it uses  HaProxy. HaProxy handles the TLS part, and the SNI routing to the correct service.\n  Named/Bind9 by ICS as DNS server. This is the core of the whole infrastructure as it provides all pairing and requests from all other services (including DNS over TLS where Haproxy does the TLS part, and Named the actual resolving)\n DNS over HTTPS server by m13253. It serves DNS over HTTPS, and uses Named as upstream.\n Nginx as webserver for hosting  https://securedns.eu, and test pages like  https://test.securedns.eu and  https://ads-test.securedns.eu that are used to check if users are using SecureDNS as provider.\n Not all components or configured options will be described in detail, as some are straight forward or just best-practice. If you do want to know, check the RFC.\n  HaProxy is a TCP/HTTP loadbalancer with many configurable features. Only disadvantage of this loadbalancer is that it has no support for UDP. This shouldn\u2019t be a problem with DNS over TLS or DNS over HTTPS, though with DNS over QUIC (DoQ) or DNSCrypt it will.\n This loadbalancer is amazing as it has support for SNI routing. The advantage is that you can host multiple services on the same port, and use routing based on the SNI extension in TLS. This ensures for example that one can serve DNS over TLS, DNS over HTTPS, and a webserver on port 443!\n  Below sections contain the content of  haproxy.conf. It is split up in the following sections:\n   global  daemon  user haproxy  group haproxy  maxconn 55000  external-check  tune.ssl.default-dh-param 2048  tune.ssl.cachesize 30000  tune.ssl.lifetime 600  ssl-default-bind-options no-sslv3  nbproc 1  nbthread 4  cpu-map auto:1/1-4 0-3  log /dev/log local0 notice defaults  timeout http-request 10s  timeout queue 30s  timeout check 3s  timeout connect 5000ms  timeout client 30000ms  timeout server 15000ms  balance source  log global\n The  maxconn has been set to 55000 which is above the default to be able to handle more connections. Also  tune.ssl.cachesize and  tune.ssl.lifetime are set to decrease the CPU overhead from TLS handshakes.\n As this server has 4 logical cores, we would like to use multi-threading. Therefore, it has set  nbproc to 1, to ensure 1 master process, and  nbthread to 4 to ensure 4 working threads. Next we assign each thread to 1 logical core by setting  cpu-map to auto:1/1\u20134 0\u20133.\n Next I have used  log to ensure that notice messages are sent to systemd-journal (as journal listens to /dev/log). This is usefull to keep track of online and offline backends.\n As last, I have set the  external-check parameter to enable the feature for using custom health checks to validate if a back-end is online or offline. By default when the parameter  check is used in a back-end, HaProxy will do a TCP handshake to validate if the service is listening on the back-end node. By using this feature, you can use Bash scripts with exit codes for health checks.\n The default section contains all defaults for the front-ends and back-ends. Advantage is that if you add them to default, you only have to add them once, in contrary with noting them in the front or back-end section itself.\n Front-ends The front-end sections are the configuration that are public internet facing, and is where users connect to. These front-ends obviously have a relation to the back-end sections.\n  Port 443/TLS: serves HTTPS for webservers, and DNS over HTTPS (and if you would want to you can also use this for DNS over TLS)\n frontend http  bind :::80 v4v6 tfo  mode http  maxconn 100  redirect scheme https code 301 if !{ ssl_fc }  acl securedns.eu hdr(host) -i securedns.eu  acl test.securedns.eu hdr(host) -i test.securedns.eu  acl ads-test.securedns.eu hdr(host) -i ads-test.securedns.eu  use_backend http-securedns.eu if securedns.eu  use_backend http-test.securedns.eu if test.securedns.eu  use_backend http-ads-test.securedns.eu if ads-test.securedns.eu  default_backend http-securedns.eu frontend https bind  ...\n  tfo: use TCP Fast Open (sets kind of a cookie to enable faster handshake when connecting again)\n crt: set certificate (take note that that 1 file must contain the cert, CA chain, and the private key. So if you are using LetsEncrypt you need to combine these). You can use multiple crt statements on this line to let HaProxy serve multiple certs for different domains.\n We use the  mode parameter to set the front-end to a HTTP or TCP proxy. Keep in mind that if you set it to HTTP, and the traffic is not HTTP, it won\u2019t be routed. Using HTTP has the advantage to make the loadbalancer more aware of the traffic, in which some optimizations can be used for HTTP traffic (e.g. forwarded for headers etc.)\n Next it has the  maxconn set above the default to be able to serve more connections, and we will be configuring  ACL to route traffic based on SNI. It is kind of based on the following conditions:\n   The back-ends are a relationship to the front-ends. Depending on the ACL list, one of the back-ends will be used to proxy the incoming connection to.\n  Port 8081: this hosts the  https://test.securedns.eu website that is used to test if users are using SecureDNS\n Port 8082: this hosts the  https://ads-test.securedns.eu website that is used to test if users are using SecureDNS with Adblocker\n  Port 54: this hosts the DNS server which is used for DNS over TLS with Adblocker\n Port 8053: this hosts the DNS over HTTPS server (which uses port 53 as upstream)\n Port 8054: this hosts the DNS oer HTTPS with Adblocker (which uses port 54 as upstream)\n backend http-securedns.eu  mode http  server nginx 127.0.0.1:8080 check proto h2 source 0.0.0.0:1025-65535 backend http-test.securedns.eu  mode http  server nginx 127.0.0.1:8081 check proto h2 source 0.0.0.0:1025-65535 backend http-ads-test.securedns.eu  mode http  server nginx 127.0.0.1:8082 check proto h2 source 0.0.0.0:1024-65535 backend dns-dot.securedns.eu  mode tcp  server dns0 127.0.0.1:53 check weight 1 source 0.0.0.0:1025-65535 server dns1 10.129.15.242:53 check weight 4 source  ...\n The  server parameter is used to configure a backend node that is able to handle the trafic. Multipe can be configured for loadbalancing purposes. You can use the weight option to configure how much traffic goes to what node. For webservers it has set the option proto h2 to use HTTP/2.\n For some back-ends a custom health check has been configured. This is useful for DNS over HTTPS, as each node is running a DNS over HTTPS server that is dependent on another port/plain DNS Named server. If a default heath check was used, the node would stay online if the plain DNS server is offline, as the DNS over HTTPS server still has an open port/is still listening. The content of the custom health check script set by  external-check command is as following (HaProxy passes  ...\n #!/bin/bash real_ip=$3 /bin/nc -vz $real_ip 53 named=$? /bin/nc -vz $real_ip 8053 doh=$? echo $named echo $doh if [[ $named == 0 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ $named == 0 ]]; then  exit 0 else  exit 1 fi\n The custom health check basically checks if port 8053 (DNS over HTTPS) is listening on the node, and port 53 (DNS Named) on which the DNS over HTTPS server is dependent as upstream.\n  The backend for DNS over TLS is a Named/Bind9 instance. The traffic flow goes directly from HaProxy to the DNS server. Configuration can be seen in later section. It has 2 Named/Bind9 instances; 1 main on port 53, and 1 with Adblocker on port 54.\n  As DNS over HTTPS server it uses a DoH server created by m13253. Traffic flows from HaProxy, to the DNS over HTTPS server, to Named.\n  The configuration is very straight forward. It has 2 instances per node; 1 main, and 1 for Adblocker.\n listen = [  &#34;127.0.0.1:8053&#34;, ] cert = &#34;&#34; key = &#34;&#34; path = &#34;/dns-query&#34; upstream = [  &#34;udp:127.0.0.1:53&#34;, ] timeout = 10 tries = 3 verbose = false\n Listens on port 8053 for main, and port 8054 for Adblocker. For the main it will forward/ upstream to Named on port 53, and for the Adblocker it will forward to Named on port 54.  Cert and  key are left empty as the TLS part is done with HaProxy.\n  As DNS server it uses Named/BIND9 by ISC. I think this is one of the best DNS software as I deem it very stable and customizable. This section will be long and complex due to the many customizations that are done.\n     options {  auth-nxdomain yes;  directory &#34;/usr/local/etc/&#34;;  listen-on { any; };  dnssec-validation auto;  statistics-file &#34;/var/log/named.stats&#34;;  recursion yes;  allow-query { any; };  allow-recursion { any; };  allow-query-cache { any; };  minimal-responses yes;  max-cache-size 3000m;  tcp-clients 1500;  minimal-any true;  response-padding { any; } block-size 468;  qname-minimization relaxed; };\n minimal-response has been set to improve performance. This ensure that the DNS server won\u2019t return any other query types other then NS, A, and AAAA, unless specifically requested.\n max-cache-size has been set as well for optimization. If not set, it can use up to 90% of available memory. As these servers contain multiple services, I have set it manually to ensure some memory for e.g. Named Adblocker, DNS over HTTPS server etc.\n minimal-any has been set to ensure that queries with the type ANY do not return all types, but only NS. This decreases bandwidth, and is just considered best practice.\n response-padding is used as well, to prevent analysis of encrypted downstream packets in correlation with unencrypted upstream queries to the DNS root servers (in regards to packet length). Just best practice as well.\n qname-minimization is set to ensure privacy when querying authoritative DNS servers. Basically this means: if I query a.b.c.d.com, only request NS of 1 subdomain e.g. ask .com for d.com, and ask d.com for c.d.com., and ask c.d.com for b.c.d.com. This prevents leaking the actual request which is a.b.c.d.com.\n Logging Section is to prevent error messages from requests in the logging. It ensures that only critical messages are sent to systemd-journal. Not to special:\n logging {  channel default_syslog {  print-time yes;  print-category yes;  print-severity yes;  syslog daemon;  severity critical;  };  category default { default_syslog; }; };\n Zones and Masters This section contains the zones that are used to let a user know on  https://securedns.eu if they are connected to SecureDNS or not, and the pairing with Emercoin Core and OpenNIC.\n zone &#34;.&#34; {  type hint;  file &#34;/usr/local/etc/named.root&#34;; }; zone &#34;test.securedns.eu&#34; IN {  type master;  file &#34;/usr/local/etc/zone/test.securedns.eu.zone&#34;;  allow-query { any; };  notify no; };\n First zone is the root zone which forwards to the root hints. Second zone is a master authoritative zone for test.securedns.eu. The zone contains 1 A record for test.securedns.eu as well. This means that if you can resolve test.securedns.eu, or be able to reach  https://test.securedns.euhosted by Nginx, you are using SecureDNS (keep in mind that SecureDNS is not the authoritative server for its own securedns.eu domain as this is hosted with Cloudflare. This  ...\n $(document).ready(() =&gt;  $.ajax({type: &#39;HEAD&#39;, url: &#39; https://test.securedns.eu&#39;})  .done(() =&gt; {  const $text = $(&#39;#status&#39;);  $text.html(&#34;You are using SecureDNS! &lt;i class=&#39;fas fa-lock&#39;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#34;);  })  );\n The website  https://securedns.eu actually does a Ajax jQuery HEAD request to  https://test.securedns.eu. If this query is succesful, then it means that you were able to resolve test.securedns.eu as well. This is how SecureDNS is able to check if you are using SecureDNS or not.\n  masters opennicPeers {  185.121.177.177;  2a05:dfc7:5::53; }; masters opennicNS {  161.97.219.84;  2001:470:4212:10:0:100:53:10;  163.172.168.171;  94.103.153.176;  2a02:990:219:1:ba:1337:cafe:3;  207.192.71.13;  178.63.116.152;  2a01:4f8:141:4281::999;  51.77.227.84;  188.226.146.136;  2001:470:1f04:ebf::2;  51.75.173.177;  79.124.7.81;  144.76.103.143;  2a01:4f8:192:43a5::2;  }; zone &#34;dns.opennic.glue&#34; in {  type slave; file &#34;zone/dns.opennic.glue.zone&#34;;  ...\n On top you have the master servers that hold the zones for the OpenNIC TLDs. Then you have the slave zones that actually replicate the full zone locally.\n  zone &#34;emc&#34; in {  type forward;  forward first;  forwarders {  10.129.6.52 port 5335; // Local Emercoin wallet  }; }; zone &#34;coin&#34; in {  type forward;  forward first;  forwarders {  10.129.6.52 port 5335; // Local Emercoin wallet  }; }; zone &#34;lib&#34; in {  type forward;  forward first;  forwarders {  10.129.6.52 port 5335; // Local Emercoin wallet  }; }; zone &#34;bazar&#34; IN {  type forward;  forward first;  forwarders { 10.129.6.52 port  ...\n  As DNSSEC is enabled for Named, you won\u2019t be able to actually resolve these TLDs from Emercoin and OpenNIC as they do not have any RRSIG record. Therefore you have to create a negative trust anchor for these TLDs by using the following:\n   Previous sections are the configuration for the main Named instance. Though it also has a Named instance with an Adblocker. This configuration is the same for the options and logging part, apart from the listening port which is 54 instead of 53 (as can be seen in previous sections as Adblocking services forward to 54).\n Zones and Masters The zones are different though. This instance uses the Named main instance as forwarder.\n zone &#34;.&#34; {  type forward;  forward first;  forwarders {  127.0.0.1 port 53; // Main Bind instance  }; }; zone &#34;test.securedns.eu&#34; IN {  type master;  file &#34;/usr/local/etc/zone/test.securedns.eu.zone&#34;;  allow-query { any; };  notify no; }; zone &#34;ads-test.securedns.eu&#34; IN {  type master;  file &#34;/usr/local/etc/zone/ads-test.securedns.eu.zone&#34;;  allow-query { any; };  notify no; };\n As you can see it also contains an extra zone that hosts the ads-test.securedns domain. This zone file contains again an A record for ads-test.securedns.eu. Same as previously, if you are able to resolve this domain, and therefore be able to browse to  https://ads-test.securedns.eu hosted on Nginx, you are using SecureDNS with Adblocker.\n Then the last part of this configuration is the actual blocking of domains. SecureDNS uses the domain block list from  Notracking. Every night a script runs that iterates over each domain, rewrites it to the syntax below, and ads it to the Named Adblocker configuration file.\n  This zone sets ads-null.zone as authoritative for the domain. This zone file contains a wildcard record that resolves everything to 127.0.0.1 (and therefore it is blocked).\n  It runs the Emercoin Core to get the Blockchain database. So you need to install Emercoin Core and run Emercoind.\n     It uses a DNSCrypt-wrapper to run the DNSCrypt instances. As DNSCrypt uses UDP as well, it cannot use the loadbalancer. This means that this service has no redundancy/failover.\n  Daemon: starts the actual 2 wrapper below, and kill already running wrappers. Does this twice a day to ensure daily key re-roll.\n Wrapper: starts the DNSCrypt instances (1 for IPv4 and 1 for IPv6) and rerolls keys if older than 24 hours, forwards to Named\n  SecureDNS uses LetsEncrypt certificates. These certs expire every 90 days. One could you   certbot  to automatically renew the certificates.\n Keep in mind that if you renew certificates with certbot, it will automatically generate a new public key. As the DNS over TLS standard actually validates the public key, one need to make sure that it stays the same. Therefore, I always renew the certificates manually.\n I won\u2019t go to much into detail as there is enough written on the internet about this, but its basically done by doing the following:\n  I would like to thank everyone for using SecureDNS. Especially the people who donated as they made it possible to keep it up and running for almost 3 years.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:47:56", "tags": "\u5b89\u5168,secure,dns", "title":

"note_en": "As we\u2019ve all been adopting practices like social distancing and remote working, development teams have become more distributed. Our own team has been facing some of the challenges that are part of this transition, and it has motivated us to double down on our priority to  help developers stay productive from anywhere. First, we made remote collaboration easier by enabling users to  join Live Share sessions from their browser. Today, I \u2019m excited to share more news, this time related to Visual Studio  ...\n    In November I had the privilege to  announce the public preview of Visual Studio Online to the world. Over the last few months we\u2019ve had a blast learning from our users and finding ways to improve. One of the most consistent things we\u2019ve heard is that the ability to create cloud-hosted dev environments is having a positive impact in more ways than we had thought. In particular, our users are finding that:\n The time it takes to onboard to new projects (or new tasks within an existing project) is  much shorter\n The performance of their cloud dev environment in many ways feels better than their local environment\n The ability to easily switch between Visual Studio Code, the browser-based editor, or the Visual Studio IDE ( in private preview) gives them the flexibility to work from just about any device\n It\u2019s easy to collaborate with others since  Live Share is built-in for co-authoring, editing, and debugging.\n We learned that developers are finding Visual Studio Online to be much more than just an \u201ceditor in the browser\u201d. They are saying that \u201c the capabilities of this cloud-hosted dev environment make it the space where I want to write all my code\u201c.\n To better align with that sentiment, and the true value of the service, we\u2019re renaming Visual Studio Online to Visual Studio Codespaces. (It\u2019s true what they say, naming is hard! \ud83d\ude09) Do you want a great experience working on your long-term project? Do it in a Codespace. Need to quickly prototype a new feature or perform some short-term tasks (like reviewing pull requests)? Create a Codespace! Your Codespaces are simply the most productive space to code. \ud83c\udf89\n Look for these naming changes to begin appearing in the product in the coming weeks and months.\n  We believe that Visual Studio  Online Codespaces offers the best remote development experience on the market. We want to make sure as many people as possible have access to and use Codespaces, especially given the challenges we all currently face. To make that a reality, we\u2019re lowering our prices over the course of the next week.\n As we always have, we\u2019ll continue to charge only for the time and resources you use (and not one second more!). While you\u2019re active in a Codespace it leverages Azure compute resources. The new pricing for each active Codespace breaks down like this:\n   This is a change that I\u2019m very excited to be able to announce. Full pricing details will be available on  the pricing page and  calculator by Build.\n  Finally, we\u2019re also announcing one new feature today. (Is this my \u201cone more thing\u201d moment!?) While developers love the performance that they are seeing in our cloud-hosted Codespaces, we\u2019ve also learned that there\u2019s lots of scenarios that either don\u2019t require so much power, or where developers want to run multiple smaller Codespaces so that they can flexibly multitask.\n To better enable those scenarios, as well as to help people transitioning to remote development for the first time, we\u2019re introducing a Basic instance type that comes with two virtual cores, four GB RAM, and 64 GB of SSD storage. We did a lot of testing with this configuration, and the experience is just as great as it is on our Standard and Premium instance types \u2013 but at a lower cost. Basic instance types are available right now.\n Here\u2019s the above pricing table repeated with the Basic instance type added in:\n    I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t also take this opportunity to let you know that in the past few months we\u2019ve added some other great features to the service! My personal favorite is  our support for bring-your-own Dockerfiles or images. With this feature, a Codespace can be tailored to your exact specifications, either by pointing at an image from a registry like Docker Hub, or by placing a custom Dockerfile in your repository, which Visual Studio Codespaces will run and connect you to.\n We also recently shipped a small but mighty feature that lets users change the instance size of their environments. This means that you can spend the majority of your time in a lower powered, lower cost environment and then \u201cupgrade the horsepower\u201d only if and when you need to \u2013 without losing state or having to create a new environment. To top it off, the Basic instance type also supports this, so you can play Goldilocks and find the instance type that\u2019s just right for you. \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffc \ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc3b\n The last recent addition that I\u2019m excited about is the massive improvement we\u2019ve made to our self-hosted environment capabilities. With self-hosted environments you can register any machine to Visual Studio Codespaces and connect to it from either VS Code or our browser-based editor. Best of all, this is 100% free! My colleague Allison  announced all the details \u2013 be sure to check out her post for more info.\n  Between our lowered pricing, spiffy new name, the Basic instance type, and all the other features the team has been shipping, there\u2019s never been a better time to try remote development with Visual Studio Codespaces.  Go give it a try and let us know what you think in the comments.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:47:50", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u4ee3\u7801,studio,\u529f\u80fd", "title": "Visual

"note_en": "10 things you need to know today   Today&#39;s best articles   Today&#39;s top cartoons   The good news newsletter   The week&#39;s best photojournalism   Daily business briefing   Daily gossip newsletter   Parenting newsletter   Solving COVID newsletter\n               When you examine the lives of history&#39;s most creative figures, you are immediately confronted with a paradox: They organized their lives around their work, but not their days.\n   Figures as different as Charles Dickens, Henri Poincar\u00e9, and Ingmar Bergman, working in disparate fields in different times, all shared a passion for their work, a terrific ambition to succeed, and an almost superhuman capacity to focus. Yet when you look closely at their daily lives, they only spent a few hours a day doing what we would recognize as their most important work. The rest of the time, they were hiking mountains, taking naps, going on walks with friends, or just  ...\n How did they manage to be so accomplished? If some of history&#39;s greatest figures didn&#39;t put in immensely long hours, maybe the key to unlocking the secret of their creativity lies in understanding not just how they labored but how they rested.\n After his morning walk and breakfast, Charles Darwin was in his study by 8 a.m. and worked a steady hour and a half. At 9:30 he would read the morning mail and write letters. At 10:30, Darwin returned to more serious work, sometimes moving to his aviary or greenhouse to conduct experiments. By noon, he would declare, &#34;I&#39;ve done a good day&#39;s work,&#34; and set out on a long walk. When he returned after an hour or more, Darwin had lunch and answered more letters.  ...\n On this schedule he wrote 19 books, including technical volumes on climbing plants, barnacles, and other subjects; the controversial  Descent of Man; and  The Origin of Species, probably the single most famous book in the history of science.\n  But at the same time, his days don&#39;t seem very busy to us. If he had been a university professor today, he would have been denied tenure. If he&#39;d been working in a company, he would have been fired within a week.\n It&#39;s not that Darwin was careless or lacked ambition. He was intensely conscious of time and, despite being a gentleman of means, felt that he had none to waste.\n But he managed something that seems increasingly alien today. His life was full and memorable, his work was prodigious, and yet his days were filled with downtime.\n  Darwin is not the only famous scientist who combined a lifelong dedication to science with apparently short working hours. We can see similar patterns in many others&#39; careers, and it&#39;s worth starting with the lives of scientists for several reasons. Science is a competitive, all-consuming enterprise. Scientists&#39; accomplishments \u2014the number of articles and books they write, the awards they win, the rate at which their works are cited \u2014are well-documented and  ...\n One example is Poincar\u00e9, the French mathematician whose public eminence and accomplishments placed him on a level similar to Darwin&#39;s. Poincar\u00e9&#39;s 30 books and 500 papers spanned number theory, topology, astronomy and celestial mechanics, theoretical and applied physics, and philosophy; he was involved in efforts to standardize time zones, supervised railway development in northern France, and was a professor at the Sorbonne.\n Poincar\u00e9 wasn&#39;t just famous among his fellow scientists: In 1895 he was, along with the novelist \u00c9mile Zola, sculptors Auguste Rodin and Jules Dalou, and composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, the subject of a study by French psychiatrist \u00c9douard Toulouse on the psychology of genius. Toulouse noted that Poincar\u00e9 kept very regular hours. He did his hardest thinking between 10 a.m. and noon, and again between 5 and 7 in the afternoon. The 19th century&#39;s most towering  ...\n We see the same pattern among other noted mathematicians. G.H. Hardy, one of Britain&#39;s leading mathematicians in the first half of the 20th century, would start his day with a leisurely breakfast and close reading of the cricket scores, then from 9 to 1 would be immersed in mathematics. After lunch he would be out again, walking and playing tennis. &#34;Four hours&#39; creative work a day is about the limit for a mathematician,&#34; he told his friend and fellow  ...\n  A survey of scientists&#39; working lives conducted in the early 1950s yielded results in a similar range. Illinois Institute of Technology psychology professors Raymond Van Zelst and Willard Kerr surveyed their colleagues about their work habits and schedules, then graphed the number of hours spent in the office against the number of articles they produced. You might expect that the result would be a straight line showing that the more hours scientists worked, the  ...\n The data revealed an M-shaped curve. The curve rose steeply at first and peaked at between 10 to 20 hours per week. The curve then turned downward. Scientists who spent 25 hours in the workplace were no more productive than those who spent five. Scientists working 35 hours a week were half as productive as their 20-hours-a-week colleagues.\n From there, the curve rose again, but more modestly. Researchers who buckled down and spent 50 hours per week in the lab were able to pull themselves out of the 35-hour valley: They became as productive as colleagues who spent five hours a week in the lab. Van Zelst and Kerr speculated that this 50-hour bump was concentrated in &#34;physical research,&#34; and that most of those 10-hour days were spent tending machines and occasionally taking measurements.\n After that, it was all downhill: The 60-plus-hour-a-week researchers were the least productive of all.\n  Karl Anders Ericsson, Ralf Krampe, and Clemens Tesch-R\u00f6mer saw a similar pattern in a study of violin students at a conservatory in Berlin in the 1980s. Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-R\u00f6mer were interested in what sets outstanding students apart from merely good ones. After interviewing music students and their teachers and having students keep track of their time, they found that several things separated the best students from the rest.\n First, the great students didn&#39;t just practice more than the average, they practiced more deliberately. During deliberate practice, Ericsson explained, you&#39;re &#34;engaging with full concentration in a special activity to improve [your] performance.&#34; You&#39;re not just doing reps, lobbing balls, or playing scales. Deliberate practice is focused, structured, and offers clear goals and feedback; it requires paying attention to what you&#39;re doing  ...\n Second, you need a reason to keep at it, day after day. Deliberate practice isn&#39;t a lot of fun, and it&#39;s not immediately profitable. It means being in the pool before sunrise, working on your swing or stride when you could be hanging out with friends, spending hours perfecting details that only a few other people will ever notice. There&#39;s little that&#39;s inherently or immediately pleasurable in deliberate practice, so you need a strong sense that  ...\n  Ericsson&#39;s study is a foundation for Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s argument (laid out most fully in his book  Outliers) that 10,000 hours of practice are necessary to become world-class in anything, and that everyone from chess legend Bobby Fischer to Microsoft founder Bill Gates to the Beatles put in their 10,000 hours before anyone heard of them. For coaches, music teachers, and ambitious parents, the number promises a golden road to the NFL or Juilliard or  ...\n But there was something else that Ericsson and his colleagues noted in their study, something that almost everyone has overlooked. &#34;Deliberate practice,&#34; they observed, &#34;is an effortful activity that can be sustained only for a limited time each day.&#34; Practice too little and you never become world-class. Practice too much, though, and you increase the odds of being struck down by injury, draining yourself mentally, or burning out.\n How do students marked for greatness make the most of limited practice time? The rhythm of their practice follows a distinctive pattern. They put in more hours per week, but they don&#39;t do it by making each practice longer. Instead, they have more frequent, shorter sessions, each lasting about 80 to 90 minutes, with half-hour breaks in between.\n Add these several practices up, and what do you get? About four hours a day. About the same amount of time Darwin spent every day doing his hardest work and Hardy and Littlewood spent doing math.\n This upper limit, Ericsson concluded, is defined &#34;not by available time, but by available [mental and physical] resources for effortful practice.&#34; The students weren&#39;t just practicing four hours and calling it a day; lectures, rehearsals, homework, and other things kept them busy the rest of the day. In interviews, the students said &#34;it was primarily their ability to sustain the concentration necessary for deliberate practice that limited  ...\n Ericsson and his colleagues observed another thing, in addition to practicing more, that separated the great students at the Berlin conservatory from the good, something that has been almost completely ignored since: how they rested.\n The top performers actually slept about an hour a day more than the average performers. They didn&#39;t sleep late. They got more sleep because they napped during the day. Of course there was lots of variability, but the best students generally followed a pattern of practicing hardest and longest in the morning, taking a nap in the afternoon, and then having a second practice in the late afternoon or evening.\n For all the attention the Berlin conservatory study has received, this part of the top students&#39; experiences \u2014 their sleep patterns, their attention to leisure, their cultivation of deliberate rest as a necessary complement of demanding, deliberate practice \u2014 goes unmentioned. In  Outliers, Gladwell focuses on the number of hours exceptional performers practice and says nothing about the fact that those students also slept an hour more, on average,  ...\n This is not to say that Gladwell misread Ericsson&#39;s study; he just glossed over that part. And he has lots of company. Everybody speed-reads through the discussion of sleep and leisure and argues about the 10,000 hours.\n This illustrates a blind spot that scientists, scholars, and almost all of us share: a tendency to fixate on focused work, to assume that the road to greater creativity is paved by life hacks, propped up by eccentric habits, or smoothed by Adderall or LSD. Those who research world-class performance look only at what students do in the gym or practice room. Everybody concentrates on the most obvious, measurable forms of work and tries to make those  ...\n This is how we&#39;ve come to believe that world-class performance comes after 10,000 hours of practice. But that&#39;s wrong. It comes after 10,000 hours of deliberate practice, 12,500 hours of deliberate rest, and 30,000 hours of sleep.\n Adapted excerpt from   Rest:  Why You Get More Done When You Work Less  by Alex Soojung-Kim Pang.

"note_en": "Amorphous, open-ended, unstructured time, with undercurrents of foreboding, pockets of boredom and fleeting interludes of peace or reassessment. That\u2019s what Covid-19 has brought to many people \u2014 and it\u2019s a mental state that Brian Eno\u2019s vast recorded catalog has been prepared for since he first popularized the term \u201cambient music\u201d in the 1970s. The long days and featureless nights of self-quarantine offer an opportune moment to revisit \u2014 or get acquainted with \u2014 Eno\u2019s time-warping music.\n He does have other skills. On four solo albums from the 1970s, after he left Roxy Music, Eno thoroughly mastered rock-song structure, with slyly cerebral lyrics and skewed instrumental sounds; all four albums are gems, particularly \u201cBefore and After Science\u201d from 1977. He has intermittently made song albums in the decades since. And his 1981 collaboration with David Byrne on \u201cMy Life in the Bush of Ghosts\u201d \u2014 shaping found-sound sampled vocals from international sources into  rhythm-driven, club-ready  ...\n But for the most part, Eno has channeled his pop impulses into production and collaborations \u2014 with U2, David Bowie, Talking Heads, John Cale and lately Karl Hyde of Underworld. Yet the bulk of his own recordings, and all of those selected here, are instrumentals that, old or new, are particularly suited to orchestrate this uneasy historical moment.\n Eno was not the first to make music designed to maintain a subliminal, atmospheric presence while evading the foreground. By his account, medical circumstance led him to thinking about music as just one element in a larger environment. When he was immobilized after an automobile accident, a friend left music playing on a record player he couldn \u2019t reach, at such low volume that it melded with all the other sounds in the room; Eno being Eno, he ended up listening with John Cage-like attentiveness.  ...\n Yet Eno himself has continued to rework what ambient music might mean with continual flexibility, shifting his approaches and adapting constantly to new technology and circumstances. He has released multiple albums per year throughout a four-decade solo career \u2014including, this year, \u201cMixing Colours, \u201da collaboration with his brother Roger Eno. There are clearly sounds he is drawn to repeatedly: glimmering reverberant timbres, uncannily sustained chords and clusters, melodic phrases that shy away  ...\n Eno has improvised in the studio, alone or with collaborators, using real time recordings or making surreal edits. He has composed extremely short ambient works \u2014 like the six-second  Windows 95 start-up sound\u2014and potentially endless ones. He has made music that seems cyclical and music that hints at narrative. For decades, he has created generative music: systems that are set in motion, like loops of irregular length or permutations of computer-generated tones, and chosen particular results  ...\n Here are some of Eno\u2019s best ambient works \u2014 long tracks, often, that might provide half-heard diversion through a sleepless night. ( Listen to the full playlist on Spotify, too.)\n   Eno and Robert Fripp (King Crimson \u2019s guitarist) experimented in the early 1970s with looping \u2014which, back in the analog era, involved routing a tape through two tape recorders, to layer the recording from the first one with the playback from the second. The loop sets up a pulsating drone in \u201cThe Heavenly Music Corporation 1, \u201dtopped by lead-guitar solos from Fripp that claw and flail, then braid themselves back into the drone: aggression patiently reframed. (Note: Although streaming services  ...\n   The title track of Eno\u2019s first solo ambient breakthrough loops and undulates for just over half an hour, with endlessly recurring, somehow optimistic two-note and four-note motifs that float in an amniotic bath of consonances. The reedy electronic tones suggest woodwinds played by musicians who never have to pause for breath.\n    Eno officially claimed the term \u201cambient \u201dwith \u201cAmbient 1/Music for Airports, \u201dan LP of four tracks that showed diagrams of how their loops intersected on the album cover. Its opening track, functionally titled \u201c1/1 \u201dand credited to Eno, Robert Wyatt (who played the piano) and Rhett Davies, could have been complete in its first 20 seconds: a piano phrase answered by its tonic chord, all neatly resolved. But after a pause, the phrase recurs and extends, joined by other motifs and consoling  ...\n   For \u201cAmbient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror,\u201d Harold Budd improvised on pianos that Eno had treated with electronics: altering their tone, bringing out certain resonances, triggering synthesizers. In \u201cThe Chill Air,\u201d the treatments are faint afterimages and anticipations, subtly revealing themselves as Budd plays measured counterpoint, mostly just two notes at a time, tiptoeing with a purpose.\n   On his 1982 album, \u201cAmbient 4: On Land,\u201d Eno evoked landscapes by incorporating natural sounds, placing the music outside the studio. \u201cThe Lost Day\u201d hints at gusty winds and the clanging of distant bell buoys, guidance through a treacherous harbor; dramatic cello-like lines arise and drift away, as if swallowed up by a haze.\n   Much of \u201cApollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks\u201d is as sparse as an airless lunar vista. \u201cAn Ending (Ascent)\u201d is lush by comparison: slow, breathy-toned, slightly blurred major-key chords that suggest a miniaturized processional, a ritual happening in reduced gravity.\n   Inescapable foreboding and disquiet run all the way through \u201cThe Shutov Assembly, \u201dfrom 1992, which may well be Eno \u2019s bleakest, most dissonant album. \u201cLanzarote \u201ddraws suspense from what might seem, in prospect, to radiate stability. For much of its length, a single note arrives in assorted keyboard tones in different octaves, low and high, from tolling bass to solitary piano to distant cricket-like overtones to hints of organ and orchestra. But other sustained notes waft in to dispute  ...\n   The 57-minute \u201cNeroli\u201d is an exercise in austerity: a fixed bass note tolling irregularly behind a lugubrious keyboard line that stops and starts, wandering fitfully within a small, circumscribed range and in a vaguely Asian-sounding mode. Deep in the background, other sustained tones loom. Eno subtitled it \u201cMusic for Thinking IV,\u201d suggesting that it wouldn\u2019t be distracting; it\u2019s monolithically reticent.\n   Eno wrote music for a film about the filmmaker Derek Jarman and decided the tracks weren \u2019t strong enough on their own for a soundtrack album. So he sent them to Jah Wobble, the bassist from Public Image Ltd., who reworked them by himself in a hands-off collaboration. \u201cTransmitter and Trumpet \u201dsprouts a brisk six-beat bass line that appears and disappears and beams in a world of influences: orchestras, electronics, Morocco, India, West Africa. And then it obscures them in echoes, static  ...\n   Eno made \u201cSmall Craft on a Milk Sea\u201d with Jon Hopkins, a dance-music D.J.-producer, and Leo Abrahams, who plays guitar and other instruments; the album mixed song-length, melodic tracks with far more abstract ones like \u201cCalcium Needles.\u201d The track courts vertigo, following descending bell tones into a bottomless, reverberating abyss.\n   The album \u201cFinding Shore \u201dis a collaboration with the keyboardist Tom Rogerson, from the band Three Trapped Tigers. Rogerson improvised on piano; Eno manipulated the sounds as Rogerson played and responded. The piano sounds more or less natural through much of the album, but on \u201cMarsh Chorus, \u201dEno transforms its tone into a hybrid of harpsichord and carillon and turns some notes into insistently pinging loops. Rogerson plays decisive, declamatory phrases and lets things shimmer in  ...\n   Near-stillness prevails through most of the hourlong \u201cReflection, \u201dalong with stereo-ricocheting tones that live up to the piece \u2019s title. It \u2019s a generative piece, with one form including an iOS app, so the streaming and CD versions of \u201cReflections \u201dare only a few of its countless shapes. Its materials are bell tones, endlessly sustained string-like and clarinet-like notes, a shivery undercurrent and elusive, flitting pockets of echo. Although it is generated via software with  ...\n   Eno \u2019s six-CD collection of \u201cMusic for Installations \u201dgathered music he has written for site-specific works since the 1980s; it includes \u201cSurbahar Sleeping Music \u201damong its \u201cmusic for future installations. \u201dA surbahar is larger, lower-pitched relative of the sitar, and this 18-minute drone piece, with no fixed beat or pulse, sounds like it \u2019s constructed from notes plucked on the surbahar, on their own and electronically manipulated, richly radiating upward from deep, plangent  ...\n   It was probably inevitable that Eno would eventually collaborate with Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine, a fellow wielder of edgeless, untraceable, overwhelming sounds. \u201cOnly Once Away My Son \u201dis the instrumental half of a 2018 single \u2014its lyrics appear in the other track, \u201cThe Weight of History \u201d\u2014and it \u2019s a speaker-challenging tempest of drone and distortion, lingering to reveal sustained turbulence at every level, overloading even more and then somehow solidifying into a  ...\n   Eno\u2019s latest collaboration with a keyboardist is \u201cMixing Colours,\u201d an album made with his younger brother, Roger, whose own music tends to be prettier and more straightforwardly melodic than Brian Eno\u2019s work. \u201cBurnt Umber\u201d is a melancholy waltz, a melody unfolding in slightly cracked bell tones over a somber four-note bass vamp, calmly disconsolate.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:47:42", "tags":

"note_en": "A vitamin commonly produced by sun-exposed skin cells might play a role in preventing death by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, according to new research.\n Preliminary results from a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed study carried out by scientists from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Foundation Trust and the University of East Anglia have linked low levels of the hormone vitamin D with COVID-19 mortality rates across Europe.\n   It&#39;s a study that certainly deserves some attention as a potential piece of the coronavirus puzzle, reminding us that health and disease can be a complex affair involving a variety of lifestyle factors.\n But it&#39;s also important to interpret evidence like this as part of a bigger scientific conversation, meaning it would be premature to make any recommendations and  certainly way too premature to hit the supplement aisle before further evidence arrives.\n The researchers dug through existing health literature to catalogue the average levels of vitamin D among the citizens of 20 European countries, and then compared the figures with the relative numbers of COVID-19 deaths in each country.\n A simple statistical test showed there was a pretty convincing correlation between the figures, where populations with lower than average concentrations of the vitamin also featured more deaths from SARS-CoV-2.\n &#34;The most vulnerable group of population for COVID-19 is also the one that has the most deficit in vitamin D,&#34; the researchers conclude in their  preliminary report.\n Cross-sectional reports like these aren&#39;t without their problems, doing little more than suggesting some kind of relationship might exist. People who tend to have higher vitamin D levels in their body might be doing something else that helps limit destruction caused by the virus, for example.\n   But the results aren&#39;t surprising either, falling in line with  previous, more  robust studies that also suggest healthy vitamin D levels can reduce the risk of respiratory infections such as influenza and  tuberculosis, as well as childhood asthma.\n Vitamin D is a fat-soluble compound we can either get as a nutrient from foods like mushrooms or fish, or produced in our skin when a form of cholesterol reacts to UV light.\n Commonly known for its role in maintaining calcium levels in our bones, deficiency in this vitamin is responsible for skeletal deformities  such as rickets as well as an increased risk of bone degeneration behind conditions such as  osteoporosis.\n Researchers are gradually piecing together the vitamin&#39;s functions in the immune system as well, noting its relationship with  autoimmune conditions and the discovery of receptors for the chemical on  various immune cells.\n Just how it might combat coronavirus infections \u2013 if at all \u2013 is sure to be a popular subject in future studies.\n Meanwhile, as uncontroversial as the results might be, a single study ahead of peer review shouldn&#39;t be the basis for medical advice. Science just doesn&#39;t support making the leap between reading about healthy amounts of vitamin D in the blood and popping a supplement.\n   In 2017, medical researchers Mark J Bolland from the University of Auckland in New Zealand and Alison Avenell from the University of Aberdeen in the UK  argued the need for caution over how we interpret studies not unlike this one.\n &#34;Vitamin D supplementation is a hot topic, provoking passionate arguments for and against widespread supplementation,&#34; they  write in an editorial on the diverse array of  studies on the subject in the past decade.\n Results might look positive, but there&#39;s just no way to turn a jumble of statistics into precise recommendations that can be tailored for individual needs. Even the  World Health Organisation is tentative about using past research as the basis of specific recommendations.\n &#34;We think that they should be viewed as hypothesis generating only, requiring confirmation in well-designed, adequately powered randomised controlled trials,&#34;  Bolland and Avenell write.\n Research that speculates a single, commonly available vitamin might make the difference between life and death can seem like a potential life raft in choppy waters, but we need more research to tell us just how and why these patterns exist for us to balance the  risks that come with vitamin supplements.\n In the midst of a pandemic that has the potential to claim thousands of lives around the world every week, science feels painstakingly slow. But it&#39;s always worth the wait.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:47:32", "tags": "\u7ef4\u751f\u7d20,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u6b7b\u4ea1,linked", "title": "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4e0e\u7ef4\u751f\u7d20D\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u5173\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u5b83\u7684\u610f\u601d", "title_en": "Covid-19 Deaths Are Being Linked to Vitamin D Deficiency.

"note_en": "Certain patent owners just can\u2019t get enough of the monopoly power patents bestow. That\u2019s why they keep trying to make it easier to get and sue over patents, despite Supreme Court rulings that point in the opposite direction.\n Their latest effort, the misleadingly-named \u201cInventors Rights Act,\u201d also known as  H.R. 5478, hijacks the positive associations many of us have with \u201cinventors\u201d to radically tilt the patent system in favor of patent owners, including patent trolls.\n Patent trolls make money by threatening people over everyday activities, not by inventing, building, or selling anything of value. At EFF, we\u2019ve been tracking and fighting them  for  years. Over the past two decades, the Patent Office has allowed tens of thousands of vaguely-worded software patents to proliferate. Patent trolls can use those patents for up to twenty years to sue regular people who use software for everyday activities \u2014like making a picture menu, running an online contest,  ...\n Advocates for more patent powers insist\u2014despite nearly two decades of litigation records, studies, and other published evidence\u2014that patent trolls are an overblown problem. We\u00a0published a deep dive on this issue earlier today, discussing  what we mean at EFF when we talk about patent trolls and abuses of the patent system.\n H.R. 5478 will give enormous new litigation powers to a select group of patent owners, which will include many patent trolls. The bill will re-classify them as \u201cinventors\u201d and then grant them new powers. In particular, the bill will throw out the checks against extreme and extortionate patent litigation that have been put in place over the years by the Supreme Court.\n  The Inventors Rights Act would roll back three major areas of law that keep the patent system balanced. The bill pays lip service to \u201cinventors,\u201d but the changes it proposes are seriously harmful\u2014whether they\u2019re limited to certain types of entities or not. Practically speaking, these giveaways will go to dozens, or possibly even hundreds, of litigation-prone limited liability companies, not hardworking individuals.\n First, H.R. 5478 would go back to a system of near-automatic injunctions for patent cases. That would give patent owners the power to shut down other companies \u2019operations (or threaten to do so) regardless of the harm that might cause the public. This change would essentially undo the 2006 landmark patent case, eBay v. MercExchange. That \u2019s the case where the Supreme Court said that patent owners have to prove an injunction is necessary to avoid irreparable harm before they can get  ...\n Second, H.R. 5478 would undo  critical venue reform based on a Supreme Court decision in  TC Heartland. Before  TC Heartland, patent trolls could sue anybody just about anywhere they wanted\u2014and  they often chose the Eastern District of Texas. After TC Heartland, patent owners can only sue defendants where they are incorporated or where they have committed supposedly infringing acts and have a regular and established place of business. This bill \u2019s proponents want to go back to the worst  ...\n Third, H.R. 5478 puts a stop to a critical patent review process called inter partes review, or IPR. The IPR process was created by Congress in 2012 and has been successful in getting the patent office to overturn more than 1,500 wrongly granted patents. We know how important the IPR process is:  EFF used it to challenge the so-called \u201cpodcasting\u201d patentowned by Personal Audio LLC, which was using to harass and threaten podcasters.
