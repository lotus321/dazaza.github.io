Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators, including FAS Dean Claudine Gay.  By  Ryan N. Gajarawala\n     Harvard\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Sciences placed Mathematics and Biology professor Martin A. Nowak on paid administrative leave Friday after a review into Harvard\u2019s ties to Jeffrey E. Epstein found extensive and previously unreported contact between the professor and the convicted sex offender, FAS Dean Claudine Gay wrote in an email to affiliates Friday afternoon.\n A University report found Epstein attempted to use Harvard and the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, which Nowak directs, as a tool to rehabilitate his image following his 2008 conviction for solicitation of minors for prostitution. Epstein likely made more than 40 visits to PED \u2019s offices at One Brattle Square between 2010 and 2018, according to the report, which also states that Nowak approved the posting of flattering and false descriptions of Epstein \u2019s philanthropy and support of Harvard  ...\n University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced in a separate message Friday that the Office of General Counsel and outside law firm Foley Hoag have completed their review into Epstein\u2019s connections to Harvard.\n The review found that no donations were made by Epstein following a decision by former University President Drew G. Faust to refuse donations from Epstein after his conviction.\n Gay wrote in her email that the FAS \u201cfully supports\u201d the recommendations of the General Counsel\u2019s report. The report raises several questions about violations of FAS policies, which Gay wrote in her email will be investigated.\n \u201cThe actions taken by the head of PED, Professor Martin Nowak, as described in the report warrant review to determine whether FAS policies and standards of professional conduct were violated and if additional steps must be taken,\u201d Gay wrote. \u201cTo that end, Professor Nowak has been placed on paid administrative leave.\u201d\n \u201cWe do not take this step lightly, but the seriousness of the matter leads us to believe it is not appropriate for Professor Nowak to continue in his role, other than what he will be asked to do to complete the semester, while the FAS determines its response to the findings of the report,\u201d Gay added.\n  The Crimson reported in 2006 that Epstein donated $6.5 million to the program in 2003, which Friday\u2019s report concluded was by far the largest single donation Epstein made to Harvard. The report found no additional donations to PED after Epstein\u2019s conviction and Faust\u2019s subsequent decision to bar donations from him.\n  In 2005, professor Stephen M. Kosslyn, now emeritus, named Epstein a visiting fellow in the Psychology department, Bacow wrote in an email  announcing the review last September. According to Friday\u2019s report, Epstein \u2014 who did not hold an undergraduate degree \u2014 was not qualified for the research he applied to conduct, nor did he conduct much of that research during his two-year appointment.\n An administrator in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences had recommended that GSAS not admit Epstein as a Visiting Fellow, but his application was approved anyway, per the report.\n  PED also provided Epstein with an office and keycode access to its building, which he maintained even after he vacated his visiting fellowship. The report found no evidence that Epstein interacted with Harvard students during his approximately 40 visits, though he did attend one of Nowak\u2019s undergraduate math classes.\n Even though Epstein did not donate to PED or Harvard after 2007, he played an \u201cindirect but significant role\u201d in facilitating a grant from the John Templeton Foundation to PED in 2015.\n Epstein died in prison last August, facing federal charges that he trafficked and sexually assaulted underage girls. The Miami Herald reported in November 2018 that Epstein operated a sex ring out of his Palm Beach, Fla. home and identified around 80 women who say Epstein molested or sexually abused them before 2006.\n \u2014Staff writer James S.

"note_en": "A head of procurement for the  NHS has set up a business to profit from the private sale of huge quantities of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, an undercover investigation by the Guardian can reveal.\n David Singleton, 42, a senior NHS official in London who has been working at the capital\u2019s Covid-19 Nightingale hospital, launched the business two weeks ago to trade in visors, masks and gowns.\n Asked about the findings of the investigation, Singleton said he disclosed his business to superiors in the NHS, in accordance with the rules, and was told there was \u201cunlikely to be a conflict\u201d.\n However, the NHS launched an immediate investigation. \u201cWe take any potential conflicts of interest extremely seriously and as soon we became aware of these allegations an internal investigation was started,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n A website for Singleton\u2019s company, Sure Stock, which marketed PPE to private sector and NHS clients, made no reference to Singleton or his role in the health service. But in a phone call with an undercover reporter posing as a potential client, Singleton confirmed he was running the business. He said he was trading as a \u201csales agent\u201d between suppliers and buyers of PPE.\n  According to Singleton\u2019s LinkedIn profile, which he deleted shortly after the Guardian told him about its investigation, he is a head of procurement for the NHS in London. He works within a large commissioning support unit (CSU) that covers the capital\u2019s north and east and surrounding areas. It is understood the investigation is being conducted by his employer, the NHS north and east London CSU.\n During the conversation with the undercover reporter, Singleton said he was \u201ccurrently an NHS employee\u201d but said his role did not involve buying \u201cany products\u201d. \u201cI deliver services,\u201d he said. \u201cSo none of the suppliers that I\u2019m working with do I have any interactions with during my day job.\u201d\n Asked later whether he was exploiting his NHS expertise and contacts, Singleton said in a statement that he was not \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in responding to  the PPE shortage in the NHS \u201cas my role does not involve purchasing or procuring of these products\u201d.\n However, information collated by the Guardian, including internal NHS email evidence, suggests Singleton may have been involved in procuring PPE supplies. Asked to respond to a request for comment about the email evidence, Singleton replied \u201cno comment\u201d and hung up the phone. The NHS declined to comment on the email evidence.\n  Singleton created his PPE company on 15 April, as the shortage of protective equipment for NHS and other health and care workers working on the frontline of the coronavirus outbreak was reaching crisis point.\n His company, Sure Stock Limited, originally registered to Singleton\u2019s home in Essex, launched a website that same week, marketing PPE products for \u201cmedical, dental, adult social care, the food industry and personal use\u201d.\n The website offered large amounts of PPE and hygiene products for sale, including protective face shields, or \u201csmart visors\u201d, which were priced at \u00a319,500 for minimum orders of 10,000 units.\n  Posing as an agent for a meat processing factory, a Guardian reporter approached Sure Stock claiming his client urgently needed large quantities of PPE to protect about 800 workers and return the facility to full production.\n Sure Stock\u2019s salesperson, a friend and associate of Singleton, confirmed the company had been created by Singleton and said he could help source batches of 20,000 visors, masks, gowns and gloves \u2013 as well as 1,000 litres of hand sanitiser \u2013 as part of an initial order. The sale would have totalled more than \u00a3100,000.\n The salesperson told the undercover reporter: \u201cEssentially a friend of mine is head of procurement for NHS London. He has really struggled to get stuff to people in the right timeframe. So essentially what we decided to do was set up a little company and become sales agents for people in the UK who have got stock. And then essentially we would help in linking up the supply chains that are massively disastrous at the moment.\u201d\n The undercover reporter then asked to talk to Singleton directly. During a 40-minute telephone conversation, Singleton told the undercover reporter: \u201cWhat we do is we work with the supplier and then our margin, our commission, our referral, comes from them before the prices go out. So we just work as a sales agent.\u201d\n He also disclosed he was an NHS employee. \u201cWe want to nurture relationships like yours. Because people like you can open doors for some of my suppliers into areas that they don\u2019t currently reach into,\u201d he told the undercover reporter. \u201cSo it\u2019s growing a network of trusted suppliers and buyers because you can\u2019t be a supplier unless you\u2019ve got a buyer. You can\u2019t be a buyer unless you\u2019ve got a supplier. You need to have these things. You need to connect up.\u201d\n  Towards the end of the call, Singleton emphasised how competitive his visor prices were and encouraged the undercover reporter to \u201cpiggyback\u201d a large order \u201ccurrently \u2026 going through with the Far East [and a UK importer]\u201d. He added: \u201cWhat I\u2019d close off by saying is when you are in a position where you know you want to place an order, rest assured that you are going to be dealing with a UK company.\u201d\n Singleton told the undercover reporter that during the Covid-19 outbreak he had been \u201credeployed\u201d to the Nightingale hospital at the Excel Centre and the Royal London hospital and was \u201chelping them set up their pop-up ITU [intensive treatment unit] wards and their stock rooms\u201d.\n In his statement to the Guardian following the undercover investigation, Singleton said he had not set up ITUs or stock rooms and had not been involved in any procurement at the the hospital.\n He said he had notified his employer about Sure Stock, as is required, and had been informed by a superior that \u201cthere is unlikely to be a conflict\u201d, as it was perceived there would be no crossover in terms of customers. Singleton said declaring the directorship was the main step towards compliance and this had been completed.\n However, the Guardian understands that while Singleton recently declared his new business via an internal online NHS reporting system, the disclosure was under review and had not yet been approved.\n In his conversation with the undercover reporter, Singleton\u2019s salesperson appeared to give conflicting accounts of whether or not the firm planned to market to the NHS. At one point he said: \u201cWe\u2019re not really wanting to approach anyone in the NHS, because there is a bit of conflict of interest, so we are sort of staying out of that.\u201d\n But during another part of the conversation, about the scarcity of gowns on the market, the salesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of NHS trusts frantically phoning around trying to get hold of these and they can\u2019t.\u201d He added: \u201cNow what we are doing with those, we are offering the NHS 30 days to pay.\u201d\n  In his emailed statement, Singleton said Sure Stock \u201chas not and will not sell PPE and related equipment to the NHS, or any NHS organisation\u201d. He added: \u201cAny such allegation is false\u201d.\n However, a photograph on Sure Stock\u2019s website advertising face shields showed a visor with the NHS logo printed on the front, and the company offered deals for NHS clients. \u201cFor our NHS heroes your price is fixed!\u201d the website stated.\n In his statement, Singleton said the face shields have not been sold to the NHS because they did not meet the complex medical devices regulations which govern the manufacture and supply of such products.\n Sure Stock\u2019s website was mothballed shortly after Singleton was contacted by the Guardian for comment. It now just states: \u201c Coming soon\u201d.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:55:33", "tags": "\u91c7\u8d2d,procurement,nhs", "title":

"note_en": "Recently I got bored of wrinting frontend at work every day. I\u2019ve decided to try some lower level stuff.I\u2019ve heard a lot of people talking about this new great architecture called RISC-V and I\u2019ve always liked low level stuff, so I\u2019ve decided to play around with it.\n As the name suggests RISC-V is a risc architecture, It only has a few instructions and is designed to be extensible. You can do everything with the base implementation but since it\u2019s so limited, most implementation use extensions to add additional functionality(like integer multiplication). The list of extensions can be found  here. This makes the ISA really simple to implement and to implement software for it.\n In this post I will explain what is needed to get from assembly to c and print a  hello world message.\n  When a RISC-V cpu starts all its harts(hardware threads) start executing code from the address  0x80000000. In theory we could just write to the UART address to get things on the screen but since I don\u2019t like writing lots of assembly lets first jump to C and then display our message. To jump to C we need to setup the stack and park all the harts but one. The whole assembly code that setups stacks for each hart and parks not needed harts looks like this:\n .equ STACK_SIZE, 1024.global _start_start: # setup stacks per hart csrr t0, mhartid # read current hart id slli t0, t0, 10 # shift left the hart id by 1024 la sp, stacks + STACK_SIZE # set the initial stack pointer # to the end of the stack space add sp, sp, t0 # move the current hart stack pointer # to its place in the stack space # park harts with id != 0 csrr a0, mhartid # read current hart id bnez a0, park # if we&#39;re not on the hart 0 # we park the hart j enter # jump to cpark: wfi j  ...\n In the liker script we tell the linker to put the  _start symbol at  0x80000000, the  enter symbol is our entry point in C.\n  Awesome! we\u2019re in C, because we\u2019re going to use qemu to run the code the easiest way to get IO is to use UART, It\u2019s quite a big standart and I could write a whole post about it but for now we only need to know that according to qemu  source it\u2019s memory mapped at address  0x10000000 and writing to it will make things appear on the screen.\n UART has some registers for controlling it for now we only care about the line status register(or LSR) located at offset  0x05 from the base uart address(the full list of register can be found  here).The LSR can tell us whether we can write data the the UART buffer, the possible values of this register are  here\n  static  int  putchar ( uint8_t  ch )  {  static  uint8_t  THR  =  0x00 ;  static  uint8_t  LSR  =  0x05 ;  static  uint8_t  LSR_RI  =  0x40 ;  while  (( uart [ LSR ]  &amp;  LSR_RI )  ==  0 );  return  uart [ THR ]  =  ch ; }\n The uart variable is globally defined as  volatile so that the compiler doesn\u2019t try to optimize it out.\n  Because this code only writes a single character we need to create a helper function to write whole lines.\n  Now we can call  puts and hopefully we should see stuff appear on the screen:\n   typedef  unsigned  char  uint8_t ; static  volatile  uint8_t  * uart  =  ( void  * ) 0x10000000 ; static  int  putchar ( char  ch )  {  static  uint8_t  THR  =  0x00 ;  static  uint8_t  LSR  =  0x05 ;  static  uint8_t  LSR_RI  =  0x40 ;  while  (( uart [ LSR ]  &amp;  LSR_RI )  ==  0 );  return  uart [ THR ]  =  ch ; } void  puts ( char  * s )  {  while  ( * s )  putchar ( * s ++ );  putchar ( &#39;\\n&#39; ); } void  enter ()  {  puts ( &#34;Hello RISC-V&#34; ); }\n We can compile it using gcc  riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32 -T default.lds -o out -nostdlib -fno-builtin start.s main.cThe  start.s is our assembly source and the  main.c is our c code\n This should produce a file called  out which can be run using qemu:  qemu-system-riscv32 -nographic -smp 4 -machine virt -bios none -kernel out\n  This might not be much but It\u2019s a good start, for writing a whole kernel. In the future I\u2019d love to cover things like: interrupts memory management, unprivilaged ISA.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:55:25", "tags": "risc,adventures,uart", "title":

"note_en": "Sure, don&#39;t hoard toilet paper \u2013 but if policymakers fear fear itself, they&#39;ll downplay real dangers to avoid &#34;mass panic&#34;. Fear&#39;s not the problem, it&#39;s how we  channel our fear. Fear gives us energy to deal with dangers now, and prepare for dangers later.\n  Honestly, we (Marcel, epidemiologist + Nicky, art/code) are worried. We bet you are, too! That&#39;s why we&#39;ve channelled our fear into making these  playable simulations, so that  you can channel your fear into understanding:\n    This guide (published May 1st, 2020. click this footnote!\u2192  1) is meant to give you hope  and fear. To beat COVID-19  in a way that also protects our mental &amp; financial health, we need optimism to create plans, and pessimism to create backup plans. As Gladys Bronwyn Stern once said,  \u201cThe optimist invents the airplane and the pessimist the parachute.\u201d\n          So, let&#39;s make a very,  very simple &#34;epidemic flight simulator&#34;! In this simulation,   Infectious people can turn   Susceptible people into more   Infectious people:\n    It&#39;s estimated that,  at the start of a COVID-19 outbreak, the virus jumps from an   to an   every 4 days,  on average.  2 (remember, there&#39;s a lot of variation)\n  If we simulate &#34;double every 4 days&#34;  and nothing else, on a population starting with just 0.001%  , what happens?\n  Click &#34;Start&#34; to play the simulation! You can re-play it later with different settings: (technical caveats:   3)\n    This is the  exponential growth curve. Starts small, then explodes. &#34;Oh it&#39;s just a flu&#34; to &#34;Oh right, flus don&#39;t create  mass graves in rich cities&#34;.\n    But, this simulation is wrong. Exponential growth, thankfully, can&#39;t go on forever. One thing that stops a virus from spreading is if others  already have the virus:\n    The more  s there are, the faster  s become  s,  but the fewer  s there are, the  slower  s become  s.\n        But, this simulation is  still wrong. We&#39;re missing the fact that   Infectious people eventually stop being infectious, either by 1) recovering, 2) &#34;recovering&#34; with lung damage, or 3) dying.\n  For simplicity&#39;s sake, let&#39;s pretend that all   Infectious people become   Recovered. (Just remember that in reality, some are dead.)  s can&#39;t be infected again, and let&#39;s pretend \u2013  for now! \u2013 that they stay immune for life.\n  With COVID-19, it&#39;s estimated you&#39;re   Infectious for 10 days,  on average.  4 That means some folks will recover before 10 days, some after.  Here&#39;s what that looks like, with a simulation  starting with 100%  :\n            Red curve is  current cases  ,   Gray curve is  total cases (current + recovered  ),\tstarts at just 0.001%  :\n    And  that&#39;s where that famous curve comes from! It&#39;s not a bell curve, it&#39;s not even a &#34;log-normal&#34; curve. It has no name. But you&#39;ve seen it a zillion times, and beseeched to flatten.\n  This is the the  SIR Model,  5 \t(  Susceptible   Infectious   Recovered) \tthe  second-most important idea in Epidemiology 101:\n    NOTE: The simulations that inform policy are way,  way more sophisticated than this! But the SIR Model can still explain the same general findings, even if missing the nuances.\n  Actually, let&#39;s add one more nuance: before an   becomes an  , they first become   Exposed. This is when they have the virus but can&#39;t pass it on yet \u2013 infect ed but not yet infect ious.\n    (This variant is called the  SEIR Model  6, where the &#34;E&#34; stands for   &#34;Exposed&#34;. Note this  isn&#39;t the everyday meaning of &#34;exposed&#34;, when you may or may not have the virus. In this technical definition, &#34;Exposed&#34; means you definitely have it. Science terminology is bad.)\n  For COVID-19, it&#39;s estimated that you&#39;re   infected-but-not-yet-infectious for 3 days,  on average.  7 What happens if we add that to the simulation?\n  Red  + Pink curve is  current cases (infectious   + exposed  ),   Gray curve is  total cases (current + recovered  ):\n    Not much changes! How long you stay   Exposed changes the ratio of  -to- , and  when current cases peak... but the  height of that peak, and total cases in the end, stays the same.\n      Short for &#34;Reproduction number&#34;. It&#39;s the  average number of people an   infects  before they recover (or die).\n    R changes over the course of an outbreak, as we get more immunity &amp; interventions.\n  R 0 (pronounced R-nought) is what R is  at the start of an outbreak, before immunity or interventions. R 0 more closely reflects the power of the virus itself, but it still changes from place to place. For example, R 0 is higher in dense cities than sparse rural areas.\n  (Most news articles \u2013 and even some research papers! \u2013 confuse R and R 0. Again, science terminology is bad)\n  The R 0 for &#34;the&#34; seasonal flu is around 1.28  8. This means, at the  start of a flu outbreak, each   infects 1.28 others  on average. (If it sounds weird that this isn&#39;t a whole number, remember that the &#34;average&#34; mom has 2.4 children. This doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s half-children running about.)\n  The R 0 for COVID-19 is estimated to be around 2.2,  9 though one  not-yet-finalized study estimates it was 5.7(!) in Wuhan.  10\n  In our simulations \u2013  at the start &amp; on average \u2013 an   infects someone every 4 days, over 10 days. &#34;4 days&#34; goes into &#34;10 days&#34; two-and-a-half times. This means \u2013  at the start &amp; on average \u2013 each   infects 2.5 others. Therefore, R 0 = 2.5. (caveats:  11)\n  Play with this R 0 calculator, to see how R 0 depends on recovery time &amp; new-infection time:\n    But remember, the fewer  s there are, the  slower  s become  s. The  current reproduction number (R) depends not just on the  basic reproduction number (R 0), but  also on how many people are no longer   Susceptible. (For example, by recovering &amp; getting natural immunity.)\n    When enough people have immunity, R &lt; 1, and the virus is contained! This is called  herd immunity. For flus, herd immunity is achieved  with a vaccine. Trying to achieve &#34;natural herd immunity&#34; by letting folks get infected is a  terrible idea. (But not for the reason you may think! We&#39;ll explain later.)\n  Now, let&#39;s play the SEIR Model again, but showing R 0, R over time, and the herd immunity threshold:\n    NOTE: Total cases  does not stop at herd immunity, but overshoots it! And it crosses the threshold  exactly when current cases peak. (This happens no matter how you change the settings \u2013 try it for yourself!)\n  This is because when there are more non- s than the herd immunity threshold, you get R &lt; 1. And when R &lt; 1, new cases stop growing: a peak.\n  If there&#39;s only one lesson you take away from this guide, here it is \u2013 it&#39;s an extremely complex diagram so please take time to fully absorb it:\n    This means: we do NOT need to catch all transmissions, or even nearly all transmissions, to stop COVID-19!\n  It&#39;s a paradox. COVID-19 is extremely contagious, yet to contain it, we &#34;only&#34; need to stop more than 60% of infections. 60%?! If that was a school grade, that&#39;s a D-. But if R 0 = 2.5, cutting that by 61% gives us R = 0.975, which is R &lt; 1, virus is contained! (exact formula:  12)\n    (If you think R 0 or the other numbers in our simulations are too low/high, that&#39;s good you&#39;re challenging our assumptions! There&#39;ll be a &#34;Sandbox Mode&#34; at the end of this guide, where you can plug in your  own numbers, and simulate what happens.)\n  Every COVID-19 intervention you&#39;ve heard of \u2013 handwashing, social/physical distancing, lockdowns, self-isolation, contact tracing &amp; quarantining, face masks, even &#34;herd immunity&#34; \u2013 they&#39;re  all doing the same thing:\n    So now, let&#39;s use our &#34;epidemic flight simulator&#34; to figure this out: How can we get R &lt; 1 in a way  that also protects our mental health  and financial health?\n          Around 1 in 20 people infected with COVID-19 need to go to an ICU (Intensive Care Unit).  13 In a rich country like the USA, there&#39;s 1 ICU bed per 3400 people.  14 Therefore, the USA can handle 20 out of 3400 people being  simultaneously infected \u2013 or, 0.6% of the population.\n  Even if we  more than tripled that capacity to 2%, here&#39;s what would&#39;ve happened  if we did absolutely nothing:\n      That&#39;s what  the March 16 Imperial College report found: do nothing, and we run out of ICUs, with more than 80% of the population getting infected. \t(remember: total cases  overshoots herd immunity)\n  Even if only 0.5% of infected die \u2013 a generous assumption when there&#39;s no more ICUs \u2013 in a large country like the US, with 300 million people, 0.5% of 80% of 300 million = still 1.2 million dead...  IF we did nothing.\n  (Lots of news &amp; social media reported &#34;80% will be infected&#34;  without &#34;IF WE DO NOTHING&#34;. Fear was channelled into clicks, not understanding.  Sigh.)\n    The &#34;Flatten The Curve&#34; plan was touted by every public health organization, while the United Kingdom&#39;s original &#34;herd immunity&#34; plan was universally booed. They were  the same plan. The UK just communicated theirs poorly.  15\n    First, let&#39;s look at the two main ways to &#34;flatten the curve&#34;: handwashing &amp; physical distancing.\n  Increased handwashing cuts flus &amp; colds in high-income countries by ~25%  16, while the city-wide lockdown in London cut close contacts by ~70%  17. So, let&#39;s assume handwashing can reduce R by  up to 25%, and distancing can reduce R by  up to 70%:\n  Play with this calculator to see how % of non- , handwashing, and distancing reduce R: (this calculator visualizes their  relative effects, which is why increasing one  looks like it decreases the effect of the others.  18)\n    Now, let&#39;s simulate what happens to a COVID-19 epidemic if, starting March 2020, we had increased handwashing but only  mild physical distancing \u2013 so that R is lower, but still above 1:\n      This  reduces total cases!  Even if you don&#39;t get R &lt; 1, reducing R still saves lives, by reducing the &#39;overshoot&#39; above herd immunity. Lots of folks think &#34;Flatten The Curve&#34; spreads out cases without reducing the total. This is impossible in  anyEpidemiology 101 model. But because the news reported &#34;80%+ will be infected&#34;  ...\n  Due to the extra interventions, current cases peak  before herd immunity is reached. In fact, in this simulation, total cases only overshoots  a tiny bit above herd immunity \u2013 the UK&#39;s plan! At that point, R &lt; 1, you can let go of all other interventions, and COVID-19 stays contained! Well, except for one problem...\n  You still run out of ICUs. For several months. (and remember, we  already tripled ICUs for these simulations)\n  That was the other finding of the March 16 Imperial College report, which convinced the UK to abandon its original plan. Any attempt at  mitigation (reduce R, but R &gt; 1) will fail. The only way out is  suppression (reduce R so that R &lt; 1).\n        Let&#39;s see what happens if we  crush the curve with a 5-month lockdown, reduce   to nearly nothing, then finally \u2013  finally \u2013 return to normal life:\n      This is the &#34;second wave&#34; everyone&#39;s talking about. As soon as we remove the lockdown, we get R &gt; 1 again. So, a single leftover   (or imported  ) can cause a spike in cases that&#39;s almost as bad as if we&#39;d done Scenario 0: Absolutely Nothing.\n        This solution was first suggested by the March 16 Imperial College report, and later again by a Harvard paper.  19\n  Here&#39;s a simulation: (After playing the &#34;recorded scenario&#34;, you can try simulating your  own lockdown schedule, by changing the sliders  while the simulation is running! Remember you can pause &amp; continue the sim, and change the simulation speed)\n    This  would keep cases below ICU capacity! And it&#39;s  much better than an 18-month lockdown until a vaccine is available. We just need to... shut down for a few months, open up for a few months, and repeat until a vaccine is available. (And if there&#39;s no vaccine, repeat until herd immunity is reached... in 2022.)\n  Look, it&#39;s nice to draw a line saying &#34;ICU capacity&#34;, but there&#39;s lots of important things we  can&#39;t simulate here. Like:\n  Mental Health: Loneliness is one of the biggest risk factors for depression, anxiety, and suicide. And it&#39;s as associated with an early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.  20\n  Financial Health:&#34;What about the economy&#34; sounds like you care more about dollars than lives, but &#34;the economy&#34; isn&#39;t just stocks: it&#39;s people&#39;s ability to provide food &amp; shelter for their loved ones, to invest in their kids&#39; futures, and enjoy arts, foods, videogames \u2013the stuff that makes life  ...\n  Not saying we  shouldn&#39;t lock down again! We&#39;ll look at &#34;circuit breaker&#34; lockdowns later. Still, it&#39;s not ideal.\n  But wait... haven&#39;t Taiwan and South Korea  already contained COVID-19? For 4 whole months,  without long-term lockdowns?\n      &#34;Sure, we *could&#39;ve* done what Taiwan &amp; South Korea did at the start, but it&#39;s too late now. We missed the start.&#34;\n  But that&#39;s exactly it! \u201cA lockdown isn&#39;t a cure, it&#39;s just a restart\u201d...  and a fresh start is what we need.\n  To understand how Taiwan &amp; South Korea contained COVID-19, we need to understand the exact timeline of a typical COVID-19 infection  21:\n    If cases only self-isolate when they know they&#39;re sick (that is, they feel symptoms), the virus can still spread:\n      But, if we find  and quarantine a symptomatic case&#39;s recent close contacts... we stop the spread, by staying one step ahead!\n    This is called  contact tracing. It&#39;s an old idea, was used at an unprecedented scale to contain Ebola  23, and now it&#39;s core part of how Taiwan &amp; South Korea are containing COVID-19!\n  (It also lets us use our limited tests more efficiently, to find pre-symptomatic  s without needing to test almost everyone.)\n  Traditionally, contacts are found with in-person interviews, but those  alone are too slow for COVID-19&#39;s ~48 hour window. That&#39;s why contact tracers need help, and be supported by \u2013  NOT replaced by \u2013 contact tracing apps.\n  (This idea didn&#39;t come from &#34;techies&#34;: using an app to fight COVID-19 was first proposed by  a team of Oxford epidemiologists.)\n  Wait, apps that trace who you&#39;ve been in contact with?... Does that mean giving up privacy, giving in to Big Brother?\n  Heck no!   DP-3T, a team of epidemiologists &amp; cryptographers (including one of us, Marcel Salath\u00e9) is  already making a contact tracing app \u2013 with code available to the public \u2013 that reveals  no info about your identity, location, who your contacts are, or even  how many contacts you&#39;ve had.\n        Along with similar teams like TCN Protocol  24 and MIT PACT  25, they&#39;ve inspired Apple &amp; Google to bake privacy-first contact tracing directly into Android/iOS.  26 (Don&#39;t trust Google/Apple? Good! The beauty of this system is it doesn&#39;t  needtrust!) Soon, your local public health  ...\n  But what about folks without smartphones? Or infections through doorknobs? Or &#34;true&#34; asymptomatic cases? Contact tracing apps can&#39;t catch all transmissions...  and that&#39;s okay! We don&#39;t need to catch  all transmissions, just 60%+ to get R &lt; 1.\n    Isolating  symptomatic cases would reduce R by up to 40%, and quarantining their  pre/a-symptomatic contacts would reduce R by up to 50%  28:\n    Thus, even without 100% contact quarantining, we can get R &lt; 1  without a lockdown! Much better for our mental &amp; financial health. (As for the cost to folks who have to self-isolate/quarantine,  governments should support them\u2013pay for the tests, job protection, subsidized paid  ...\n  We then keep R &lt; 1 until we have a vaccine, which turns susceptible  s into immune  s. Herd immunity, the  right way:\n    (Note: this calculator pretends the vaccines are 100% effective. Just remember that in reality, you&#39;d have to compensate by vaccinating  more than &#34;herd immunity&#34;, to  actually get herd immunity)\n              But what if things  still go wrong? Things have gone horribly wrong already. That&#39;s fear, and that&#39;s good! Fear gives us energy to create  backup plans.\n      What if R 0 is way higher than we thought, and the above interventions, even with mild distancing,  still aren&#39;t enough to get R &lt; 1?\n  Remember, even if we can&#39;t get R &lt; 1, reducing R still reduces the &#34;overshoot&#34; in total cases, thus saving lives. But still, R &lt; 1 is the ideal, so here&#39;s a few other ways to reduce R:\n      You&#39;re right. Masks don&#39;t stop you from getting sick  29... they stop you from getting  others sick.\n    To put a number on it: surgical masks  on the sick person reduce cold &amp; flu viruses in aerosols by 70%.  30 Reducing transmissions by 70% would be as large an impact as a lockdown!\n  However, we don&#39;t know for sure the impact of masks on COVID-19  specifically. In science, one should only publish a finding if you&#39;re 95% sure of it. (...should.  31) Masks, as of May 1st 2020, are less than &#34;95% sure&#34;.\n  However, pandemics are like poker.  Make bets only when you&#39;re 95% sure, and you&#39;ll lose everything at stake. As a recent article on masks in the British Medical Journal notes,  32 we  have to make cost/benefit analyses under uncertainty. Like so:\n  Cost: If homemade cloth masks (which are ~2/3 as effective as surgical masks  33), super cheap. If surgical masks, more expensive but still pretty cheap.\n  Benefit: Even if it&#39;s a 50 \u201350 chance of surgical masks reducing transmission by 0% or 70%, the average &#34;expected value&#34; is still 35%, same as a half-lockdown! So let&#39;s guess-timate that surgical masks reduce R by up to 35%, discounted  ...\n      Masks  alone won&#39;t get R &lt; 1. But if handwashing &amp; &#34;Test, Trace, Isolate&#34; only gets us to R = 1.10, having just 1/3 of people wear masks would tip that over to R &lt; 1, virus contained!\n    Okay, this isn&#39;t an &#34;intervention&#34; we can control, but it will help! Some news outlets report that summer won&#39;t do anything to COVID-19. They&#39;re half right: summer won&#39;t get R &lt; 1, but it  will reduce R.\n  For COVID-19, every extra 1\u00b0 Celsius (2.2\u00b0 Fahrenheit) makes R drop by 1.2%.  35 The summer-winter difference in New York City is 15\u00b0C (60\u00b0F), so summer will make R drop by 18%.\n    Summer alone won&#39;t make R &lt; 1, but if we have limited resources, we can scale back some interventions in the summer \u2013 so we can scale them  higher in the winter.\n    And if all that  still isn&#39;t enough to get R &lt; 1... we can do another lockdown.\n  But we wouldn&#39;t have to be 2-months-closed / 1-month-open over &amp; over! Because R is reduced, we&#39;d only need one or two more &#34;circuit breaker&#34; lockdowns before a vaccine is available. (Singapore had to do this recently,  ...\n    A moderate amount of hygiene &amp; &#34;Test, Trace, Isolate&#34;, with a mild amount of &#34;Masks For All&#34;, then...\n    Not to mention all the  other interventions we could do, to further push R down:\n        Even under a pessimistic scenario, it  is possible to beat COVID-19, while protecting our mental and financial health.Use the lockdown as a &#34;reset button&#34;, keep R &lt; 1 with case isolation + privacy-protecting contract  ...\n  Sure, you may have dried-out hands. But you&#39;ll get to invite a date out to a comics bookstore! You&#39;ll get to go out with friends to watch the latest Hollywood cash-grab. You&#39;ll get to people-watch at a library,  ...\n    So now, let&#39;s plan for some  worse worst-case scenarios. Water landing, get your life jacket, and please follow the lights to the emergency exits:\n    You get COVID-19, and recover. Or you get the COVID-19 vaccine. Either way, you&#39;re now immune...\n    COVID-19 is most closely related to SARS, which gave its survivors 2 years of immunity.  36\n    There&#39;s reports of folks recovering from COVID-19, then testing positive again, but it&#39;s unclear if these are false positives.  38\n  One  not-yet-peer-reviewed study on monkeys showed immunity to the COVID-19 coronavirus for at least 28 days.  39\n  But for COVID-19  in humans, as of May 1st 2020, &#34;how long&#34; is the big unknown.\n  For these simulations, let&#39;s say it&#39;s 1 year.\t Here&#39;s a simulation starting with 100%  , exponentially decaying into susceptible, no-immunity  s after 1 year, on  average, with variation:\n          Now, let&#39;s simulate a COVID-19 outbreak, over 10 years, with no interventions...  if immunity only lasts a year:\n    In previous simulations, we only had  one ICU-overwhelming spike. Now, we have several,  and   cases come to a rest  permanently at ICU capacity. (Which, remember, we  tripled for these simulations)\n          Counterintuitively, summer makes the spikes worse  and regular! This is because summer reduces new  s, but that in turn reduces new immune  s. Which means immunity plummets in the summer,  creating  ...\n  Thankfully, the solution to this is pretty straightforward \u2013 just vaccinate people every fall/winter, like we do with flu shots:\n  (After playing the recording, try simulating your own vaccination campaigns! Remember you can pause/continue the sim at any time)\n        To be clear: this is unlikely.Most epidemiologists expect a vaccine in 1 to 2 years. Sure, there&#39;s never been a vaccine for any of the other coronaviruses before, but that&#39;s  ...\n  Still, infectious disease researchers have expressed worries: What if we can&#39;t make enough?  40 What if we rush it, and it&#39;s not safe?  41\n  Even in the nightmare &#34;no-vaccine&#34; scenario, we still have 3 ways out. From most to least terrible:\n  1) Do intermittent or loose R &lt; 1 interventions, to reach &#34;natural herd immunity&#34;. (Warning: this will result in many deaths &amp; damaged lungs.  Andwon&#39;t work if  ...\n  2) Do the R &lt; 1 interventions forever. Contact tracing &amp; wearing masks just becomes a new norm in the post-COVID-19 world, like how STI tests &amp; wearing condoms became  ...\n  3) Do the R &lt; 1 interventions until we develop treatments that make COVID-19 way, way less likely to need critical care. (Which we should be doing  anyway!) Reducing ICU  ...\n  Here&#39;s a simulation of  no lasting immunity,  no vaccine, and not even any interventions \u2013 just slowly increasing capacity to survive the long-term spikes:\n        Maybe you&#39;d like to challenge our assumptions, and try different R 0&#39;s or numbers. Or try simulating your  own combination of intervention plans!\n  Here&#39;s an (optional) Sandbox Mode, with  everything available.

It&#39;s let us answer questions about the past few months, next few months, and next few years.\n        Teams of epidemiologists and policymakers ( left,  right, and  multi-partisan) have come to a consensus on how to beat COVID-19, while protecting our lives  and  ...\n        For everyone: Respect the lockdown so we can get out of Phase I asap.

"note_en": "Increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2) not only adds to change in earth\u2019s climate, but also poses a significant threat to our cognitive competences, according to a new study at University of Colorado, Boulder.\n Prior to the Industrial Revolution, global  average concentration of CO 2 was about 280 ppm, but the most recent measurement at NOAA\u2019s Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii in 2019 shows the atmospheric CO 2  levels have plateaued at 414 ppm. Also the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, if not mitigated, could put the outdoor CO 2\u00a0levels at 930 ppm with 100 ppm higher in the urban areas by 2100.\n  Breathing in an area where concentrations of CO 2  are high could cause the CO 2 levels in our blood to rise. This reduces the amount of oxygen that reaches the brain, which in turn  increases sleepiness, anxiety, and undermines cognitive function. If you have ever been to lecture hall or conference room jammed with people, you get the feeling.\n CO 2 concentrations are generally higher in indoors than outdoors. The reason being both the CO 2 that is otherwise in equilibrium with the outdoors, and the CO 2 that apartment inhabitants generate as they exhale. Also the level of outdoor CO 2 in metropolis is much higher compared to cleaner locations like the countryside or rural areas.\n \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how high CO 2\u00a0levels get in enclosed spaces,\u201d  explained Kris Karnauskas, associate professor and lead author of the study. \u201cIt affects everybody \u2014 from little kids packed into classrooms to scientists, business people and decision makers to regular folks in their houses and apartments.\u201d\n  \u201cBuilding ventilation typically modulates CO 2\u00a0levels in buildings, but there are situations when there are too many people and not enough fresh air to dilute the CO 2\u201d  said co-author Shelly Mille. \u201cCO 2\u00a0can also build up in poorly ventilated spaces over longer periods of time, such as overnight while sleeping in bedrooms.\u201d\n For the study, Karnauskas and his team formulated a holistic approach that assesses predicted future outdoor concentrations of carbon dioxide and the impact of localized urban emissions, a model which studies the relationship between indoor and outdoor CO 2\u00a0concentration and how it impacts human cognitive faculties. They found that if the outdoor concentrations of the gas reach 990 ppm, it would push the indoor concentration at 1400, the effect of which can be detrimental.\n Evidence of people exhibiting substantial deficits in cognitive function after a sustained exposure to this level of CO2 has been demonstrated in some studies. Although the studies yield some conflicting results, most researchers seem to agree that elevated CO 2concentrations can cause disruption in high level cognitive domains like decision-making and planning. In fact, at 1400, our ability to make decision plummet by 25 percent and strategic thinking by 50 percent, the researchers found.  ...\n The effect that elevated CO 2 has on the cognitive function is much like what triggers  ocean acidification. Both are a \u201cdirect\u201d effect of the gas\u2019 concentration, and it\u2019s the elevated CO 2 that induces harm not the warming it causes.\n Cutting emissions is the most effective means to stop CO 2 from reaching harmful concentrations, but this would require globally adopted mitigation strategies like the ones put forth by the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the researchers say.\n \u201cThis is a complex problem, and our study is at the beginning. It\u2019s not just a matter of predicting global (outdoor) CO 2 levels,\u201d Karnauskas explained. \u201cIt\u2019s going from the global background emissions, to concentrations in the urban environment, to the indoor concentrations, and finally the resulting human impact. We need even broader, interdisciplinary teams of researchers to explore this: investigating each step in our own silos will not be enough.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:55:13", "tags":

This means if a person has an Insurance Policy for his health condition, he can face his health problems with the secure mind. People can set their minds stress free and look focus on other daily activities when they having Health  ...\n Insurance is not only for human lives and health. It is relatable for physical assets also. If a person has an automobile, there is a risk of road accidents and also damages for the vehicle. So he can get a Car Insurance Policy for the automobile and get a free mind. Because if he faces an accident or damage for the vehicle or third party, he can cover it with Insurance Coverage.\n  Insurance Company is the organization that collects everyone\u2019s funds as monthly premiums. And give the funds who need it at the times. Insurance Companies are not non-profitable organizations. But they are doing good social work. People know the risks of their lives. But they do not consider it to save their money. With Insurance Companies, people can save their money for their risks and get funds with interests when it comes to real risk.\n    Life Insurance is the Primary and most important Insurance Policy. Every person who is in up to 18 years old can start this policy. Here the main purpose is covering life. This is not for the person who has the policy this is for their family members. If a person dies due to any reason their family becomes helpless. If the person is the main income source of the family, this will be a more critical situation. The family has to manage funeral expenses and the rest expenses such as day to day  ...\n  Car Insurance is special for automobiles. As the law, every car owner has to have a Car Insurance policy. Some countries require this at least as Third Party Insurance. The third-party is anyone who hurts or damaged property by the respective automobile.  With this coverage, the car owner can manage the accident by covering the cost. Here different car owners have to pay different premiums due to o reasons which are considered by their Insurance Company. This premium is the basic answer for  ...\n  Health Insurance is also an Insurance Policy that covers people \u2019s life. But here mainly focus on the health condition and health problems of humans. Having Health Insurance coverage is a primary need in some countries. But middle-level countries still don \u2019t consider this as a law. Having a Health Insurance is like having a bank saving. People can cover their hospital bills by this policy. And most importantly, people can have their daily revenue when they got sicked. And also if a person  ...\n  Health Insurance Company is an Insurance Company that is taking the risk of the health-conscious of people. They are specialized in the Health category since other Insurance Companies covering all the risk opportunities of lives including assets too.\n Here people can take care of their health problems such as critical illnesses and hospital coverage with the Company. If they got sick or hospitalized, then the Health Insurance Company will take care of the doctor charges, hospital bills, and also the daily revenue of the person. All for these, customers have to pay a constant premium for the Insurance Company. Most of the time the premium is very affordable and little amount when comparing them getting coverage as health insurance benefits.  ...\n  The primary income-generating method for an  Insurance Company is the premium income and they have to cover all the expenses of operations of the organization. As an example, if an Insurance Company earned 5$ million as the collection of premiums. Then if they paid 4$ million as the claims, the rest of 1$ million is the revenue for the company.\n   The income generated from the premiums is not enough to maintain a company. They are investing to boost their financial strength in low-risk financial investment methods like the stock market, e-currencies. With this method, Insurance Companies can easily generate a higher income.\n  All the customers who are starting an insurance policy don\u2019t continue for the agreed period. If they got failed when paying the premiums, then the policy will automatically lapse due to the agreement. Then the paid premiums are cannot be taken by the customer. And the premiums can be taken for the company and they can reinvest them to make more money.\n  In some times, customers stop their insurance policies after a certain time. As the Insurance Agreement, there is a significant time in which customers can cancel the insurance policy and take the money back. Here, customers don \u2019t allow to take all the premiums and they only can get the interests for the period and other balance will keep by the Insurance Company. And again as the previous, they invest the money in low risk investing methods and create more money within the existing  ...\n As every profit-oriented organization, \u00a0Insurance Companies cannot survive in the industry without making money instead of premiums. Because premiums are not enough to continue the company healthily. Insurance Companies are the solution for peoples struggling moments when they got sick with critical conditions because they cannot pay the hospital bills at the same time they have sick. So Insurance Companies are doing a good job for human beings.

This column examines the persistence of corruption among a sample of privately held firms from 12 Central and Eastern European countries. Creating a proxy for corporate corruption based on a firm \u2019s internal inefficiency, it is suggested that corruption can enhance a firm \u2019s overall profitability. A channel analysis reveals that inflating staff costs is the most common approach by which firms divert funds to  ...\n      Corporate corruption exerts a number of adverse influences on a nation\u2019s economy (Mauro 1995).\u00a0The presence of corruption encourages the growth of unofficial economies and affects the ability of a nation to efficiently allocate resources or sustain economic growth (Tanzi 1983, Slemrod 2007). Corruption also impedes the development of market-supporting institutions such as independent legal or regulatory systems (de Soto 1989, Shleifer and Vishny 1993).\n In spite of these adverse effects, corruption persists. It remains a global phenomenon despite increased corporate transparency, expanded international capital flows, and enhanced institutional monitoring. We contend that corruption persists because of the economic and financial advantages it provides to firms. We also contend that corporate corruption continues to exist because it provides benefits to a firm. The access to regulators, bureaucratic waivers, and accelerated/more favourable  ...\n  To examine the persistence of corruption within a firm, we must measure it at firm-level. Our approach uses the concept of firm inefficiency, derived from a production function. Since a production function describe optimal output relative to inputs, any deviation from these levels can be seen as inefficient. After netting out common industry- and economy-wide factors, a residual inefficiency remains (Ferris at al. 2020).\n We then introduce the concept of an \u2018honest firm \u2019. An honest firm is one that is headquartered in a country with a low level of corruption. Foreign firms headquartered in countries with low levels of corruption should have a lower propensity to engage in illegal activities, even when operating abroad. This is because such firms tend to adhere to their home cultural and legal practices, regardless of their immediate operating environment (Stopford and Strange 1991, Fisman and Miguel 2007).  ...\n It is important to note that we use the term corporate corruption to include a broad range of illegal activities undertaken by firms. These consist of bribery, extortion, kickbacks, sweetheart contracts, tunneling, tax evasion, accounting fraud, and a variety of other activities that are prosecutable. These activities are reflected in a firm \u2019s internal inefficiency because they increase labour and operating costs. These expenses are often unassociated with any economic purpose and can  ...\n  The study examines 12 countries from Central and Eastern Europe from 2001 to 2015. We draw our data from the Amadeus database, which is maintained by Bureau van Dijk (BvD) and contains comprehensive financial and ownership information for private European firms. Our sample consists of 188,994 firm-year observations, spanning 15 years. To determine the extent to which corruption persists across our sample economies, we report the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), constructed by Transparency  ...\n Figure 1 Geographical distribution of country corruption by mean of the reversed CPI (100-CPI, i.e. a higher value means greater corruption)\n    In our analysis of corporate profitability, we find that corruption has a positive influence. This result holds whether we examine a firm\u2019s return to total invested capital (ROA), or to the return on equity (ROE). These results are consistent with the Corporate Advantage Hypothesis. That is, corruption persists because of its ability to improve overall corporate profitability.\n It might be the case that the various changes in financial reporting, and the expanded oversight of the financial system following the crisis of 2007, have made corruption less possible (or capable of generating profitability improvements) for the firm. We find that the 2007 Global Crisis did not have a meaningful effect on the relation between corruption and corporate profitability. This relation remains persistent and appears invariant to regulatory or disclosure changes mandated  ...\n To gain further insight into how corruption affects corporate profitability, we decompose the ROA and ROE measures into a firm\u2019s turnover, margin, and multiplier components. We conclude that corruption enhances investor returns as suggested by the Corporate Advantage Hypothesis. It appears to accomplish this by improving margins and turnover. These improvements occur through increased sales, or perhaps by reduced expenses. Corruption allows a firm to achieve both.\n Given that corruption is persistent (and is associated with increased profitability), we now examine precisely how this occurs. That is, we investigate exactly what channels firms use to divert capital to fund their corrupt practices. We identify four such possible channels. These candidate channels are partially selected on the basis of Moeller \u2019s (2009) observation that poor screening procedures for new employees, frequent related party transactions, close relations to suppliers,  ...\n In Figure 3 we summarise the findings for our channel analysis. We report the number of sample countries in which channel expenditures are positively associated with corporate corruption. We observe that staff costs are positively associated with corruption in eight of our sample countries. This is often due to the use of phantom employees to fraudulently transfer wealth from firms. Overstatement of material costs is yet another way that managers can steal money from their corporate  ...\n Figure 3 The number of sample countries in which channel expenditures are positively associated with corporate corruption\n   We find that corruption influences the returns enjoyed by a firm \u2019s investors. To understand how corruption improves profitability, we decompose our return measures into their margin, turnover, and multiplier components. Corruption works its effect on profitability through the improvement of both margins and turnover. We also find that corruption persists even after the extensive regulatory reforms following the Global Crisis of 2007. The additional disclosure requirements, and  ...\n These findings have important implications for policy development and future research. Our examination of the channels through which corruption occurs identifies a target for regulators, lawmakers, and other parties who have an interest in eliminating corruption from the greater political economy. Our analysis of corporate sales, margin, and profitability could be useful for the design and implementation of public policy aimed at economic growth and efficiency.

and generates the free category on it using  idris-ct. It then uses the initial state and path provided in the execution (call them  x and  [x1, ... , xn], respectively) to evaluate the composition  idx;x1;...;xn. It returns success or error depending if this defines a valid morphism in the free category or not.\n     This will install the binary in elba&#39;s binary folder. Typically  ~/.elba/bin if this folder is in your path you can simply call  fsm-oracle to test it out.\n You can find elba and instructions on how to install it on the  official repository.\n  Just put your input (as specified below) in a file, for example  input.JSON, and run:\n  If the execution is valid, Idris will return a json output of the following form:\n       Input has to be fed as JSON, and is converted to Idris terms and types through the use of  Typedefs. The Idris types for FSM executions are defined in the file  Tgraph.idr.\n The internal input format is a term of type  FSMExec, and is of the form (FSMSpec, FSMState, FSMPath). It consists of three things: A specification of the FSM on which executions are run ( FSMSpec), an initial state ( FSMState), and a list of actions to evaluate ( FSMPath).\n  The type of  FSMSpec is  (Nat,List (Nat Nat)): The FSM is specified as a pair, where the first component denotes the number of states (vertexes) of the FSM, while the second is a list of pairs of vertexes (edgelist) denoting the possible actions.\n For instance,  (5,[(2,1),(4,2),(0, 3)]) specifies a FSM having  5 vertexes, enumerated  0,1,2,3,4, and three possible actions: One going from  2 to  1, one going from  4 to  2 and one going from  0 to  3.\n The edgelist has to be in range as specified by the number of vertexes. As such, specifications such as  (5,[(7,1),(4,2),(0, 3)])or  (5,[(5,5)]) are considered invalid and will produce an error.\n  The type of  FSMState is  Nat. This specifies an initial vertex from which the computation has to start.\n The initial state has to be in range as specified by the number of vertexes in  FSMSpec. So, for instance,  4 is a valid state for the FSM  (5,[(2,1),(4,2),(0, 3)]), while  5 is not, and will produce an error.\n   Each number in the list has to be in range as specified by the length of the edgelist in  FSMSpec. As such,  [1,0] is a valid path for the FSM  (5,[(2,1),(4,2),(0, 3)]) (indicating to first use the action going from  4 to  2 and then the one going from  2 to  1), while  [3] is not.\n         Terms of type  FSMSpec as described above have to be fed as inputs, encoded in JSON format. The way JSON encoding is implemented can be found in the file  JSONFormat.idr.\n   To encode tuples, and the usual square bracket notation for lists. Pairs defining edges are encoded as:\n   Applying these definitions recursively, any term of type  FSMExec can be encoded. For example, the following is the JSON encoding of the input execution  ((5, [(1,1),(3,4),(2,1)]) , 2, [2,0,0]):\n {   &#34;_0 &#34; : {   &#34;_0 &#34; :  5,   &#34;_1 &#34; : [ {   &#34;input &#34;

"note_en": "In the spring of 2013, I cofounded a data analytics company. I had graduated from a  Johns Hopkins masters\u2019 program the previous spring, taken the summer off, and got hired in the fall to help spin up programming at a nonprofit. Three months in,  two friends and I left and started off on a journey together to do something that we knew nothing about.\n The six years that I was part of building that  early-stage company \u2014 turning an idea into something that customers paid for, uniting a team even when things were impossibly hard, and working together to create something from nothing \u2014 was the most rewarding and challenging experience of my life to date.\n Seven years later, that story continues. One of us leads on as the CEO, one of us continues a career in tech marketing and music, and one of us \u2014me \u2014 has joined an early-stage venture capital fund called   Squadra Ventures.\n Working with founders, entrepreneurs, and startup management teams over the last three months, it has become clearer that there are key moments in a company\u2019s life where if they had access to some information that people in the know take for granted, they could make better decisions, and possibly alter their trajectory. One of those key moments is when they\u2019re seeking investment.\n The points that follow are not secrets and they\u2019re not particularly novel. But, no one told us. So I assume no one has told you.\n These are the things that I have learned in my first 90 days as a VC that every startup founder should know about investors:\n  About 90% of the time, founders go into pitch meetings with a misguided approach. They get out their deck and spend 80% of their time walking through the slides and talking about all the great things that they have done so far \u2014their credentials, awards, the tech, and current customers with great titles. Then they spend the last 15 minutes of the meeting talking about their roadmap, highlighting their \u201cuse of funds \u201dand close with a statement on being the right team and their impressive line-up  ...\n   The accepted perception is that you have to pitch on who you are and what you\u2019ve done, you have to justify yourself, you have to prove that you are the one to do something. That you have to validate your past.\n The right team is the one that puts the time in to make a plan for how they are going to accomplish their goals. They don\u2019t only think about when things go well, or when things go bad, they think about when things get weird. They\u2019ve run the scenarios, and they know that they are raising funds not to just keep going, but to optimize their success in executing their plan.\n Great investors aren \u2019t rolling the dice on the market, or the valuation, or the team. They are investing in your plan. They are investing in the future. If an investor sets a 60 to 90 minute meeting, they are ready to go deeper. Don \u2019t walk them through your stock deck; they \u2019ve read it. Give a 10 minute overview of the company, then spend 80% of your time going through your action plan for the next 18 months, with a clear definition of how you are going to run the business, drive the product  ...\n   You would never go into a sales meeting without having done your research. You know who is in the room, you\u2019ve stalked their LinkedIn\u2019s and know who\u2019s been in what role and where they were before, you have an opinion on who the decision maker is and if you\u2019re really good you\u2019ve figured out a way you\u2019ll be able to connect on a personal level. You didn\u2019t have to go far to find this information, but you did have to put in the time.\n  But in many cases, I\u2019ve found that entrepreneurs haven\u2019t done that homework. You may have to have 100 meetings to get to the one or two that result in funding. Some entrepreneurs think that those 98 others were a waste of time. But what if from each of those other 98 meetings you did your research and got one piece of real help?\n Have an ask. Ask for feedback on a specific point or guidance on something that each person in the room cares about and knows about. Ask for an intro to that super relevant person you know they are connected to on LinkedIn that you\u2019ve been wanting to meet. Ask for feedback on the marketing approach you\u2019re using. Investors want to be helpful, they can\u2019t always do that with dollars. Doing the work upfront, means you can still benefit from their network and resources.\n Not only does this directly benefit you, but it also demonstrates to investors three absolutely critical entrepreneurial skills \u2014 you take initiative, seize opportunity, and know how to sell.\n  Meeting with investors is more like interviewing for a job than you think. An investor is trying to see if you and your company are the right fit for their portfolio. It \u2019s not just about if your business is a good business, but will your business benefit from their approach, network, resources, and support model. And just like interviewing for a job, you should be evaluating if the investor is going to be the right fit for how you plan to grow your company and what you want to focus  ...\n  \u201cWhen was your most recent investment?\u201d \u2014\u00a0If this was within the last six months, keep going! If they haven\u2019t written a check in over a year, they are likely not actively investing right now and you should shift the conversation to trying to understand how they could be helpful outside of capital.\n \u201cWhy did you invest?\u201d \u2014 Expect them to get excited! Hopefully, they\u2019ll talk about the relationship that they have with the entrepreneur, their passion for the space, or how they have been providing support to the company\u2019s growth. This way you\u2019ll get an understanding for what motivates them to invest.\n \u201c How is the company doing?\u201d \u2014 It doesn\u2019t matter if the answer to this is good or bad, it\u2019s just important that they are honest and that they know. If they don\u2019t know, because they haven\u2019t talked to the team in a while or they say something vague, they probably aren\u2019t going to be there when you really need their advice and support.\n \u201cWhat is a recent thing that you have done to add value to one of your companies?\u201d \u2014 Take the opportunity to see how personal the investor is willing to get. The answer can range from providing advice in a recent board meeting, hopping on a late night call to talk about a challenging situation, or a connection to a significant resource or prospect. You\u2019re looking for them to tell you a story about how they interact with their entrepreneurs to add value.\n \u201cWhat is your take on follow-on funding?\u201d \u2014 There will be lots of answers to this. Whatever the answer is, it will give you an understanding of not only how supportive the investor is to their entrepreneurs when things aren\u2019t going great, but how active and involved they intend to be for the duration of a company\u2019s journey.\n Investors expect you to do your diligence, too. Have this conversation early and make the diligence process a two-way conversation.\n  There is such a thing as good revenue and bad revenue. Good revenue is aligned with your mission. Bad revenue is money you take to have something in the bank. Good revenue builds out core features of your product. Bad revenue forces you to build one-off features to fulfill a contract. Good revenue comes from target market customers and enables you to convert their competitors and peers next quarter. Bad revenue comes from clients that you don \u2019t want to put on your logo slide. Good  ...\n   Every startup takes bad revenue to get by at some point. That point may be taking a consulting gig that lets you and your cofounder transition to full-time but not work on the business. That point may be taking on services work because a customer just loves your team so much and isn\u2019t able to integrate your product themselves. That point may be taking a contract just to get a logo, even when it has nothing to do with your mission.\n It\u2019s the ratio of bad revenue to good revenue, and how that ratio transitions over time, that counts. That\u2019s what an investor wants to know, and they want you to start the relationship from a place of trust. So if you\u2019re taking bad revenue say it. Don\u2019t hide it. It\u2019s much more obvious than you have led yourself to believe.\n  This of all things, is what I wish the most I had known before. As you probably don\u2019t know, after six years at the company I cofounded, I left and took a year of what I called personal sabbatical.\n What it really was an admission that in the last two years I was on the team I had become deeply unhappy. The work no longer fulfilled me. Something that I had been all-in on \u2014 customers that I had obsessed over, a product that I had made sacrifices to see succeed, and a team that I had invested so much of my emotions and time into to see grow and become fulfilled themselves \u2014 had left me completely broken and burned out.\n I realized over the last year that I did this to myself, and it was exhausting. It wasn\u2019t sabbatical, it was recovery mode.\n I realize now that founders face a choice. They stay who they really are and put it all out there: raw, unfiltered, truthful, determined, focused, in love with their work. Or, they give in to the prevailing startup culture that says you have be this way to get funding, you have to look like this to be taken seriously, you have to say this to get customers, you have to be who other people need you to be.\n At the time, I chose the latter. It worked for the company. It didn\u2019t work for me.\n Now on the other side of the table, I see more clearly than ever that founders who are to investors who they really are find the right match. They get into the right relationship that puts them on the path with the best chances to become great. No one can get to great if they aren\u2019t true to themselves, and no one builds the team around them that they need to be successful if they can\u2019t be who they really are.\n It\u2019s a choice you get to make every day. And every day you get to rechoose.\n  -30-\n  Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:54:44", "tags":

"note_en": "MENLO PARK, Calif., April 29, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Facebook, Inc. (Nasdaq: FB) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March\u00a031, 2020.\n  &#34;Our work has always been about helping you stay connected with the people you care about,&#34; said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and CEO. &#34;With people relying on our services more than ever, we&#39;re focused on keeping people safe, informed and connected.&#34;\n    In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Facebook is supporting the global public health community&#39;s work to ensure everyone has access to accurate information. We are also working to address the long-term impacts of the crisis by supporting industries in need and making it easier for people to find and offer help in their communities. We have committed over $300 million to date in investments to help our broader community during the crisis, including creating a $100 million grant program  ...\n  We launched a COVID-19 information center on Facebook\u00a0to provide real-time information, health and well-being tips, and the ability to offer and ask for help. We are also matching $20 million in donations to support COVID-19 relief efforts, providing health organizations with free ads and tools to track the pandemic, offering Workplace to government and emergency organizations for free, and donating $25 million to support healthcare workers on the front lines.\n  To help people stay connected as a record number of people use our services, we are making our apps more efficient and adding capacity, while also prioritizing enhancements in key services, such as\u00a0real-time video experiences and live game-streaming.\n      (1)    Includes a $3.0 billion legal expense accrued in the first quarter of 2019 related to our settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n    Facebook daily active users (DAUs) \u2013 DAUs were 1.73 billion on average for March 2020, an increase of 11% year-over-year.\n  Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) \u2013 MAUs were 2.60 billion as of March 31, 2020, an increase of 10% year-over-year.\n  Family daily active people (DAP) \u2013 DAP was 2.36 billion on average for March 2020, an increase of 12% year-over-year.\n  Family monthly active people (MAP) \u2013 MAP was 2.99 billion as of March 31, 2020, an increase of 11% year-over-year.\n  Capital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $3.66 billion for the first quarter of 2020.\n  Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities \u2013 Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $60.29 billion as of March 31, 2020. Following the end of the quarter, we entered into an agreement to invest in Jio Platforms Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited, for approximately $5.7 billion, and we paid the $5.0 billion settlement amount due under our modified consent order with the FTC, which took effect in April 2020.\n  Headcount \u2013 Headcount was 48,268 as of March 31, 2020, an increase of 28% year-over-year.\n    Our business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and, like all companies, we are facing a period of unprecedented uncertainty in our business outlook. We expect our business performance will be impacted by issues beyond our control, including the duration and efficacy of shelter-in-place orders, the effectiveness of economic stimuli around the world, and the fluctuations of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\n  Engagement \u2013 Our community metrics, including Facebook DAUs and MAUs and Family MAP and DAP, reflect increased engagement as people around the world sheltered in place and used our products to connect with the people and organizations they care about. We expect that we will lose at least\u00a0some of this increased engagement when various shelter-in-place restrictions are relaxed in the future.\n  Revenue\u2013We experienced a significant reduction in the demand for advertising, as well as a related decline in the pricing of our ads, over the last three weeks of the first quarter of 2020. Due to the increasing uncertainty in our business outlook, we are not providing specific revenue guidance for the second quarter or full-year 2020, but rather a snapshot on revenue performance in the second quarter thus far. After the initial steep decrease in advertising revenue  ...\n  Total expenses\u2013We expect to realize operational expense savings in certain areas such as travel, events, and marketing as well as from slower headcount growth in our business functions. However, we plan to continue to invest in product development and to recruit technical talent. In addition, we have committed over $300 million to date in investments to help our broader community during the crisis, which will have an impact on our financial performance this year.  ...\n  Capital expenditures\u2013Our significant investments in infrastructure over the past four years have served us well during this period of high user engagement. We plan to continue to grow our capex investments to enhance and expand our global infrastructure footprint over the long term. In 2020, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $14-16 billion, down from the prior range of $17-19 billion. This reduction reflects a significant decrease in our construction  ...\n  Tax rates \u2013 We expect our full-year 2020 tax rate will be in the high-teens, although we may see fluctuations in our quarterly rate depending on our financial results.\n    Facebook will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Facebook&#39;s earnings conference call can be accessed at  investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation. Facebook uses the  investor.fb.com and  newsroom.fb.com websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s Facebook Page ( https://www.facebook.com/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and  ...\n  Following the call, a replay will be available at the same website. A telephonic replay will be available for one week following the conference call at +1 (404) 537-3406 or +1 (855) 859-2056, conference ID 2865867.\n  Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the\u00a0investor.fb.com\u00a0website.\n    Founded in 2004, Facebook&#39;s mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. People use Facebook&#39;s apps and technologies to connect with friends and family, find communities and grow businesses.\n          This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating  ...\n    To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute  ...\n  We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n    Foreign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2020 using the prior year&#39;s monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\n  Purchases of property and equipment, net; Principal payments on finance leases.We subtract both net purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe  ...\n  For more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the &#34;Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results&#34; table in this press release.\n    (1)    Includes a\u00a0$3.0 billion\u00a0legal expense accrued in the first quarter of 2019 related to our settlement with the FTC.\n    Accounts receivable, net of

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n SUBSCRIBE\n  An Alaska  school board removed five famous \u2014 but allegedly &#34;controversial&#34; \u2014 books from district classrooms, inadvertently renewing local interest in the excluded works.\n &#34;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&#34; by Maya Angelou, &#34;Catch-22&#34; by Joseph Heller, &#34;The Things They Carried&#34; by Tim O&#39;Brien, &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; by F. Scott Fitzgerald and &#34;Invisible Man&#34; by Ralph Ellison were all taken off an approved list of works that teachers in the Mat-Su Borough School District may use for instruction.\n   The school board voted 5-2 on Wednesday to yank the works out of teachers&#39; hands starting this fall. The removed books contain content that could potentially harm students, school board Vice President Jim Hart told NBC News on Tuesday.\n  &#34;If I were to read these in a corporate environment, in an office environment, I would be dragged into EO,&#34; an equal opportunity complaint proceeding, Hart said. &#34;The question is why this is acceptable in one environment and not another.&#34;\n  &#34;Caged Bird&#34; was derided for &#34;anti-white&#39; messaging,&#34; &#34;Gatsby&#34; and &#34;Things&#34; are loaded with &#34;sexual references,&#34; &#34;Invisible Man&#34; has bad language and &#34;Catch-22&#34; includes violence, according  to the school district.\n  Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings.\n Dianne K. Shibe, president of the Mat-Su Education Association teachers union, said parents and her members were stunned by the board action.\n Even though the school board had listed an agenda item to discuss &#34;controversial book descriptions,&#34; Shibe said, no one believed those works were under serious threat.\n &#34;Most of the community didn&#39;t respond, because these books had been used forever,&#34; Shibe told NBC News. &#34;Now in retrospect, it&#39;s like, &#39;duh.&#39; I could have seen this coming.&#34;\n   &#34;This is not set in stone,&#34; she said. &#34;The union is all about educating students, and this flies in the face of educating students.&#34;\n Mary Ann Cockle,  owner of Fireside Books in Palmer, about a mile from district headquarters, said her store ran out of copies of the books within hours of the board&#39;s action.\n &#34;People who had read the books years ago are buying them to read again and to give away,&#34; Cockle said Tuesday. &#34;Our biggest outpouring of support are people buying the books and donating them or leaving them to us to distribute for free.&#34;\n A new shipment of &#34;Caged&#34; and &#34;Invisible Man&#34; arrived at Fireside on Tuesday, and Cockle expects them all to be gone by Wednesday.\n  &#34;I don&#39;t think they realized they were treading on censorship, and people are completely opposed to censorship,&#34; she said.\n Hart insisted that the books are not &#34;banned&#34; and said they all remain in district libraries.\n Even though students are still free to read the books on their own, Hart said, it would be unfair to ask teachers to have to navigate their pupils through the complicated subject matter.\n    &#34;The Jungle&#34; and &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; could be interpreted as advocating for socialism, while &#34;A Street in Bronzeville&#34; was called into question for showing too much &#34;realism&#34; in describing racism against African Americans, according to a

"note_en": "With systemd 245 comes systemd-homed. Along with that, Linux admins will have to change the way they manage users and users&#39; home directories.\n  When systemd was released in 2010, there was a storm of vitriol surrounding the change in how services were to be started in Linux. The new mechanism was touted as being bloated and far too complicated to be useful. Since then, all enterprise Linux distributions have adopted systemd and the majority of desktop distributions have as well.\n For those who aren&#39;t familiar with systemd, it is that which initializes all systems on the Linux platform. Anyone that manages Linux within a data center should be intimately familiar with this system. By providing all of the necessary controls and daemons for device management, user login, network connections, and event logging, systemd makes for easy resource initialization and management\u2014all from a single point of entry (systemctl).\u00a0  Prior to systemd every system and resource was managed  ...\n But one of the creators, Leannart Poettering, has always considered systemd to be incomplete. With the upcoming release of systemd 245, Poettering will take his system one step closer to completion. That step is by way of homed.\n   Before we dig into homed, let&#39;s take a look at the /home directory. This is a crucial directory in the Linux filesystem hierarchy, as it contains all user data and configurations. For some admins, this directory is so important, it is often placed on a separate partition or drive than the operating system. By doing this, user data is safe, even if the operating system were to implode.\n   However, the way /home is handled within the operating system makes migrating the /home directory not nearly as easy as it should be. Why? With the current iteration of systemd, user information (such as ID, full name, home directory, and shell) is stored in /etc/passwd and the password associated with that user is stored in /etc/shadow. The /etc/passwd file can be viewed by anyone, whereas /etc/shadow can only be viewed by those with admin or sudo privileges.\n  If login is successful, the system reads the /etc/passwd entry for the user to locate the user&#39;s home directory.\n  So, for the simple act of logging in, three mechanisms are required (systemd, /etc/shadow, /etc/passwd). This is inefficient, and Poettering has decided to make a drastic change. That change is homed. With homed, all information will be placed in a cryptographically signed JSON record for each user. That record will contain all user information such as username, group membership, and password hashes.\n Each user home directory will be linked as LUKS-encrypted containers, with the encryption directly coupled to user login. Once systemd-homed detects a user has logged in, the associated home directory is decrypted. Once that user logs out, the home directory is automatically encrypted.\n  Outside of including a much-improved security, systemd-homed will finally enable a truly portable home directory. Because the /home directory will no longer depend on the trifecta of systemd, /etc/passwd, and /etc/shadow, users and admins will then be able to easily migrate directories within /home. Imagine being able to move your /home/USER (where USER is your username) directory to a portable flash drive and use it on any system that works with systemd-homed. You could easily transport  ...\n This will not just apply to user files, but with personal settings, preferences, and even authentication information.\n This works by making use of the JSON user record to confirm user identity. How specifically this works will depend upon the mechanism used for storing/accessing user home directories. Such mechanisms include:\n  According to Poettering, LUKS is the most advanced and secure of the systems. With LUKS, an encrypted volume is stored on either a removable device or within a loopback file. The LUKS volume contains a single directory, named after the user, which becomes the user&#39;s home directory and contains a copy of the user record stored within the LUKS header.\u00a0  When the user successfully authenticates, systemd-homed unlocks the LUKS volume and compares the record stored within the LUKS header  ...\n  Unlike the current process of creating users (either with the useradd or adduser commands), systemd-homed will rely on it&#39;s own process of creating users. Fortunately, that process won&#39;t be terribly complicated.\n In fact, like many subsystems associated with systemd, systemd-homed will have it&#39;s own control command:\n    Where USERNAME is the username and REAL NAME is the user&#39;s first and last name.\n    Of course, such a major change doesn&#39;t come without its share of caveats. In the case of systemd-homed, that caveat comes by way of SSH. If a systemd-homed home directory is encrypted until a user successfully logs in, how will users be able to log in to a remote machine with SSH?\u00a0  The big problem with that is the .ssh directory (where SSH stores known_hosts and authorized_keys) would be inaccessible while the user&#39;s home directory is encrypted. Of course Poettering knows  ...\n Should Poettering not be able to develop a solution for the SSH conundrum, systemd-homed will have to be relegated to desktops and laptop distributions, leaving servers out of the mix. I cannot imagine that will fly with the systemd team.\n  At the moment, systemd 245 is still in RC2 status. You can download the source from the  systemd GitHub page, but know the installation is probably far more involved than you&#39;d want to bother with. The good news, however, is that systemd 245 should be released sometime this year (2020). When that happens, prepare to change the way you manage users and their home directories.\n You don&#39;t want to miss our tips, tutorials, and commentary on the Linux OS and open source applications.

"note_en": "Only a month ago, a stimulus bill of $2tn would have been unthinkable. Indignant deficit scolds would have asked how one planned to pay for it, and complained about burdening our grandchildren with debt and bankrupting our country. Bernie Sanders bent over backwards to explain how he was going to pay for a Green New Deal or Medicare for All. These programs don\u2019t seem as expensive any more. Suddenly the government is planning \u201chelicopter drops\u201d of cash. Larry Kudlow, who  relentlessly attackedthe  ...\n  Nobody is seriously asking how we are going to pay for this stimulus \u2013 and they shouldn\u2019t. It took a global pandemic to explode the myth that federal government spending has to be \u201cpaid for\u201d.\n The Covid-19 crisis has clearly demonstrated what should have been obvious already: provisioning society \u2013whether with food, disinfecting wipes, toilet paper or medical supplies \u2013is not a financial issue. If we can \u2019t produce enough masks, ventilators or food, finance will not help. Society \u2019s capacity to produce real output is what limits its ability to provision itself. And this is precisely what the virus threatens, as workers stay home, supply chains break down and businesses shut their doors.  ...\n On the financial side, a sovereign government can always afford to buy what is for sale in its currency, as Modern Money Theorists have long explained.  It cannot run out of money because it simply credits bank accounts when it spends. This is  not a prescription, but merely a description of what actually happens.  In the United States, Congress passes the budget, while the Treasury, in cooperation with its fiscal agent, the Federal Reserve, makes the necessary payments. This happens through the  ...\n  But what happens when ventilators and masks are not available for sale even as companies are operating 24/7? More money may not solve the problem, but the government still has a role to play. During the second world war, the US quickly became \u201cthe arsenal of democracy\u201d by repurposing its productive capacity to meet the needs of the war. Through diligent planning  \u201c[l]ipstick cases became bomb cases, beer cans went to hand grenades, adding machines to automatic pistols, and vacuum cleaners to gas  ...\n Buying into the deficit myth, for generations we have been living below our means \u2013 paralyzed by the belief that finance is the constraint. Prolonged periods of slack and jobless recoveries have disincentivized investment and hurt our productive capacity and labor productivity.  Even in good timesour economy leaves millions unemployed or underemployed and a significant amount of our capacity idle (before the epidemic, our factories were only operating at three-quarters of capacity). We have underinvested  ...\n  Once this crisis passes, the deficit scolds will be back at it again, trying to put roadblocks in front of progressive policies. We will be told we can\u2019t afford Medicare for All, Jobs for All, College for All or halting climate change. The centrists will try to get us back to \u201cnormal\u201d \u2013 ie an economy that leaves so many behind.\n It is imperative that we resist. What progressives need to push for is creating a different kind of economy through a Green New Deal. To do so, we need to distinguish between the myths and real constraints, understanding  \u201cthat what is technically feasible is financially possible\u201d for a sovereign government.  Affording the Green New Deal is about real resources and technology, not about finance.\n The original New Deal was also dogged by concerns about excessive government spending. The second world war eliminated that obstacle, unleashing extraordinary economic mobilization and decades of prosperity. Hopefully the coronavirus crisis will not be as destructive as the Great Depression, but if there is one thing it should destroy, it\u2019s the myth of the deficit.\n L Randall Wray, author of  Modern Money Theory: A Primer on Macroeconomics for Sovereign Monetary Systems;  Why Minsky Matters: An Introduction to the Work of a Maverick Economist; and  Understanding Modern Money: The Key to Full Employment and Price Stability, is senior scholar at the Levy Economics Institute and professor of economics at Bard College", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:54:06", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u6467\u6bc1,destroyed", "title": "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u6467\u6bc1\u4e86\u8d64\u5b57\u7684\u795e\u8bdd", "title_en": "Coronavirus has destroyed the myth of the deficit", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-deficit-american-economy", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u6467\u6bc1", "destroyed"]}]
