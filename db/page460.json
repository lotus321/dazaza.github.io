Working closely with cutting-edge deep learning teams across a variety of industries, a clear narrative emerged: without better infrastructure, training deep learning models at scale remains extremely difficult, as organizations move from research to production. This feedback led us to build the Determined Training Platform, which now powers teams of Deep Learning Engineers and large GPU clusters  ...\n Our innovative infrastructure platform is now ready for widespread adoption, and we\u2019re excited to share it with the DL community! Today we are announcing that  we have  open sourced our deep learning training platform under the Apache 2.0 license.\n  We designed the  Determined Training Platform to empower Deep Learning Engineers to focus on the task at hand \u2014 training high-quality models. To achieve this goal, our platform tightly integrates all of the features that a DL engineer needs to train models at scale, including:\n  High-performance distributed training that just works.Determined \u2019s distributed training support builds upon Horovod, a popular distributed training framework, but includes a suite of optimizations that results in twice the performance of stock Horovod. Moreover, Determined \u2019s distributed training support is easy to set up (no code changes are needed to move from single-GPU to distributed training), and allows multiple users to seamlessly share the same GPU cluster.

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has committed $250 million directly to fight the pandemic.\n Indeed, in  an interview with the Financial Times, the Microsoft co-founder pledged that the $40 billion foundation would give its \u201ctotal attention\u201d to a crisis that he fears will cost the world \u201ctens of trillions of dollars.\u201d\n He told the newspaper, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken an organization that was focused on HIV and malaria and polio eradication, and almost entirely shifted it to work on this. This has the foundation\u2019s total attention. Even our non-health related work, like higher education and K-12 (schools), is completely switched around to look at how you facilitate online learning.\u201d\n His fact-based approach and his defense of the World Health Organization have also put him at odds with a president for whom truth is, er, situational. This has  made Gates a target of right-wing attacks and conspiracy theories.\n The world\u2019s second-richest person stepping up in this arena is a contrast to the richest, Jeff Bezos, who is back hands-on at Amazon. The pandemic has brought hefty revenues to Seattle\u2019s largest company because of stay-home shoppers \u2014 but also unprecedented challenges. Bezos said Thursday the \u201ccurrent crisis is demonstrating the adaptability and durability of Amazon\u2019s business as never before, but it\u2019s also the hardest time we\u2019ve ever

Wall Street on Thursday by  posting a first-quarter profit despite the wider economic slowdown brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.\n  Today\u2019s tweet might be extra curious those who remember the details of Musk\u2018s settlement with the SEC over alleged securities fraud.\n Aside from having to step down as company\u00a0chairman, it requires someone\u00a0 double-check any Musk tweet that might affect\u00a0value of Tesla stock.\n When asked about how this process will work in  a 60 minutes interview, Musk said it himself: \u201cThe only tweets that would have to be say \u2018reviewed,\u2019 would be if it had a probability of causing a movement in the stock.\u201d\n After being pressed on how one would know if a tweet had that potential, he quipped: \u201cI guess we

Musk said someone had left the keys in the vehicle and the door open overnight, causing the Model S to enter into a \u201cwaiting for driver\u201d mode that depleted 2 percent of the vehicle\u2019s battery. This resulted in the slightly less than 400-mile range.\n Not so, said the EPA. \u201cWe can confirm that EPA tested the vehicle properly, the door was closed, and we are happy to discuss any technical issues with Tesla, as we do routinely with all automakers,\u201d an EPA spokesperson said in a statement to  The Verge.\n  On other technology fronts, we increased the range of model S and X yet again, this time to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X. Actually, we said that, actually, the model \u2014 the real Model S range is 400 miles, but when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, [EPA] left the car door open and the keys in the car, so the car - and it did this overnight.\n And so the car actually went into waiting for driver mode and lost 2% of its range. And as a result, it had a 391 test. As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we\u2019re actually confident that we will achieve a 400-mile-or-greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S, for the past two months \u2014 the true range of the Model S for the past two months has been 400 miles.\n  Update May 1st, 5:20pm ET:  Updated to include Musk\u2019s

"note_en": "The news that Professor John Martinis had resigned from Google sent ripples through the entire quantum community.\u00a0A few days after the announcement, I was on two previously scheduled calls with quantum executives and a call with another quantum\u00a0CEO.\u00a0Each was as baffled and as curious about Professor Martinis&#39; departure from Google as I was.\n  I had read a few quotes attributed to Professor Martinis as the reason he resigned.\u00a0Somehow the remarks seemed to lack enough \u00a0justification for such a big move on his part. I thought more detail was needed, and Professor Martinis agreed to clarify the record.\n  We are in an era of quantum experimentation and development. There are a handful of quantum scientists today that I believe will be historical figures a hundred years from now.\u00a0John Martinis is one of those people.\u00a0He has made monumental contributions to quantum computing, including handing Google the title to the historic achievement of quantum supremacy.\n     For those reasons, instead of an article with a few quotes by him, I decided to publish the full transcript of our conversation, and Professor Martinis gave his permission.\u00a0In the interview, he describes details of his complex situation and why he ultimately decided to resign. \u00a0Additionally, you&#39;ll find many nuggets and surprises in the \u00a0interview.\n  Small parts of the transcript have been edited for clarity and I have entered notes where appropriate. My original plan was to provide a summary of my thoughts and conclusions. However, Professor Martinis was completely open about his relationship with the hardware group and with his manager, Hartmut Neven, founder of the Google Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab. After reviewing the transcript, I felt everything was said that needed to be said. All my questions were answered. I will say  ...\n        I was very\u00a0curious about the reason you left Google. The quote that was attributed to you as the reason didn&#39;t make sense to me.\u00a0So maybe we could start at the beginning for some background.\n            Yes, that&#39;s right. I was a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and we had government funding and were doing quite well. Google got interested and my group and I came over to work at Google, basically because we both wanted to build a useful quantum computer.\n        I think at the time it was in the teens.\u00a0It was a good-sized group, but not everyone came over at first.\u00a0For most of the students, they came to Google after they graduated with their PhD.\n    I did a count and it appears that you and your group published about 200 papers while you were at Google.\n    While at Google, that seems high, but I have published a large number of papers in my career and a lot of them on quantum. I was also involved in other research.\u00a0I actually started with quantum computing when I was a PhD student way back in the mid-eighties at UC Berkeley.\n    What was the agreement when you first went to Google as far as maintaining a leadership role?\n    So, of course I had a leadership role at UC Santa Barbara, and I was quite concerned about changing that. When I moved to Google, Hartmut [Neven] was running the project.\u00a0He had started a quantum project [at google] and he&#39;s the one who wanted to hire me.\u00a0I was the head of the hardware group and he was head of the whole quantum AI group. So that&#39;s the way we started.\n    You did some amazing work while you were at Google. You\u00a0handed them the title to quantum supremacy. There was some controversy, but it was an important\u00a0milestone, and you did it.\n    We talked publicly about quantum supremacy for a couple of years and how we were going to do it. I think a lot of people thought it was a pretty bold milestone, but we were excited about the challenge.\u00a0I thought the later controversy drummed up by IBM was a kind of\u00a0fake news.\u00a0But in the end, it worked out okay, as controversy brought attention.\n    As it turned out, if you&#39;d used\u00a0a few more qubits, it would have been far beyond the reach of any classical computer and there would have been no question about its validity.\n    Yes, that \u2019s correct. Scott Aaronson at UT Austin wrote a piece in the New York Times describing the impact. You can quibble about details, but the strangest part is that IBM said that the Summit computer was able to do this, but it was basically a white paper, and they [IBM] actually didn&#39;t run a program. Of course, if you&#39;re going to claim something for experimental physics or computer science, you should actually run programs. I&#39;ve  ...\n    When did you first sense there was a problem with your relationship at Google with Hartmut Neven?\n    This is a complex situation, but I can outline it for you. There has been tension for several years now, but it mostly has been with the hardware group. It started around the time we first proposed quantum supremacy. To explain the tension, you should understand that my personal research style tends to be very intently focused. For example, with the quantum supremacy experiment, I focused on doing the experiment because I thought it would be  ...\n  Note: At this point, Professor Martinis asked me if I had read Peter Thiel&#39;s book,  Zero to One. Thiel was a co-founder of\u00a0PayPal and Palantir. He explained that Peter Thiel defines personality styles as either a definite optimist or indefinite optimist. Professor  Martinis considers himself to be a definite optimist. One quote from Thiel&#39;s book seems to mirror his thinking: \u201c\u2026a definite person determines the one best thing to do and  ...\n    It&#39;s okay. Anyway, he [Peter Thiel] says that most people in the US are indefinite optimists. And everyone says, oh yeah, we can build a quantum computer, but everyone is doing very general research on it, but with indefinite goals. My view is, I definitely want to create a quantum computer with some particular design. I saw the quantum supremacy experiment and I thought let&#39;s focus on this and let&#39;s get it to work. So, there&#39;s  ...\n        My personality is to intensely focus on some goal.\u00a0\u00a0I think this was hard on the group.\u00a0Once we got quantum supremacy to work, and we didn&#39;t need such intense focus, people naturally wanted more independence.\n  Also, leaders of the group came from UC Santa Barbara, and it&#39;s very natural to want to leave your advisor and form your own group and be independent.\u00a0Hartmut saw that too, and he is much more of an indefinite optimist than I am.\u00a0Seeing all\u00a0the tension, they [the group] and management thought it would be better if I wasn&#39;t leading the project anymore. Three people in the project would be co-leaders and I would be advising.\n        Initially, I thought it wasn&#39;t going to work for me. But it was clear that&#39;s what everyone wanted. We went ahead and I tried it for nine months. During those nine months I was productive, as I invented a way to scale up the qubits and solved some wiring technology. I was doing my job, but I felt uncomfortable about the direction the project was going on the five to ten-year time scale. After some other bad events happened,  ...\n    Yes, I completely understand. What was competing for control of the group at the time? Was it anything in particular or was it just that the group wanted more freedom?\n    Yes. I&#39;ll give you a\u00a0specific example that happened last year.\u00a0It was very difficult for me at the time.\n  When wiring a qubit system, it is very important to figure it out in a scalable, cost-sensitive way. I had been developing some new technology that was quite far along. I was quite proud of various inventions, as solutions were somewhat tricky, and you had to think very carefully about how to build a system. Wiring is funny as it is something that everyone thinks they can do, but it&#39;s subtle. But one theorist, who  ...\n  This went on and on, so I started talking to Hartmut about it, explaining that it didn&#39;t make sense. We have a relatively small group and we don&#39;t have an abundance of \u00a0resources. And I have it covered, so we should stop this other program.\u00a0But Hartmut didn\u2019t back me up and wanted to go ahead and try both.\n  I guess I just didn&#39;t handle that very well. I was the lead of the hardware group, but I couldn&#39;t stop a project that didn&#39;t make any sense to me.\n        More precisely, I had already lost control. I wasn&#39;t really leading the hardware group, but of course still felt responsibility, like getting the quantum supremacy experiment to work. In the end, Hartmut and I just disagreed on what to do. But he&#39;s the boss, so it \u2019s his decision. I think this whole year-long process made me very uncomfortable, and I just couldn&#39;t handle it because I have been making  ...\n    You were making good progress toward increasing the number of qubits. I think one of the quotes I read said that you were on the path\u00a0to making a quantum computer with a few hundred to a thousand qubits.\n    Yes, we have this plan, and even one for a much larger quantum computer.\u00a0As a definite optimist, I liked that we had a definite plan that made sense to the group.\u00a0After the quantum supremacy results, google management was very supportive, so everything was going great.\n        Yes, but I was not very happy because I disagreed with some important decisions. I had many talks with Hartmut about it, especially about the leadership role.\u00a0I thought it would be the most reliable path to follow my expertise, since I have had a successful history.\n  And in the end, I felt that the group had a good plan, and they know what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re all very smart, they&#39;re going to be happy doing it their way. And I can go off and do science in the way I know best.\u00a0I want to help the world of quantum computing in a way that makes sense to me.\n  I&#39;m sad because I really thought we really could build something amazing together, but you know, things don&#39;t always work out the way you want.\u00a0You just have to figure out the best way forward.\n    When you get in a situation like that, it&#39;s a lot easier if you just step away.\u00a0I assume you&#39;re going to keep working on quantum projects.\n    I&#39;ve had a lot of inquiries from people. And I still would like to build a quantum computer with this definite-optimistic approach.\u00a0But this requires a good amount of funding, so I\u2019ll see if it\u2019s possible.\n  One idea is to work with other qubits groups, who are making different qubits, to figure out how they can scale up and build a large quantum computer.\u00a0Because I have an example with superconducting qubits that I now understand well, I hope to use those ideas for these other approaches. So, this might be a great opportunity.\n        Yes, I would. We would obviously want to discuss all of this.\u00a0Maybe we just need right now some social distancing. I did like working for Google and Hartmut, and maybe there is some way to make everyone happy.\u00a0I wish them the best. They&#39;re a great team.\n        There&#39;s going to be some really nice papers coming out using the quantum-supremacy Sycamore chip. Maybe not be quite so impactful [as quantum supremacy], but they are really going to advance the field a lot in applications as a cloud quantum computer. There should be more great results coming out of the group in the next few years.\n        Oh yes.\u00a0Everyone is still working there, which is great.\u00a0They will have more independence and say in planning their project, so I am happy for them.\n    When do you think we&#39;ll see a useful superconducting quantum computer? Can we do it in the next five years?\n    Hartmut has talked about this, so I can explain some more. The Google plan is roughly to build a million-qubit system in about ten years, with sufficiently low errors to do error correction. Then at that point you will have enough error-corrected logical qubits that you can run useful, powerful algorithms that you now can&#39;t solve on a classical supercomputer.  ...\n    Well, that&#39;s all my questions. I really appreciate your time. Is there anything I didn&#39;t ask that you would like to say?\n    Oh, I&#39;m just going to say that technically the group at Google is doing great. They have a good plan. They have really good scientists there. And I&#39;m excited that they&#39;ll be able to make progress and push this forward.\u00a0I wish them the best.\n        Okay.

"note_en": "Google has been ordered to pay $40,000 in damages to a Melbourne lawyer after a Supreme Court of Victoria ruling found the internet giant was a publisher, and had defamed the man.\n Google had argued the automation of its search engines meant it was not a publisher\n George Defteros has successfully sued Google over web searches that brought up his name in relation to associations with Victoria&#39;s gangland figures.\n In today&#39;s ruling, Justice Melinda Richards has determined that Google was a publisher, despite denials by the company.\n The case centred on articles and images published by The Age newspaper in 2004, after Mr Defteros was charged with conspiracy over the murder of Carl Williams and other underworld figures.\n At the time, Mr Defteros ran a legal firm in Melbourne whose clients included gangland figures.\n The charges were dropped the following year, but Mr Defteros had surrendered his practising certificate for three years.\n Mr Defteros argued that in 2016 and 2017, searches on Google continued to turn up articles and hyperlinks to web material that defamed him, including an entry in the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia.\n  During a trial last year, Google&#39;s lawyers had argued it was not the publisher of the material and it had not defamed Mr Defteros.\n It submitted that the automation of its search engines meant it was not an intentional communicator of words or images, particularly if a user clicked through to another website.\n  &#34;The Google search engine \u2026 is not a passive tool,&#34; she wrote in her 98-page judgement.\n &#34;It is designed by humans who work for Google to operate in the way it does, and in such a way that identified objectionable content can be removed, by human intervention.\n &#34;I find that Google becomes a publisher of the search results that its search engine returns to a user who enters a search query.&#34;\n She also found that providing the hyperlink within the search results &#34;amounted to publication of the webpage&#34;.\n Justice Richards found some of the images were still brought up in internet searches up until March of last year \u2014 but publication of those images was not &#34;substantial&#34;.\n  Google had argued in the case that it was for the &#34;common convenience and welfare of society&#34; that it provided search results directly relevant to search terms and that in fact it had a &#34;duty&#34; to respond to searches.\n It also contended that there would be a &#34;chilling effect on freedom of speech&#34; if Google users were not able to readily locate relevant content.\n &#34;I could not be satisfied that it was reasonable for Google to rely on Wikipedia as a reputable source, given that its own Guidelines acknowledge the variable quality of Wikipedia pages,&#34; Justice Richards wrote.\n  In assessing the damages relevant to the defamation, Justice Richards looked at how many users had seen the articles and images and found publication was &#34;limited&#34;.\n She also analysed the degree of defamation, which she said was at the &#34;less serious end of the spectrum&#34;.\n &#34;I accept it was painful for Mr Defteros to be reminded of that time, which he has tried to put behind him,&#34; she wrote.\n   In a statement, Mr Defteros said the decision was &#34;a win towards restoring my reputation&#34; but he was &#34;disappointed with the amount of damages&#34;.\n &#34;Her Honour has found that Google is a publisher of the defamatory imputations once Google receives notice of a defamatory publication online as a result of the use of its search engine,&#34; he said.\n &#34;We are considering our position, and we will be taking advice from our legal team going forward.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-02

"note_en": "What if progress in Neural Networks came so far that now we can build systems that excel not only in classifying or detecting, but on generating something unique with style of given object, for example your text to Yoda speech?\n As first works of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs in short)  appeared in 2014, this field made huge steps forward and some astonishing breakthroughs. We have all heard about image style transfer: extracting the style from a famous painting and applying it to another image.\n  Examples of artwork generated with the Image Style Transfer algorithm But today we will look deeper into voice generation tutorial showing how to train Yoda text to speech model and in the end we will have complete Yoda voice by given text:\n  Also we will show you pipeline to generate voice of any character by few samples with his voice and even your own\n    We will use  Real-Time-Voice-Cloning which is an implementation of  Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time\n The goal of the underlined paper was to build a TTS system which can generate natural speech for a variety of speakers in a data efficient manner with addressing a zero-shot learning setting, where a few seconds of untranscribed reference audio from a target speaker is used to synthesize new speech in that speaker&#39;s voice, without updating any model parameters\n  But how the underlying idea of Image Style Transfer can be applied to sound? There is the way of converting audio signals to image-like 2-dimensional representation called &#34; Spectrogram&#34;, and it&#39;s the key for using specifically designed computer vision algorithms for audio-related tasks.\n   Let&#39;s take a closer look on what spectrogram really is. Given 1 dimension time-domain signal we want to obtain a  time-frequency 2-dimensional representation. In order to achieve that, the Short-Time  Fourier Transform with a window of a certain length on the audio signal was applied, considering only the squared magnitude of the result.\n  In order to make spectrograms even more useful for our task, each &#34; pixel&#34; (or magnitude value) conversion to the  decibel scale had place, getting the log of each value.\n Finally, by converting spectrograms to the  mel scale and applying a mel filter bank we will get &#34; mel-spectrograms&#34;\n    This allows each part to be trained on independent data, reducing the need to obtain high quality, multispeaker data.\n   Speaker encoder recieves input audio encoded as mel spectrogram frames of given speaker and process an embedding that captures &#34;how the speaker sounds.&#34;  It doesn&#39;t care about the words or background noise, rather than the voice features of the speaker such as high/low pitched voice, accent, tone, etc.\n All of these features are combined into a low dimensional vector, known formally as d-vector, or informally as the speaker embedding\n   The synthesizer takes a sequence of text\u200a-\u200amapped to  phonemes (the smallest units of human sound, e.g., the sound you make when saying &#39;a&#39;), along with embeddings produced by the speaker encoder, and uses the  Tacotron 2 architecture to generate frames of a mel spectrogram recurrently\n   In order to convert mel spectrogram made by the synthesizer into raw audio waves, the authors use a vocoder.\n It&#39;s based on DeepMind&#39;s  WaveNet model, that generates raw audio waveforms from text, and was at one point state-of-the-art for TTS systems.\n   Now when you familiar with theory and how it&#39;s implemented in real life, we will run the solution with  google colab notebook in order to receive immediate results with GPU on board, no matter what&#39;s device or hardware you use.\n   Follow described instructions from notebook bellow to synthesize Yoda&#39;s voice.\u00a0 Furthermore, in the end of it, you will have the opportunity to synthesize your own voice, so have fun with it!\n  What if progress in Neural Networks came so far that now we can build systems that excel not only in classifying or detecting, but on generating something unique with style of given object, for example your text to Yoda speech?

"note_en": "Christopher Wray, the FBI director who has been one of the  fiercest critics of encryption under the Trump administration, previously worked as a lawyer for WhatsApp, where he defended the practice, according to new court filings.\n The documents, which were released late on Wednesday night as part of an unrelated matter, show Wray worked for  WhatsApp in 2015 while he was an attorney for the Washington law firm of King &amp; Spalding.\n While there are sparse details about the precise nature of the work, the filings indicate that Wray strongly defended the need for end-to-end encryption in his previous representation of WhatsApp, the popular messaging application owned by  Facebook.\n Wray\u2019s earlier work \u2013 which has not previously been public \u2013 contradicts his current position on encryption, which protects users\u2019 communications and other data from being read by outsiders.\n The Trump administration and major technology companies like Facebook have been at odds over the need to offer customers encryption services, with the White House and law enforcement officials arguing the technology represents a security risk by protecting the communication of terrorists and criminals.\n Wray defended the administration\u2019s position as recently as February, when he claimed law enforcement would in effect be severely hampered if Facebook decided to move forward with plans to offer users end-to-end encryption in its messaging platform.\n \u201cWe have to have mechanisms to allow lawful access to protect flesh and blood Americans,\u201d Wray said at a congressional hearing. \u201cIf Facebook moves forward with the plans they have at the moment, we will be blinded.\u201d\n In a statement, the FBI said Wray could not comment on the scope of his representation. \u201cWhen he was an attorney in private practice [Director Wray] represented his clients \u2019interests and advocated on their behalf, as a result of which he earned a reputation as a highly skilled and sought-after legal professional. Like all other lawyers, his duty of loyalty was to his client, and he did not put his personal views ahead of his clients \u2019interests or allow them to affect the legal work he did  ...\n News about Wray\u2019s representation of WhatsApp was released as part of a legal dispute between WhatsApp and attorneys representing NSO Group, the Israeli spyware maker.\n WhatsApp has claimed that it is improper for NSO Group to be represented in their dispute by King &amp; Spalding given the firm\u2019s previous work for WhatsApp. It declined to provide more details about the previous case, which is

"note_en": "Planet of the Humans, which takes aim at the green movement, is \u2018full of misinformation\u2019, says one online library\n    A new Michael Moore-produced documentary that takes aim at the supposed hypocrisy of the green movement is \u201cdangerous, misleading and destructive\u201d and should be removed from public viewing, according to an assortment of climate scientists and environmental campaigners.\n The film,  Planet of the Humans, was released on the eve of Earth Day last week by its producer, Michael Moore, the baseball cap-wearing documentarian known for Fahrenheit 9/11 and  Bowling for Columbine. Describing itself as a \u201cfull-frontal assault on our sacred cows \u201d, the film argues that electric cars and solar energy are unreliable and rely upon fossil fuels to function. It also attacks figures including Al Gore for bolstering corporations that push flawed technologies over real solutions to  ...\n Planet of the Humans has provoked a furious reaction from scientists and campaigners, however, who have called for it be taken down. Films for Action, an online library of videos, temporarily took down the film after  describing it as \u201cfull o f misinformation\u201d, though they later reinstated it, saying they did not want accusations of censorship to give the film \u201cmore power and mystique than it deserves\u201d.  A free version on YouTube  has been viewed more than 3m times.\n A  letter written by Josh Fox, who made the documentary  Gasland, and signed by various scientists and activists, has urged the removal of \u201cshockingly misleading and absurd\u201d film for making false claims about renewable energy. Planet of the Humans \u201ctrades in debunked fossil fuel industry talking points\u201d that question the affordability and reliability of solar and wind energy, the letter states, pointing out that these alternatives are now cheaper to run than fossil fuels such as coal.\n Michael Mann, a climate scientist and signatory to Fox\u2019s letter, said the film includes \u201cvarious distortions, half-truths and lies\u201d and that the filmmakers \u201chave done a grave disservice to us and the planet by promoting climate change inactivist tropes and talking points.\u201d The film\u2019s makers did not respond to questions over whether it will be pulled down.\n Planet of the Humans has been shown at Moore\u2019s Traverse City film festival, where the producer said it was \u201cperhaps the most urgent film we\u2019ve shown in the 15-year history of our film festival\u201d. Jeff Gibbs, who wrote and directed the film, has suggested that unrestrained economic and population growth should be the target of environmentalists\u2019 efforts rather than technological fixes.\n  Climate activist  Bill McKibben, one of the targets for the film for allegedly being influenced by corporate money and for supporting the burning of biomass such as wood chips for energy, said the characterisations are untrue. McKibben has previously changed his views on biomass energy, which he now sees as being detrimental to climate action, and claims he has \u201cnever taken a penny in pay\u201d from any environmental group.\n \u201cI am used to ceaseless harassment and attack from the fossil fuel industry, and I\u2019ve done my best to ignore a lifetime of death threats from rightwing extremists,\u201d McKibben said. \u201cIt does hurt more to be attacked by others who think of themselves as environmentalists.\u201d\n Renewable energy has long been portrayed as expensive and unreliably intermittent by oil and gas companies and their lobby groups, which have spent several decades questioning the veracity of climate science and undermining efforts to radically reduce planet-heating emissions.\n In fact, the technology used for wind and solar energy has improved markedly in recent years, while the costs have plummeted. While electric cars often require fossil fuel-generated energy to produce them and provide the electricity to fuel them,  research has shown they still emit less greenhouse gas and air pollutants over their lifetime than a standard petrol or diesel car.
