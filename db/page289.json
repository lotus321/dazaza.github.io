"note_en": "Twitter is out of the office. Last week, the social media company\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, informed employees that many of them would be allowed to  work from home permanently, even after the Covid-19 pandemic subsides. Other tech giants, including  Google and Facebook, have not gone quite so far but have also said that they plan to continue working remotely at least through the end of 2020.\n This may be a sign of where things are headed for the other white-collar industries that take their cues from Silicon Valley in the design and culture of their workplaces. For an industry that thrives on disruption, this might be its most disruptive move yet.\n Part of what makes the move to remote work so remarkable is that the technology industry has resisted it for so long. From the midcentury-modern palaces to the playful campuses of today\u2019s tech giants, the industry has invested heavily in the idea that \u201cknowledge work\u201d depends on carefully designed office environments.\n Some facilities emphasized cloistered isolation, such as the elegant campus in Murray Hill, N.J.,  that  Eero Saarinen designed for AT&amp;T\u2019s Bell Labs in 1962. Tech companies founded in Northern California took a different tack, designing more free-flowing offices that mimicked the collaborative environment of the engineering lab. The layout of these offices encouraged what Bill Hewlett and David Packard, the founders of Hewlett-Packard, called  \u201cmanagement by walking around.\u201d\n As Silicon Valley grew in the 1980s, its offices were often hastily constructed,  proudly ugly concrete \u201ctilt-ups.\u201d But leaders of those companies still wanted to set them apart. Tandem Computers had an on-site swimming pool and hosted weekly \u201cbeer busts.\u201d Intel built jogging paths. These amenities helped recruit employees and delivered a message to them: With an office this great, why would you ever go home?\n  Thanks to Steve Jobs, the belief that serendipitous office encounters fueled creativity became gospel. When he was the chief executive of Pixar in 2000, he led a design for a new headquarters building that would maximize human interaction. At one stage, he recommended a single group of bathrooms for the entire campus. (That notion was mercifully dropped.)\n Other ideas became more influential. As Google expanded around the globe, it looked for locations with large footprints. Having as many employees as possible on the same floor was thought to increase  the chance of random encounters, so staircases were to be avoided.  Facebook designed its headquarters in Menlo Park along the same principle.\n  As the largest companies grew richer, their facilities become grander. Amazon created  spherical greenhouses at its Seattle headquarters where employees could gather to think and talk. Microsoft built \u201ctree houses\u201d for employees in nearby Redmond. Even IBM, which had once encouraged telecommuting as it expanded into consulting services,  pulled thousands back to the office in the 2010s with facilities featuring \u201chuddle rooms\u201d and \u201cidea parking lots.\u201d\n Ironically, it has been over the past decade \u2014 as mobile and cloud-based products made it far easier to work remotely \u2014 that companies invested in ever more lavish offices and doubled down on their commitment to having employees work in those offices, not remotely. After taking over the leadership of Yahoo in 2012 under intense scrutiny, Marissa Mayer banned telecommuting in one of her first moves as a new Silicon Valley chief executive. \u201cSpeed and quality are often  sacrificed when we work from home,\u201d the company\u2019s human resources director told employees.\n These ideas from Silicon Valley \u2014 about space, proximity and company culture \u2014 set a pace that other industries followed. Free snacks and Ping-Pong tables became common in all kinds of white-collar workplaces. The open office \u2014 the ultimate expression of Steve Jobs\u2019s belief in serendipitous encounters \u2014 has become ubiquitous, despite mounting evidence that such unrestrained  hubbub dampens collaboration rather than encourages it.\n  So what will happen now? If even a fraction of American companies follow Twitter\u2019s lead and make working from home permanent, the effects will ripple through many other sectors and into all the cities where tech companies have corporate homes. Commercial real estate will suffer, along with the janitors, shuttle drivers and security guards who keep high-tech campuses going.\n One of the biggest losers already is San Francisco. In 2011 the city gave Twitter and other companies a payroll-tax break worth  an estimated $70 million to locate in a struggling neighborhood, only to find that employees rarely ventured outside their luxurious headquarters to support the local businesses. The \u201cTwitter tax break\u201d expired last year, but now Twitter is gone as well.\n At the same time, a remote work environment could be a welcome change for employees. Life in Silicon Valley and other leading tech hubs was becoming so expensive as to be unsustainable, even for those earning six-figure salaries. Tech\u2019s always-on, always-present workplaces and the offices filled with amenities may have appealed to the young and untethered. But the corporate norms \u2014 which discouraged part-time work and telecommuting \u2014 contributed to the attrition of women after becoming parents.\n Tech leaders rightly worry about what will be lost when working remotely. \u201c What does burnout look like?\u201d the chief executive of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, mused last week. \u201cWhat does mental health look like? What does that connectivity and the community building look like?\u201d Remote environments will demand different approaches to mentorship, teamwork and fostering a shared sense of purpose. But the Covid-19 experiment has shown that Silicon Valley can survive on the tools it created for itself and others.\n Margaret O\u2019Mara ( @margaretomara) is a professor of history at the University of Washington and the author of  \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201d\n The Times is committed to publishing   a diversity of letters  to the editor.

The company doesn\u2019t want to build the next Google. Instead, it wants to power the search box on your website or app with instant letter-by-letter search results.\n The company is managing the search feature on Slack, Stripe, Under Armour, Twitch and 9,000 other companies. At its current run rate, Algolia processes 1.2 trillion searches a year. The company says it touches 1 in 6 web users each day.\n  \u201cThe story started right after the Series C,\u201d Dessaigne told me. Algolia raised  a $110 million Series C round at the end of 2019. \u201cI was super excited but what was most exciting for me was the potential of the company.\u201d\n \u201cSomeone with more go-to-market experience would probably be a better person at achieving that potential,\u201d he continued.\n I asked more directly whether the decision to replace him as CEO came from the board of the company or not. \u201cIt really started on my side. The board was supportive of the decision but it didn\u2019t come from them,\u201d he said.\n  Nixon was previously the CEO of  Alfresco, the company that developed an open source enterprise content-management startup that was acquired by private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners  in 2018. In the past, she held various positions as chief revenue officer, executive vice president of sales and senior vice president of corporate sales in different software companies.\n As you can see, Nixon has a ton of experience when it comes to sales and operations in general. Her experience will be valuable when it comes to scaling the startup.\n \u201cI\u2019m excited to be now part of the Algolia team and to be leading the company as of today,\u201d Nixon told me. Accel, the VC firm that led the Series C round in Algolia, was also an investor in Alfresco.\n The transition is going to take a couple of months and Dessaigne will stick around until July. He says that he doesn\u2019t have any concrete plan about what he\u2019s going to do next.\n Over the past year, Algolia has been ramping up executive hires. Jean-Louis Baffier joined as chief revenue officer, Ashley Stirrup joined as chief marketing officer, Kristie Rodenbush joined as chief people officer and Iain Hassall joined as chief financial officer. In other words, Algolia is growing up and preparing for the next phase.

"note_en": "\u201cThe   Experience,\u201d one of podcasting\u2019s longest-running and most popular shows, will be launching on   exclusively this year.\n The Rogan-hosted comedy talk-show series will debut on Spotify on Sept. 1, 2020, on a nonexclusive basis \u2014 before becoming exclusive to the platform later later in 2020 under the multiyear licensing deal.\n With Rogan, Spotify has landed one of the podcasting biz\u2019s whales. It currently ranks as the No. 2 most popular show on Apple Podcasts (after Barstool Sports\u2019 \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d), per Podcast Insights. A source familiar with the deal said Rogan became sold on Spotify\u2019s ability to build his audience worldwide, after initially resisting distributing the podcast on the platform because he saw it as primarily a music service.\n In addition to the podcast, JRE also produces corresponding video episodes, which will also be available on Spotify as in-app \u201cvodcasts.\u201d\n Rogan announced the deal on social media Tuesday,  touting Spotify as \u201cthe largest audio platform in the world.\u201d\n  \u201cThe podcast is moving to @spotify!\u201d he wrote on  Instagram. \u201cIt will remain FREE, and it will be the exact same show. It\u2019s just a licensing deal, so Spotify won\u2019t have any creative control over the show. They want me to just continue doing it the way I\u2019m doing it right now.\u201d\n Rogan said there will still be clips from the show shared on YouTube \u201cbut full versions of the show will only be on Spotify after the end of the year. I\u2019m excited to have the support of the largest audio platform in the world and I hope you folks are there when we make the switch!\u201d\n Since its launch in 2009, \u201cThe  \u201d has built a large, loyal and engaged fanbase tuning in to hear his discussions with a range of guests, including comedians, actors, musicians, MMA fighters, authors, artists and more.\n Under the distribution deal with Spotify, \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience\u201d will be available to Spotify\u2019s 286 million active monthly users free with ads (and without ads for premium subscribers). According to Spotify, \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience\u201d has long been the most-searched-for podcast on its service. The addition of \u201cJRE\u201d stands to accelerate Spotify\u2019s long-range podcast ambitions, which has included  acquisitions of Gimlet Media,  Bill Simmons\u2019 The Ringer and Anchor.\n Rogan, a stand-up comedian and actor, was previously best known for hosting NBC reality competition show \u201cFear Factor\u201d in the early 2000s (which he reprised in 2011-12). The Boston native also appeared in NBC sitcom \u201cNewsRadio.\u201d Currently, he has two stand-up specials on Netflix: 2018\u2019s \u201cStrange Times\u201d and 2016\u2019s \u201cTriggered.\u201d\n

"note_en": "Thousands of years ago, people were performing a form of surgery called &#34;trepanation&#34; that involves boring holes through a person&#39;s skull\n        For a large part of human prehistory, people around the world practised trepanation: a crude surgical procedure that involves forming a hole in the skull of a living person by either drilling, cutting or scraping away layers of bone with a sharp implement.\n To date, thousands of skulls bearing signs of trepanation have been unearthed at archaeological sites across the world.\n But despite its apparent importance, scientists are still not completely agreed on why our ancestors performed trepanation.\n Anthropological accounts of 20th-Century trepanations in Africa and Polynesia suggest that, in these cases at least, trepanation was performed to treat pain \u2013 for instance, the pain caused by skull trauma or neurological disease.\n Trepanation may also have had a similar purpose in prehistory. Many trepanned skulls show signs of cranial injuries or neurological diseases, often in the same region of the skull where the trepanation hole was made.\n But as well as being used to treat medical conditions, researchers have long suspected that ancient humans performed trepanation for a quite different reason: ritual.\n  The earliest clear evidence of trepanation dates to approximately 7,000 years ago. It was practised in places as diverse as Ancient Greece, North and South America, Africa, Polynesia and the Far East. People probably developed the practice independently in several locations.\n  Trepanation had been abandoned by most cultures by the end of the Middle Ages, but the practice was still being carried out in a few isolated parts of Africa and Polynesia until the early 1900s.\n Since the very first scientific studies on trepanation were published in the 19th Century, scholars have continued to argue that ancient humans sometimes performed trepanation to allow the passage of spirits into or out of the body, or as part of an initiation rite.\n However, convincing evidence is hard to come by. It is almost impossible to completely rule out the possibility that a trepanation was carried out for medical reasons, because some brain conditions leave no trace on the skull.\n However, in a small corner of Russia archaeologists have turned up some of the best evidence for ritual trepanation ever discovered.\n  The story begins in 1997. Archaeologists were excavating a prehistoric burial site close to the city of Rostov-on-Don in the far south of Russia, near the northern reaches of the Black Sea.\n The site contained the skeletal remains of 35 humans, distributed among 20 separate graves. Based on the style of the burials, the archaeologists knew that they dated to between approximately 5,000 and 3,000 BC, a period known as the Chalcolithic or &#34;Copper Age&#34;.\n  One of the graves contained the skeletons of five adults \u2013 two women and three men \u2013 together with an infant aged between one and two years, and a girl in her mid-teens.\n Finding multiple skeletons in the same prehistoric grave is not particularly unusual. But what had been done to their skulls was: the two women, two of the men and the teenage girl had all been trepanned.\n Each of their skulls contained a single hole, several centimetres wide and roughly ellipsoidal in shape, with signs of scraping around the edges. The skull of the third man contained a depression which also showed evidence of having been carved, but not an actual hole. Only the infant&#39;s skull was unblemished.\n The job of analysing the contents of the grave fell to  Elena Batieva, an anthropologist now at the Southern Federal University in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. She immediately recognised the holes as trepanations, and she soon realised that these trepanations were unusual.\n  They had all been made in almost exactly the same location: a point on the skull called the &#34;obelion&#34;. The obelion is on the top of the skull and towards the rear, roughly where a high ponytail might be gathered.\n  Less than 1% of all recorded trepanations are located above the obelion point. What&#39;s more, Batieva knew that such trepanations were even less common in ancient Russia. As far as she was aware at the time, there was just one other recorded case of an obelion trepanation: a skull unearthed in 1974 at an archaeological site remarkably close to the one she was excavating.\n Clearly, finding even one obelion trepanation is remarkable. But Batieva was looking at five, all of them buried in the same grave. This was, and is, unprecedented.\n   The obelion point is located directly above the superior sagittal sinus, where blood from the brain collects before flowing into the brain&#39;s main outgoing veins. Opening the skull in this location would have risked major haemorrhage and death.\n This suggests the Copper Age inhabitants of Russia must have had good reason to perform such trepanation procedures. Yet none of the skulls showed any signs of having suffered any injury or illness, before or after the trepanation had been performed.\n  In other words, it appeared as if all of these people were trepanned while they were completely healthy. Was their trepanation evidence of some sort of ritual?\n It was an intriguing possibility. However, Batieva had to give up the trail. She had many more skeletons to analyse from all over southern Russia, and could not afford to get sidetracked by just a few skulls, however enigmatic.\n Before she gave up, Batieva decided to search through Russia&#39;s unpublished archaeological records, in case any more strange obelion trepanations had been discovered but not reported.\n Surprisingly, she got two hits. The skulls of two young women with obelion trepanations had been discovered years earlier: one in 1980 and another in 1992. Each one had been unearthed less than 31 miles (50km) from Rostov-on-Don, and neither showed any signs of having been trepanned for a medical reason.\n This gave Batieva a grand total of eight unusual skulls, all clustered in a small region of southern Russia and potentially all of about the same age. A decade later, even more came to light.\n  In 2011, an international team of archaeologists was analysing 137 human skeletons. They had recently been excavated from three separate Copper Age burial sites around 310 miles (500km) south-east of Rostov-on-Don, in the Stavropol Krai region of Russia, close to the modern-day border with Georgia.\n The archaeologists had not set out to discover trepanations. They were there to learn about the general health of the prehistoric inhabitants of the region. But among the 137 skulls, they found nine with conspicuous holes.\n  Five of them were standard examples of trepanation. The holes had been made in a variety of different locations around the front and side of the skull, and all of the skulls showed signs of having suffered a physical trauma, suggesting that the trepanations had been performed to treat the effects of the injuries.\n But none of the other four trepanned skulls showed any signs of damage or disease. What&#39;s more, all four had been trepanned exactly above the obelion point.\n Quite by chance one of the researchers \u2013  Julia Gresky, an anthropologist at the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) \u2013 had already read Batieva&#39;s paper describing the unusual trepanations from the Rostov-on-Don region.\n Now Gresky, Batieva and other archaeologists have teamed up to describe all 12 of the obelion trepanations from Southern Russia.  Their study was published in April 2016 in the  American Journal of Physical Anthropology.\n  The 12 skulls would have been remarkable discoveries wherever they had been found. But the fact that they were all discovered in the same tiny corner of Russia meant that a connection seemed likely. If there was no link, the odds that a batch of such rare trepanations would turn up exclusively in southern Russia would have been exceedingly low.\n Gresky, Bateiva and their colleagues argue that, while this idea is difficult to prove, the clustering of these unusual trepanations suggests that southern Russia may have been a centre for ritual trepanation.\n  Maria Mednikova of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow is an expert on Russian trepanation. She believes that trepanations in specific, dangerous areas of the cranium may have been performed to achieve &#34;transformations&#34; of some kind. She suggests that, by trepanning in these places, people thought they could acquire unique skills that ordinary members of society did not have.\n We can only speculate as to why these 12 apparently healthy people were trepanned in such an unusual and dangerous way. But thanks to the trepanation holes themselves, we can infer a surprising amount about the fate of the people after they received their trepanation.\n One of the 12 skulls belonged to a woman under the age of 25, who had been buried at one of the sites near Rostov-on-Don. It showed no signs of healing, suggesting that she died during her trepanation or shortly afterwards.\n However, the owners of the other skulls seem to have survived their operations. Their skulls showed bone healing around the edges of the trepanation holes \u2013 although the bone never completely re-grew over the holes.\n  Three of the 12 skulls showed only slight signs of healing around the trepanation hole, suggesting that their owners only survived between two and eight weeks after the operation. Two of these individuals were women between 20 and 35 years of age. The third was an elderly person between 50 and 70 years old, whose sex could not be determined.\n The other eight skulls showed more advanced healing. Based on what we know about bone healing today, these individuals probably survived for at least four years after their operations.\n It appeared as if all of these people were trepanned while they were completely healthy\n These eight survivors included all five of the people from the mass grave near Rostov-on-Don, whose bizarrely-trepanned skulls first attracted Batieva&#39;s attention almost 20 years ago.\n The two men, two women and one adolescent girl had all survived with their obelion holes for years. The girl, who based on her skeleton was between 14 and 16 years old, must have been trepanned when she was no older than 12, and possibly much younger.\n It is still possible that these 12 people were suffering from diseases or head injuries. In that case, the trepanning operation may have worked for at least eight of them.\n But it is also possible that Batieva and her colleagues are right, and these people were trepanned for a ritual purpose. If that is true, we can only guess at what benefits they received \u2013 or believed they had received \u2013 throughout the rest of their lives.\n Join over five million BBC Earth fans by liking us on  Facebook, or follow us on  Twitter and  Instagram.\n If you liked this story,  sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called &#34;If You Only Read 6 Things This Week&#34;.

"note_en": "U.S. federal prosecutors are seeking the return to Iraq of a roughly 3,500-year-old clay tablet purchased by the Hobby Lobby arts and crafts store chain for display in the Washington, D.C.-based Museum of the Bible. The cuneiform tablet is described as &#34;stolen Iraqi property&#34; in a civil complaint filed Monday.\n  The  complaint details part of the journey of this fragment of the oldest known creation tale \u2014 from a palace library in ancient Mesopotamia to its present location in a Department of Homeland Security warehouse in Queens, New York.\n  It alleges that a major international auction house, unnamed in the complaint, obscured the provenance of the tablet, known as the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet, when it sold the tablet to Hobby Lobby in 2014.\n  Agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&#39;s Homeland Security Investigations seized the tablet last year from the Museum of the Bible, which, it said, cooperated with the investigation. Hobby Lobby&#39;s owners are the founders of the Museum of the Bible.\n  The prosecutors said the 5-by-6-inch tablet, which Hobby Lobby purchased for more than $1.6 million, is considered the property of the Iraqi government and should be returned.\n    &#34;Whenever looted cultural property is found in this country, the United States government will do all it can to preserve heritage by returning such artifacts where they belong,&#34; Richard Donoghue, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York,  said in a statement. &#34;In this case, a major auction house failed to meet its obligations by minimizing its concerns that the provenance of an important Iraqi artifact was fabricated, and withheld from the buyer information that undermined the provenance&#39;s reliability.&#34;\n  The Gilgamesh epic is a Sumerian poem believed to have been written at least 4,000 years ago. Sections of it mirror details of the Great Flood and the Garden of Eden stories from the Old Testament, which it predates. A 12-tablet version of the poem, written in the Akkadian language, was discovered in the ruins of the library in a palace of Nineveh in present-day Mosul, Iraq.\n     The Gilgamesh Dream Tablet recounts the hero describing his dreams to his mother, who says they predict the arrival of a new friend. &#34;You will see him and your heart will laugh,&#34; she tells him.\n  According to the complaint, the tablet surfaced in or before 2001, when an unnamed U.S. antiquities dealer examined it, laid out with other pieces on the floor of the London apartment of a Jordanian antiquities dealer known to acquire directly from the Middle East. Two years later, the U.S. dealer returned with a cuneiform expert, who determined that, despite the salt encrustations that made it difficult to read, the tablet was likely a piece of ancient literature \u2014 &#34;potentially rare and valuable&#34; \u2014 rather than a more common commercial and legal document.\n    It resurfaced in 2007, when it was sold to two other buyers, one of whom included it in a sales  catalog, claiming the tablet had been with a single U.S. owner for the previous 25 years. The asking price in the catalog was $450,000. It came with a false letter of provenance, claiming it had been acquired at a 1981 San Francisco auction in a box of bronze fragments, according to the U.S. complaint.\n  In 2013, the complaint says, a new owner of the tablet contacted the London office of the international auction house, wanting to sell it. But the U.S. antiquities dealer told the auction house&#39;s antiquities department head that the object&#39;s provenance would not stand up to scrutiny and it would not be suitable for public auction.\n  The following year, Hobby Lobby bought the tablet in a private sale, after a Hobby Lobby representative viewed the tablet in London. The auction house shipped the tablet to its New York office and, from there, hand-carried it to Hobby Lobby&#39;s headquarters in Oklahoma City, &#34;so that Hobby Lobby could avoid incurring a New York sales tax,&#34; according to prosecutors.\n     Hobby Lobby was  fined $3 million in 2017 for failing to conduct due diligence after federal authorities said it bought thousands of artifacts that had been smuggled out of Iraq. Some of the items on display at the Museum of the Bible had been looted from  previously unknown archaeological sites.\n  In a  statement in March, museum board chairman Steve Green said the institution had identified a further 5,000 papyrus fragments and 6,500 clay objects with insufficient provenance that would be returned to Egypt and Iraq.\n  In the 2017 settlement with federal authorities, Green committed to the museum exercising more oversight. Later that same year, the Museum of the Bible contacted the auction house to verify information about the origins of the Gilgamesh tablet. U.S. prosecutors say the auction house withheld information.\n  Iraq&#39;s ministry of antiquities told NPR that it is trying to determine whether the Gilgamesh tablet was among thousands of items stolen from one of its regional museums in 1991. After Saddam Hussein&#39;s invasion of Kuwait the previous year, the regime lost control of certain parts of Iraq. At least nine of the country&#39;s 13 regional museums were looted in the turmoil.", "posttime": "2020-05-20 03:37:42", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "With much fanfare and many hot takes on Twitter, Shopify launched one of their  \u201cmost significant products ever\u201d a few days ago:  a consumer-facing shopping app, simply called  Shop.\n Many have been interpreting this as a massive shift in Shopify\u2019s strategy to compete more directly with Amazon.\n  Inspired by the launch of Shop, I decided to write a two-part essay on ecommerce. The first part \u2013 the article you\u2019re reading right now \u2013 looks at the current state of online shopping. It explains the business model behind Shopify (and Amazon) and how Shop fits into that strategy.\n The second part \u2013 which I\u2019ll release next week \u2013 is an outlook on the future of ecommerce. It describes what I believe is currently missing in the shopping experience and what Shopify should build next.\n   To start things off, let\u2019s first take a look at how Shopify and Amazon operate \u2013 because while both of them are ecommerce companies, their strategies are actually fundamentally different.\n (Disclaimer: This section is essentially a   brash copy summary of  Ben Thompson\u2019s excellent analysis on the same topic)\n Shopify is first and foremost an infrastructure company. It provides a platform on which merchants can build their own stores to have a  direct relationship with their end customers. This is why the type of business Shopify enables is often referred to as \u201cdirect to consumer\u201d (D2C).\n  Amazon, on the other hand, is more of an aggregator. Alongside its own supply, Amazon lets any merchant sell their products on the Amazon.com website. But it is always Amazon which owns the customer relationship \u2013 never the merchant. The supply side becomes commoditized.\n  It\u2019s not just the two companies\u2019 strategies that are different \u2013 they also serve two completely different types of shopping behavior.\n  Any internet service can broadly be categorized based on two types of user actions:  Pull and push.\n Google is the perfect example of a Pull service. Users are actively looking for a particular piece of information or an answer to a specific question  (e.g. \u201c how to make pancakes?\u201d or \u201c are koalas bears?\u201c). Google\u2019s search engine lets you  pull that information.\n Facebook, on the other hand, is a typical Push service. The user behavior is a lot more passive since you don\u2019t have to actively ask for information. Instead, Facebook automatically  pushes the most relevant content into your newsfeed.\n Amazon is essentially the Google of ecommerce. It\u2019s primarily a search engine and works best when you already have an idea of what you want to buy. Amazon is not great at discovery though. It doesn\u2019t show you things you didn\u2019t even know you were interested in.\n  That question is a little more difficult because there\u2019s not one clear answer. Instead of one dedicated platform for product discovery, we have seen social networks like Instagram and Pinterest slowly morph into product discovery channels. And the fact that they are not pure ecommerce apps, but insert products between organic content, is probably exactly why they perform so well.\n The types of products that work particularly well on Instagram are things that are visually appealing. You don\u2019t see ads for HDMI cables or windshield phone mounts on Instagram \u2013 those are typical Amazon products.\n Instead, it\u2019s products like jewelry, cosmetics, fashion or home accessories that do well on Instagram \u2013 and those are classic Shopify D2C brands.\n Shopify is powering the infrastructure of the \u201cFacebook for ecommerce\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t own or control the entire channel. And that\u2019s a risk.\n    While some of that Instagram traffic might be organic, the most significant chunk of customers is coming from auction-based ads (due to Instagram\u2019s no-link-policy). This means that as competition increases  (and it always does once one D2C brand in a particular segment sees some success, because there aren\u2019t any real barriers to entry), ad prices go up.\n As a result, many of Shopify\u2019s merchants aren\u2019t really direct-to-consumer brands, they are more like direct-to-consumer-but-with-Instagram-in-the-middle-eating-all-of-their-margin brands.\n Instagram capturing most of the value is a perfect example of  why demand aggregation is always more powerful than supply aggregation. Too much reliance on a powerful gatekeeper like Instagram is a risk for Shopify and its merchants.\n   The first thing to note is that Instagram isn\u2019t the only product discovery channel driving traffic to Shopify stores. As mentioned earlier, there is not one leading contestant for the role of \u201cFacebook for Ecommerce\u201d. Pinterest, YouTube and Twitter are also product discovery engines (among many other services trying to do the same).\n One of Shopify\u2019s options is therefore to diversify the portfolio of user acquisition channels its merchants can use. This is why I find Shopify\u2019s  Pinterest and  Google Shopping partnership announcements from the last few weeks way more interesting than the launch of Shop.\n Shop has been touted as Shopify\u2019s own product discovery channel \u2013 which would be another way to tackle its current dependence on other platforms. Instead of relying on Instagram traffic, Shopify could simply start aggregating the demand side itself and become more of a marketplace like Amazon.\n But if you install and open Shop, you\u2019ll notice that that\u2019s not really what the app does. Instead of a feed with product recommendations, Shop connects you with merchants you have purchased from in the past.\n   Another option to defend Shopify merchants against ever increasing customer acquisition costs (read Instagram ads) is to simultaneously increase customer lifetime value. This is exactly what Shop is supposed to do.\n By connecting you with merchants you have bought from before, Shop will recommend you  additional products that you might be interested in from the same sellers. The result is higher post-purchase loyalty and thus higher LTV which makes it easier to justify high initial acquisition costs via Instagram.\n That being said, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine a future where Shopify also starts recommending products from other merchants. What exactly this should look like is the topic of part two of this essay, which I\u2019ll publish next week. Stay tuned.\n  Do you have feedback or thoughts on this post? If so,  I\u2019d love to hear them!", "posttime": "2020-05-20 03:36:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u601d\u8003,ecommerce,shopify", "title":

"note_en": "In the last couple of days, a new discussion about Node.js has surfaced after the first Deno release. In social media and technical forums, many developers are now talking about the destiny of the Node.js. And even some speculating that Node.js is going to die soon. Or eventually will. While I am not a foreteller, I have some insights to share with you. I particularly try to answer the \u201cIs Node.js dying\u201d question. I cover how the current panic over the death of Node.js is irrelevant even though there is supporting evidence for it.\n  Whenever a language or technology is born, many immediately start to talk about its death. You don\u2019t believe me? Just open Google and type\n  Literally, for any technology, you can find a bunch of articles that unarguably many are trash. Even for new technologies such as Kubernetes. Node.js is not an exception, either. But what heated the \u201cNode.js death\u201d topic is the first release of Deno.\n If you don\u2019t know what Deno is, just read the next section to have an idea about it. That helps you understand the atmosphere over the current panic.\n  Deno is a Javascript runtime written by the Node.js creator,  Ryan Dahl. The name is the natural sort of the word \u201cNode\u201d \ud83d\ude42\n The project was announced by Dahl in 2018 during his talk \u201c10 Things I Regret About Node.js\u201d. The Deno is written in Rust, by the contrast of Node.js that is written in C/C++.\n Deno has a single execution file with the zipped size of ~15 MB, at the time writing this article.\n  Additionally, it does not have an NPM like or a separate external package manager. It\u2019s built-in.\n Deno runs in a sandbox mode (means no direct access to file, network, and other IOs), so any permission should be explicitly given.\n   The main reason that suddenly start to think that Node.js is dying because version 1.0 of Deno released on 13th May 2020. Even though the project is been around for over two years, this release caused panic for Node developers in social media.\n Needless to say, there are lots of differences between Deno and Node.js. And Deno is not necessary a Node.js replacement (as of now), but many panicked anyway. I categorize the fear reasons and go through each separately.\n  One of the main reasons for the current situation is because both products have the same creator. And many think that Ryan Dahl won\u2019t spend any time over Node. Thus, Node.js is dying.\n While this is a valid assumption, it is fundamentally wrong. Node.js has a gigantic community that is much larger than many others. Thus, it is not a single person project.\n On the counter-argument, some compare Dahl\u2019s existence to Node.js with Linus Torvalds\u2019s existence to Linux. I tell you, that\u2019s not a correct comparison at all.\n First of all, Dahl has not been involved with Node.js since 2012. But Torvalds\u2019s been working on Linux over the last 30 years in one form or another.\n Second of all, there\u2019s no guarantee that even if Torvalds leaves the Kernel community, Linux will die. And also don\u2019t equalize the September 2018 mayhem in the Linux community with the Torvalds exit. The 2018 chaos was a dark monstrous event that a part of it was about Torvalds qutting.\n Lastly, Torvalds also created Git but is not maintaining it. He just handed over entirely. Has Git died?\n  Node.js community has a reputation for being a graveyard of unmaintained libraries. With no offense, the number of libraries that are born or die everyday outnumbers any person\u2019s cells.\n Every other day a new framework is created that becomes the community defacto for sometimes and then out of the blue, it goes unmaintained. With a quick search, you can find dozens of them in GitHub with many stars that no one is maintaining them.\n One may say if this is the current situation in the community what makes us think the same won\u2019t happen to Node.js?\n The answer is it depends. It depends on the community and corporations\u2019 supports. Not necessary through monetary funding, but more contribution and support wise. If the companies that are extensively using Node.js hire some people to actively contribute to the project, then the death of Node.js is almost impossible. Let me give you an example. Java\u2019s been around for 25 years. Besides its massive use on almost all devices, one of the reasons that Java longevity is due to corporations\u2019 support. Not only the Oracle\u2019s but also Amazon\u2019s, IBM\u2019s, and many other companies\u2019 support.\n But let\u2019s not forget that many companies use Node.js are startups that mostly have short lifespans and are on tight budgets. We can\u2019t account for those companies\u2019 contributions. It requires a big, wealthy company like Facebook or Google.\n If the community diverge and/or big corporations do not support Node, this is a valid concern that can put Node to the decline path\n  Of course. That\u2019s true. Wealth of experience and knowledge gained over building Node.js. So there\u2019s no surprise if Deno is better. But a technology is not only evaluated by its capabilities. That\u2019s just one of the factors. Usage and support are more important players. And Deno is not quite there because it is young. So node.js won\u2019t be dying immediately.\n But let\u2019s assume the worst. Then what happens? Read the next section for that \ud83d\ude00\n  In my research, I\u2019ve found that some people discuss the death of Node.js as if a person has just died. Well, the death of a language or technology is not the same as a person passing. It doesn\u2019t happen in a day.\n Change of technology usually takes years because companies can\u2019t replace their products overnight or in a month and then switch to a new one. Node is not an exception here. Node.js libraries don\u2019t work with Deno and it takes time to build. Also, don\u2019t forget about expertise availability. Currently, not many people are familiar with Deno to built production scale products. All of these will take a few years at least.\n  Even if the Node dies sooner than anticipated, there would be a job market for it. Of course not similar to COBOL. But at least for the next 5 years, there are jobs for it. That should provide enough buffer to Node developers to switch. Also since both Deno and Node are related to the JS world, switching from one to another won\u2019t be tedious.\n  Node.js is not dying at least for the next five years and the current argument over its death in social media is meaningless. While there are some speculations over its decline, none of them so far are definitive. Even assuming the worst against Node.js and in favor of Deno, companies still need time to switch to the new technology and libraries need to be built. If you are worry or even curious, I highly recommend you start to toy around with Deno.\n In the end, I want to clarify that I have no issue with Deno. It is a good project with a bright future. My intention in writing this article is not to diss Deno but to alleviate Node.js developers\u2019 stress.", "posttime": "2020-05-20 03:34:48", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

"note_en": "With travel restrictions in place worldwide, we\u2019ve launched a new series,   The World Through a Lens , in which photojournalists help transport you, virtually, to some of our planet\u2019s most beautiful and intriguing places. This week, Susan Wright shares a collection of photographs from a saffron harvest in the Abruzzo region of Italy.\n  Italy\u2019s Abruzzo region, although remote, has not been spared from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. The area has reported  thousands of cases and  hundreds of deaths.\n A few years ago, though, in happier times, I traveled to this isolated corner of Italy, east of the Apennine Mountains, to photograph the annual autumn saffron harvest.\n  It was my first adventure across the country\u2019s rugged central mountains \u2014 to the wilder side, away from the popular tourist spots, where the terrain is pristine and sleepy medieval villages are scattered throughout the pretty foothills.\n  Having grown up in a rural setting in Australia, I was fascinated by the Italian agricultural communities:\u00a0their deep connection to centuries-old traditions, and the infusion of their land and culture with an infectious love and passion.\n How wonderful that these rural communities throughout Italy come together for their annual festivals, known as sagre, which are often dedicated to a specific local food.\n Giovannina Sarra (often called the  Saffron Queen) and her family hosted me and a handful of others at their home. Early in the morning, in the Navelli plateau, we fanned out among the misty, violet-tinged fields and participated in the harvest.\n  Saffron, which is taken from the stigmas of the saffron crocus, is a lucrative crop. Also called oro rosso, or red gold, it was first introduced into the region around the 13th century \u2014 an import from Spain. Prized as an exotic spice, it was sold in the wealthier regions and cities of Milan and Venice, and abroad in France, Germany and Austria.\n  Saffron is harvested in the hours just before sunrise, while the crocus petals remain closed; this makes the flowers easier to pick and helps protect their precious crimson-red stigmas. The delicate buds are handpicked and placed into baskets.\n  Later, on the same day, the stigmas \u2014 three tiny threads per flower \u2014 are separated from the moist petals. It\u2019s a delicate process that takes hours with a skilled and patient hand.\n   In the evening, over an open wood fire, the bright threadlike stigmas are dried in wire baskets, a process that adds to the richness of both the color and the flavor.\n  It takes roughly 4,000 flowers to make one ounce of saffron powder \u2014\u00a0which means there\u2019s a staggering amount of labor packed into the tiny containers in which the spice is sold.\n  Not long ago, when I sat down to a mouthwatering plate of  Risotto alla Milanese (a dish that\u2019s infused with saffron), I recalled the early misty morning I spent with Gina Sarra\u00a0and her family.\n Ms. Sarra, I was saddened to learn,  died in 2018. The  saffron cooperative she and her family helped organize in the early 1970s is struggling now with market closures. And it will be a long time before life in Italy \u2014 for many weeks the  epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe \u2014 returns to normal.\n  But there\u2019s no doubt that families like the Sarras will one day return to the restorative power of their sagre \u2014 and to the many traditions that have endured for generations in the fields of the Navelli plateau and beyond.\n Susan Wright  is an Australian photographer based in Italy, where she has lived since 2003.

"note_en": "This year at an all virtual BUILD conference we had many exciting announcements for the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)! This blog post gives you a summary of all the WSL news, including what\u2019s available now and what you can expect in the future.\n     Support for Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2) distros is coming this month in the Windows 10 May 2020 Update\n 4 years ago, at Build 2016, Microsoft surprised the world by announcing Windows Subsystem for Linux \u2013 WSL (also known at the time as \u201cBash on Ubuntu on Windows\u201d). WSL enables Windows users to run native, unmodified Linux command-line tools and apps directly in Windows, alongside all their favorite Windows apps and tools. WSL usage has grown enormously from initially just a few thousand people downloading the first preview build to more than 3.5 million monthly active devices today!\n However, we wanted WSL to do more \u2013 to run all Linux apps and tools, and to run apps and tools faster. At Build 2019, the WSL team unveiled the first preview of WSL 2, which utilizes new capabilities in Windows\u2019 Hypervisor Platform to run distros and tools in containers,  atop a real Linux kernel image that is built and delivered by Microsoft, hosted in a lightweight VM, which boots from cold in less than 2s! This means that WSL 2 delivers full system call compatibility with a real Linux kernel and is 3-6x faster compared to earlier versions of WSL. You can easily set the version of any WSL distro to be using WSL 2 with the command:  wsl.exe --set-version &lt;distroName&gt; 2.\n The response from the community has been huge and, frankly, positively overwhelming \u2013 sincerest thanks to everyone who ran WSL 2, filed issues, and asked for features, you\u2019ve helped us make WSL2 even better than we hoped it could be!\n   Shortly after WSL 2 was announced, Docker Inc.  decided to host Docker Desktop for Windows atop WSL 2! Following a successful preview period, Docker has announced that Docker Desktop for Windows will now default to run atop WSL 2 when installed on the Windows 10 May 2020 update, which will bring  Docker Desktop to Windows Home users as well.\n This change to host Docker on WSL 2 will result in containers booting up faster, while consuming fewer resources on the host machine due to WSL 2\u2019s more lightweight footprint vs. full VMs.\n   You\u2019ll soon be able to install WSL with a single command. Just open a Windows Terminal and enter `wsl.exe \u2013install`\n One common complaint about WSL is that it\u2019s not easy to find and enable. We agree, which is why we\u2019re working on some improvements to the wsl.exe command-line tool to help you install WSL. Soon you will be able to simply install WSL by entering:  wsl.exe --install in your command-line!\n  This command will be added to every Windows machine so that all you need to do is open a Terminal window elevated with administrator privileges and run  wsl.exe --install. From there the WSL optional components will be enabled, and your specified distro will be downloaded and installed for you automatically upon restart.\n You can expect to see initial releases of this feature in the next few months in the Windows Insiders Fast Ring.\n  We\u2019re also introducing the change to make WSL 2 the new default distribution type when installing WSL for the first time. WSL 2 brings significant improvements and we found that the majority of our users on Insider branches are using WSL 2 distros. When developing  wsl.exe --install it made sense for it to default to what people are using: WSL 2, and we\u2019ve included this as well for any new installations of WSL when enabling the \u2018Windows Subsystem for Linux\u2019 optional component. You\u2019ll see these changes in the Insiders Fast ring in the next few months alongside the  wsl.exe --install improvement.\n  Adding  CUDA and/or  GPU Compute support to WSL has been our #1 most requested feature since our first release! Over the last 3+ years, the WSL, Virtualization, DirectX, Windows Driver teams, and our silicon partners have been working hard on a complex engineering feat to deliver this capability.\n This is why we\u2019re thrilled to announce that we will start previewing GPU compute support for WSL in Windows 10 Insider builds within the next few months!\n  DirectML The team will be releasing a preview package of TensorFlow with a DirectML backend enabling hardware agnostic acceleration of AI &amp; ML workloads across the breadth of Windows hardware \u2013 DirectML will also support native Windows too, including TensorFlow on Windows!\n Once this preview is released, you will simply need to ensure that you have the latest Windows Insider Fast build, WSL 2 installed, install the correct driver for your GPU from the hardware vendor, and then you\u2019ll be ready to start developing, training and testing your machine learning and AI models inside of WSL!\n  This change will be released to the Windows Insiders Fast ring in the next few months. For all the details of what this change means and how it was made possible, please read  the DirectX Developer blog post.\n  One of our other most prolific requests is to support not just command-line apps, but Linux GUI apps as well. For example, some users want to run their preferred Linux GUI text editor or IDE in a Linux environment and work on their code stored locally within their distro\u2019s filesystem, or simply develop Linux GUI apps on their Windows machine.\n Our goal is for you to be able to run Linux GUI apps on your desktop seamlessly alongside your Windows apps. This will enable you to use Linux apps to edit, build, and run your code, visualize data plots in Python, or even use applications that are optimized for a Linux environment.\n At BUILD we demonstrated an early version of this work, running a few GUI sample apps directly from WSL such as  Eye of Gnome,  gedit and the  mpv media player. These apps connected to a wayland server running inside of WSL, which communicated with a RDP client on the Windows host. You can see a screenshot of this in action below where we\u2019re running the GNOME file manager in WSL and Outlook side by side.\n  These changes are on the WSL\u2019s team roadmap and you can expect to hear more about this work by holiday 2020.\n  To summarize, once you update to the Windows 10 May 2020 Update you\u2019ll have full support for WSL 2 distros! If you join the Windows Insiders Fast Ring you\u2019ll be ready to start receiving the latest WSL features including the new install experience and GPU compute within the next few months.\n There\u2019s lots of exciting news and features coming to WSL, so please stay tuned to this blog for the details of any big announcements. You can follow me on Twitter  @craigaloewen or  members of the WSL team that are on Twitter for any news there as well. Please check out  Kevin Gallo\u2019s blog post for all of the Windows developer focused news from BUILD.

"note_en": "Microsoft is adding a built-in package manager to Windows 10. The company today announced Windows Package Manager at Build 2020, and it\u2019s a new, native package manager that is going to be built into Windows 10.\n A package manager, for those unfamiliar, allows users to quickly install software on their machine without having to manually go to every application\u2019s website or through the Microsoft Store.\n  Windows Package Manager is a new tool that will allow users to do exactly that. With the new \u201cwinget\u201d command, Windows Package Manager automatically gets the latest version of an app you want to download, validates its authenticity, and installs it on your machine. For example, to install the latest version of Windows Terminal ( which just hit 1.0 by the way), you can simply run \u201cwinget install terminal\u201d and install the latest version of the Windows Terminal without having to go to the Microsoft Store. You can also use \u201cwinget search\u201d to search for an app. Here are the other available commands:\n  Microsoft will offer its own first-party repository that includes popular Windows 10 apps, and you can also submit a pull request to add new apps (with manifest files). The company will also allow users to download apps  from third-party repositories, so you will be able to pull apps from a third-party source as well.\n Microsoft says the main reason behind the company making its own package manager instead of contributing to existing ones was security. \u201cOne critical concern we had was how to build a repository of trusted applications. We are automatically checking each manifest. We leverage SmartScreen, static analysis, SHA256 hash validation and a few other processes to reduce the likelihood of malicious software making its way into the repository and onto your machine,\u201d said Demitrius Nelon, a senior program manager at Microsoft.\n \u201cIf you are happy with your current package manager, keep using it. Our goal is to make installing software on Windows better for everyone,\u201d Nelon added.\n Windows Package Manager supports Windows 10 version 1709 and newer and it will come pre-installed with Windows 10\u2019s Desktop App Installer once it reaches version 1.0. For now, users will be able to use the Windows Package Manager by downloading it  from the GitHub repository here, via the Windows Insider program, or by joining the Windows Package Manager Insider program by sending their Microsoft Account email address to   [email\u00a0protected].\n Premium member comments on news posts will feature an elevated status that increases their visibility.This tab would allow you to participate in Premium comments with other premium members.Register to join the other Premium members in elevating the conversation!\n  Register or Subscribe\n  Don&#39;t have a login but want to join the conversation?

"note_en": "One evening in February, I went to hear a lecture at the Baltimore Underground Science Space, a community lab in a former bottle-top factory. Like several dozen other \u201cbiospaces\u201d around the country,  , as the lab is known, is animated by a spirit of subversive amateurism. Anybody can go there to learn about, and then do, the kind of cutting-edge bench science\u2014gene editing, synthetic biology\u2014that is generally confined to well-funded academic institutions and private corporations. Inside, a chalkboard with cartoon drawings of a microbe and a double helix welcomes newcomers, but the lab areas are seriously kitted out.   has a real-time PCR machine, the gadget that allows scientists to make millions of copies of a particular strand of DNA, in order to study and manipulate it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot else that\u2019s  super fancy,\u201d Lisa Scheifele, the lab\u2019s executive director, told me, though that might depend on how fancy you consider such items as a laminar-flow hood (\u201cfor working with cells and cultures that you really don\u2019t want contaminated,\u201d according to  the lab\u2019s Web site), an Alpha Innotech gel imager, or a negative-seventy\u2013degree storage freezer. \u201cWe have what we need,\u201d Scheifele said. \u201cYou can do most genetics here. You can do microbiology.\u201d\n  That night, two dozen people had filed in to hear Yann Huon de Kermadec\u2014a low-key thirty-three-year-old with a Ph.D. in protein biochemistry from the University of Grenoble\u2014talk about the Open Insulin Project, for which he hoped to recruit local volunteers. The project, which originated in 2015, at the biospace Counter Culture Labs, in Oakland, proposes a \u201cbiohack\u201d for a stark failing in the American health-care system: the rising cost of insulin, the synthetic form of the hormone that 7.5 million diabetics must inject daily in order to live. Its goal is to replicate the insulin that is manufactured and sold in this country by three pharmaceutical companies\u2014Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi\u2014and to publish a protocol for safely producing it. The three U.S. manufacturers have lately been charging upward of three hundred dollars a vial. Eventually, the project hopes to launch a network of patient-and-worker-owned co\u00f6peratives that will produce small batches of insulin and offer vials to diabetics for about seven dollars each. At the very least, Open Insulin wants to show that such pharmaceutical code-breaking can be done, in the hope that it will demystify the drug-production process.\n  The Baltimore lecture took place a few weeks before the  -19 crisis necessitated social distancing, so we sat in tight semicircles. Pepperidge Farm cookies and mixed nuts were set out on a table, near a book for sale called \u201c Zero to Genetic Engineering Hero: The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Programming Bacteria at Home, School &amp; in the Makerspace.\u201d A flyer advertised an event, BioPrinting Breakout, which promised to introduce \u201c3D tissue engineering to new audiences and applications.\u201d In the crowd, there were some hip-looking young couples, a middle-aged African-American man in a parka, and a sixty-one-year-old regular who works in computer security and loves the community-lab scene because, he told me, you can talk science as much as you want, whereas in \u201cnormal social situations people start running away.\u201d\n Huon de Kermadec, who wore Clark Kent glasses, jeans, and a gray hoodie, introduced himself as \u201ca French guy having my Ph.D. who followed my wife when she found a position.\u201d (He is married to Louise Lassalle, who also works with Open Insulin, and came to the U.S. to do a postdoc in biochemistry at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.) Huon de Kermadec was originally attracted to Open Insulin because he thought the lab work would be fun\u2014he loves the craft of biology but is annoyed by the academic pressure to publish. He noted to the audience that nearly half of American adults have diabetes or high blood-sugar levels, yet there are currently no generic forms of insulin available in the U.S., nor are there any mechanisms in place for controlling the price, as there are in Canada and in Europe. \u201cIf one of the three big companies increases the price, they all increase the price,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they can.\u201d He showed a slide of a chart depicting an exponential curve for insulin prices. In 1996, Eli Lilly introduced Humalog, its synthetic version of the hormone, at twenty-one dollars for a ten-millilitre vial; during the next two decades, the retail price increased tenfold. Sanofi\u2019s Lantus and Novo Nordisk\u2019s Novolog have similarly soared in cost. (Eli Lilly recently announced that, during the  -19 epidemic, it would lower the monthly out-of-pocket cost of insulin to thirty-five dollars, but the drug is a crucial source of revenue for the company, and the price will likely rebound.) Patients with Type 1 diabetes typically require two to three vials of insulin a month. Even if they have insurance, it doesn\u2019t necessarily cover the entire expense. A  2018 study conducted by researchers at the Yale School of Medicine found that one in four diabetes patients scrimped on insulin usage\u2014not filling prescriptions regularly, using less than prescribed\u2014risking kidney failure, blindness, and death.\n Jean Peccoud, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Colorado State University and the founder of the journal  Synthetic Biology, told me, \u201cThe price of insulin is something for which there is no technical justification, no justification other than greed. It\u2019s simple to make, with a large market. It should be as cheap as Tylenol.\u201d\n  The scientist who discovered that injections of insulin could save diabetics from a painful death wanted to see the drug affordable and widely available. In 1921, Frederick Banting, a Canadian orthopedist, derived insulin from the pancreases of dogs; he sold the patent to the University of Toronto for one dollar, clearing the way for it to be mass-produced. \u201cInsulin does not belong to me,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt belongs to the world.\u201d\n Open Insulin plans to use protocols laid out in published papers to perform genetic engineering on two organisms\u2014yeast and  E. coli\u2014causing them to produce insulin. This is how pharmaceutical factories generally make the drug. Last spring, the group announced that preliminary results indicated the successful insertion of a target gene into  E.\u00a0coli cells, and the subsequent production of a protein that converts into insulin. The next step was to assess the samples, using mass spectrometry and other technologies.\n When Huon de Kermadec mentioned this development, a guy with a close-shaved head and a Russian accent interjected to say that he ran a drug-testing lab, and wouldn\u2019t mind vetting some of Open Insulin\u2019s samples. The project was a \u201cfascinating testament to the prospect of citizens doing science,\u201d the man said. Still, he noted, maybe it would be simpler for people who needed expensive medications to get hold of them on the black market, or in other countries.\n Huon de Kermadec sighed. \u201cYou  could find a way with a black market,\u201d he said. \u201cBut who will have access to that? You don\u2019t change the system.\u201d Pacing the front of the room, he went on, \u201cWhat  we aim for is more changing the way this is produced. It doesn\u2019t  have to be a situation where Big Pharma exploits people\u2019s misery. We can design a better system.\u201d\n  Open Insulin has its critics, and not only lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry. Gregg Gonsalves, a professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, is a former member of  , which took a confrontational, anti-institutionalist stance to drug development during the   crisis. Yet Gonsalves told me that D.I.Y. medicine is \u201clike GoFundMe campaigns for basic health care\u2014a sign of a broken system.\u201d The D.I.Y. movement, he continued, \u201cis going down a dead end of desperation, when all that energy and anger might be better focussed on dealing with politicians\u201d and fighting for universal access to health care.\n  Yet, given the profound flaws of the American health-care system, there is something hopeful about Open Insulin\u2019s approach. The group is considering teaming up with local hospitals and pharmacies, which would help integrate its methods with those of mainstream institutions. Kelly Hills, a bioethicist at a consulting firm called Rogue Bioethics, appreciates Open Insulin\u2019s efforts, a feeling that has only deepened during the coronavirus crisis. She told me that the decentralized production of standard drugs in small community labs might be a way of insuring that we don\u2019t run into shortages when traditional supply lines are disrupted. Drug shortages occur fairly often, even when we\u2019re not dealing with a pandemic, and they are \u201cvery scary if you are life-dependent on a medication,\u201d Hills said. \u201cBut, if you have a community lab, you\u2019re skipping manufacturing delays and pauses at borders. It would be a huge stress relief if you knew you could go to a community lab and fill your insulin prescription for a month for a few bucks.\u201d The big question, she said, is whether Open Insulin can meet the exacting safety requirements mandated by the Food and Drug Administration.\n John Wilbanks, a health technologist at the research nonprofit Sage Bionetworks, told me that D.I.Y. medicine, for all its radical aspects, can be viewed as a quintessentially American project. \u201cWe have this whole culture of hustle and grind, in which you\u2019re supposed to find your own individual solutions,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n The D.I.Y.-bio movement, which emerged in the early two-thousands, seems almost evolutionarily adapted to its historical moment. It echoes aspects of startup culture, especially the early days of personal computing, with its garage-based origin stories. First came the hardware, then the software; now even the wetware of life can be created in people\u2019s homes. D.I.Y. bio reflects popular skepticism about professional authority and gatekeeping, but it is not skeptical about learning or expertise. i , a synthetic-biology competition for undergraduates which started at M.I.T. in 2004, has expanded to include people working in community labs and other extra-institutional scientists. The D.I.Y.-bio movement also feeds off the notion of the side hustle and the rise of Maker Faire events, which have lent hobbyists a cool new legitimacy. To some budding scientists who want to make a difference in the world, the challenges of climate change and pandemic disease have made biology more compelling than, say, computer science.\n  In recent years, it has become relatively easy for people to acquire sophisticated lab instruments such as PCR machines, atomic-force microscopes, and environmental sensors. For example, when new biotech companies fail, they tend to sell off their equipment for a discount, and community labs and biohackers scoop it up. Wilbanks told me, \u201cD.I.Y. bio is very similar to the home-brew, hacker-club culture of the late seventies in Silicon Valley. If you\u2019ve not gone on eBay to shop for a DNA sequencer that they can ship to you in twenty-four hours, check it out\u2014there\u2019s a massive secondary market.\u201d\n The D.I.Y.-bio ecosystem includes a lot of do-gooders, and many of them have been galvanized by the  -19 crisis. Ellen Jorgensen is a molecular biologist and a founder of GenSpace, the country\u2019s first community lab, which opened in Brooklyn in 2010. She is now a biotech executive, but she continues to believe in the possibilities of D.I.Y. bio. Under the auspices of Just One Giant Lab, a collaborative network founded in Paris, Jorgensen is leading research on a diagnostic  -19 test that would eliminate the need for PCR machines, which, as commonplace as they have become in the U.S., are hard to come by in poorer parts of the world. Jorgensen\u2019s team is developing a  -19 testing protocol based\u00a0on loop-mediated isothermal amplification, a low-cost method of replicating a virus\u2019s genetic material, initially developed by researchers in Japan; according to  Just One Giant Lab\u2019s Web page, the process \u201ccan be done in a cup of hot\u00a0water.\u201d\n Another veteran of GenSpace, Will Canine, co-founded a company that makes open-source robots. The machines allow labs to automate a tedious task required in a lot of modern biological research: dispensing precise amounts of liquids, over and over again. When the coronavirus emerged, a hundred and seventy of Canine\u2019s machines were repurposed by a public-private partnership, the Covichain Robots Initiative, and shipped, at no cost, to hospitals in Spain. The robots can make testing for  -19 speedier and cheaper, and help eliminate humans from labs at a time when social distancing is crucial. Canine told me that D.I.Y. bio has a lot to teach our pandemic world. The movement has learned to use accessible language without dumbing down science, and it has also learned what  not to do: \u201cspeculate about scientifically invalid and dangerous things in public forums\u201d; \u201choard protocols, data, equipment, reagents, or anything else that could be broadly useful to others.\u201d Canine added that \u201cD.I.Y. bio should\u00a0not\u00a0be concerned with doing the most bleeding-edge experiments but, rather, with making the most relevant scientific knowledge and tools available to those otherwise excluded from them.\u201d\n The D.I.Y.-bio spectrum includes anarcho-libertarians. To the frustration of people like Jorgensen and Canine, this bro-ish element tends to attract media attention, because of a predilection for live-streaming stunts. In 2018, at a conference in Austin, the twenty-eight-year-old biohacker Aaron Traywick live-streamed his self-injection of a D.I.Y. treatment for genital herpes. (It\u2019s unclear if it worked; Traywick died later that year, in Washington, D.C., while using a sensory-deprivation tank.) This part of the movement includes gonzo self-experimenters, transhumanists seeking to extend their life spans, and people eager to become cyborgs\u2014by, say, implanting microchips in their arms which contain their medical records. One person I spoke to called this cohort the \u201cYou did  what?\u201d crowd. Another said that such people followed a credo of \u201cbecause it\u2019s cool, and because we can.\u201d\n Perhaps the best known of these edgier types is Josiah Zayner, a biohacking entrepreneur with a Ph.D. in biophysics from the University of Chicago, a cheeky public persona, and a slyly contentious relationship with regulatory authorities. In 2017, Zayner live-streamed his self-injection of   gene-editing technology, which was an attempt to enhance his muscles. (It didn\u2019t work.) He also documented a self-experiment in which he transplanted matter from a friend\u2019s donated stool into his gut, thus altering his microbiome. He now has a company, the Odin, which sells mail-order kits that allow you to try your hand at  , make glow-in-the-dark yeast, and genetically engineer tree frogs. Zayner seems to embrace the idea that the only interesting scientist is a mad one.\n  Last August, at a conference in Las Vegas called Biohack the Planet, Zayner gave a speech in which he noted that, in such nearby countries as the Dominican Republic, there were many desperate patients who\u2019d be willing to try any kind of experimental gene therapy, even if there was a good chance that it would kill them. D.I.Y. radicals, he suggested, should perform tests on this population. \u201cWhy fight against the U.S. government when you can just, you know, fly a couple hours, and you don\u2019t have to fight against  any government?\u201d he said.\n Big Pharma makes a tempting target for some biohacking provocateurs. At the Biohack the Planet conference, a man named Gabriel Licina sat on the edge of the stage and gave a pugnacious talk about a project that he and two friends\u2014Andreas St\u00fcrmer, a biotechnologist in Austria, and David Ishee, an oil worker, self-taught biologist, and dog breeder in Mississippi\u2014had embarked on. They had, he announced, reverse engineered the gene-therapy drug Glybera, which treats a rare disease, called lipoprotein-lipase deficiency, that results in a dangerous buildup of triglycerides in the blood.\n Licina is famous in the biohacking community for a self-experiment he undertook in 2015, with eye drops of his own devising, to create \u201cnight vision.\u201d (The drops contained Chlorin e6, a light-sensitive substance similar to one found in sea creatures.)\u00a0If you Google his name, you\u2019ll discover photographs of him with his pupils dilated, his eyelids swollen, and his head shaved, looking like an extraterrestrial. He says that he saw farther at night for a few hours and suffered no lasting damage.\n  When the Dutch firm UniQure introduced Glybera, in 2015, it was the most expensive medication in the world, at about a million dollars a dose. Two years later, UniQure pulled Glybera from the market, because only one insurer, in Germany, would cover it\u2014for one patient. (Approximately one in a million people have lipoprotein-lipase deficiency.) In Las Vegas, Licina said that he and his colleagues had identified the relevant DNA, sent their findings to an outside genetics lab, and engineered  E.\u00a0coli to produce the protein that is missing in people who suffer from the disease. (The process is similar to how insulin is made.) Licina announced that he had brought forty vials of the modified bacteria to the conference, and he periodically waved one above his head, chuckling. He invited scientists to culture, purify, and test his creation. But, knowing his audience\u2019s penchant for self-experimentation, he said, \u201cDo  not inject yourself with this thing. For the love of God, stop stabbing yourselves.\u201d\n In February, I spoke to Licina on the phone. He was in South Bend, Indiana, where he runs a community lab, Scihouse, out of his home. \u201cThis is going to sound so flippant,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my friends and I decided to do the Glybera thing because we thought it would be  funny. I mean, this was a million-dollar drug.\u201d Yet even its secrets were unlocked with relative ease, he claimed. (UniQure, which retains a patent on the drug, said that it was blindsided by Licina\u2019s \u201cknockoff\u201d but has not sued.) Licina said that he doesn\u2019t want anyone to use his creation therapeutically. He just wanted biohackers like him to stop making glow-in-the-dark beer\u2014yes, that\u2019s a thing\u2014and focus their thrill-seeking minds on more substantive projects. He was pleased when two Stanford undergraduates, Alec Luiz Lourenco and Cooper Veit, volunteered to test his version of Glybera at a university lab. Lourenco and Veit are part of  , a student group that takes inspiration from the D.I.Y. movement and pursues what Lourenco calls \u201cindependent-type\u201d biological research. (The   project is pending, having been delayed by the pandemic shutdown.)\n In many ways, the earnest, democratizing amateurism of community labs feels nothing like the snarky, performative energy projected by biohackers. The people I spoke with at Open Insulin are modest, serious, and, in some cases, steeped in social-justice activism. Still, there is overlap between members of the two factions\u2014they know one another, attend some of the same conferences, and share a belief that real science can be conducted outside institutional settings. And they are similarly committed to making their protocols and findings transparent. One of Open Insulin\u2019s founders, Anthony Di Franco\u2014a computer scientist who lives in Berkeley and is himself a Type 1 diabetic\u2014told me that, though he thinks of Open Insulin as belonging to the \u201clineage of mutual-aid societies,\u201d he also sees the group as \u201cdefinitely part of the biohacking community.\u201d\n The D.I.Y.-bio movement first emerged in places where biotech was booming, like Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Bay Area. Some people who lacked the funding or the credentials required to work on biological research at the academic and corporate labs where it was being done began to equip themselves. Others wanted to demonstrate that high-level medical information and techniques  could be shared.

"note_en": "Joe Rogan, comedian and host of one of the most popular podcasts in the world, is taking his show to Spotify.  The Joe Rogan Experience will soon become  a Spotify exclusive, meaning episodes\u2019 full audio and video will only be available through the platform starting later this year. Up until now, Rogan\u2019s show has never been available on Spotify, let alone exclusive to any platform.\n The show will become available on Spotify globally starting on September 1st, and it\u2019ll become an exclusive sometime after that point. Listeners won\u2019t have to pay to access the episodes, but they will have to become Spotify users. Spotify said in a press release that Rogan retains creative control over his show. It didn\u2019t disclose how much it spent on the deal. The company will also work with an ad agency to jointly sell ads against the program. Rogan  said last year his show reached about 190 million downloads a month.\n Rogan\u2019s YouTube channel will remain live, but it won\u2019t contain full episodes. There might be clips or other supplementary content which could benefit from YouTube\u2019s search algorithm and push people to listen to full episodes on Spotify.\n  This is a massive get for Spotify, which has made podcasting a core focus. It acquired Gimlet Media, Anchor, and Parcast last year, to start, and then signed more Spotify-exclusive deals. It\u2019s working with  the Obamas\u2019 production company exclusively and committed to deals with other big names, like Joe Budden and Amy Schumer, and acquired The Ringer.\n Although exclusive deals seem to be the company\u2019s main listener acquisition strategy, Spotify didn\u2019t immediately move Gimlet shows to an exclusive model. Instead, it produced ancillary, exclusive content like  Gimlet Academy and extra  Reply All episodes while keeping existing shows widely available. In this case, the company will seemingly move relatively quickly to make Rogan a Spotify-only offering.\n  Spotify\u2019s podcast ambitions always directly targeted Apple, which, up until now, has been the biggest name in podcast players. But with the Rogan deal, Spotify also has another new target: YouTube. When it  began testing its video podcasting feature earlier this month, it did so with the backing of two popular YouTubers.
