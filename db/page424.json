To me, it&#39;s just techies doing techie things because they don&#39;t know what else to do.&#34;\n I haven&#39;t blogged about this because I thought it was obvious. But from the tweets and emails I have received, it seems not.\n This is a classic identification problem, and efficacy depends on two things: false positives and false negatives.\n False positives: Any app will have a precise definition of a contact: let&#39;s say it&#39;s less than six feet for more than ten minutes. The false positive rate is the percentage of contacts that don&#39;t result in transmissions. This will be because of several reasons. One, the app&#39;s location and proximity systems -- based on GPS and Bluetooth -- just aren&#39;t accurate enough to capture every contact. Two, the app won&#39;t be aware of any extenuating circumstances, like walls or  ...\n Assume you take the app out grocery shopping with you and it subsequently alerts you of a contact. What should you do? It&#39;s not accurate enough for you to quarantine yourself for two weeks. And without ubiquitous, cheap, fast, and accurate testing, you can&#39;t confirm the app&#39;s diagnosis. So the alert is useless.\n Similarly, assume you take the app out grocery shopping and it doesn&#39;t alert you of any contact. Are you in the clear? No, you&#39;re not. You actually have no idea if you&#39;ve been infected.\n The end result is an app that doesn&#39;t work. People will post their bad experiences on social media, and people will read those posts and realize that the app is not to be trusted. That loss of trust is even worse than having no app at all.\n It has nothing to do with privacy concerns. The idea that contact tracing can be done with an app, and not human health professionals, is just plain dumb.\n   Also, the biggest false negative: surface transmission. Someone coughs on a surface, and you touch it a minute later. You never went close to the person, and are not registered as a contact. Not that any kind of contact tracing can pick that stuff up.\n But not all techies are seduced by this - it got short shrift in this report, for instance:  https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/sites/default/files/atoms/files/covid-19_surveillance_roadmap_final.pdf - as well as Scott Gottleib, other authors have serious chops in Healthcare IT (e.g. Farzad)\n But a view from a different side: In the end, the only real tool we have is quarantine; the main question facing us is how to use it most efficiently, to maximise the cost/benefit balance. It&#39;s possible that the app will play a small role in that, though not in the simple way that you imagine, but more in giving people an estimate of the general viral load around them. It&#39;s not substitute for real contact tracing.\n or it can be left behind on a surface and picked up by someone later who was never in direct contact\n  the contact problem gets even worse if you take different living conditions into account. I&#39;m living in a house with multiple apartments. every morning I go to my workspace and sit there for 8h in front of my PC while working. my downstairs neighbor might do the same but I&#39;m pretty sure Bluetooth can&#39;t tell there&#39;s a floor between us and might count this as contact. I also have an upstairs neighbor...\n How is this specific to tracing apps? Or are you criticizing the whole idea of contact tracing to control epidemics?\n  Unfortunately it appears you haven&#39;t looked into this in enough detail, yet you&#39;re now being suddenly quoted everywhere (dangerous). Several erroneous assumptions: - Contact tracing by ONLY bluetooth will be implemented in the next updates of iOS and Android and won&#39;t require an app to function (just opt-in). That means the tracking capabilities will be available on about 80% of devices within 4-5 months on iOS. Less so on Android of course, but given the critical nature of this  ...\n At least you didn&#39;t rant about the privacy implications because, again, the new Contact Tracing APIs in Android and iOS have taken care of this as well. I would encourage you to review the information about these APIs and reconsider your post here before it&#39;s shared further.\n &#34;I&#39;m not even talking about the privacy concerns, I mean the efficacy. Does anybody think this will do something useful?\n I think it would be useful as the backbone of a subsequent traditional contact tracing investigation. I don&#39;t have perfect 14-day recall. I&#39;d prefer to have a 14-day place/contact report generated automatically the moment I contacted health professionals due to symptoms. The efficacy of the automated notifications is questionable but a &#34;trusted&#34; cross-platform OS level API for device proximity tracking seems reasonable and useful.\n the disease has some transmission rate that&#39;s less than 100% (and I don&#39;t know what that is).\n I&#39;mnot surprised, it&#39;s like trying to &#34;nail a buggy on a mule in the dark&#34; for several reasons. But two that are easy to see,\n 1, Even though  R 0 is an &#34;average&#34; it&#39;s for a moment in time, because it changes all the time, thus we have  R t when dealing with historic etc data (usually derived from a graph).\n 2, Like the Case Fataliry Rate (CFR) it&#39;s sensitive to it&#39;s inputs. Which in the case of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infection is very dificult to find out even remotely close without mass testing.\n  1, Let everyone get infected with attendant high mortality rates and getting an endemic infection with anything upto 1-6% of the worlds population dead.\n 2, Vacination, if one that is both safe and effective ever comes about (We still do not have vaccines four the four &#34;Seasonal CoV, or SARS-CoV-1)\n 3, Eradication, where the virus is robbed of hosts thus dies out and with a little luck becomes extinct. This can only be by effective &#34;Issolation&#34; not social distancing. Social distancing slows the spread it does not stop infections happening.\n As the first two are not realy options currently we are going for social distancing in the hope we can slow it enough so that healthcare has a chance to cut the death rate of the spreading infection.\n At some point social distancing is going to have to stop, because the economy will change beyond anything that would have been imagined half a year ago except by &#34;scare mongering scientists&#34;... And that sort of &#34;societal change&#34; an absolut anathema to the 1% of the 1% and other vested interests.\n      If anyone has any other ideas --and no I do not meen the idiotic &#34;herd immunity Policy&#34; carried out so disastrously in the UK etc-- then I for one would be delighted to hear about them.\n I&#39;m not an epidemiologist and may well be an idiot, but isn&#39;t this missing the point a bit? It&#39;s akin to not recommending that people wear masks on the basis that they only reduce the likelihood of transmission by a modest percentage rather than eliminating it (and yes, I know that there are also other reasons not to recommend wearing masks).\n Surely, even if an app correctly encourages only one out of every five or six vulnerable recipients to self-isolate or get tested when they wouldn&#39;t otherwise have done so, then the transmission rate is reduced, however minimally. The difference between a reproduction rate of 0.9 and 1.1 is the difference between a virus that eventually disappears in the local population and one that eventually infects almost everybody. This, in addition to other measures, still seems like quite an  ...\n Great post Bruce! But please correct the title from &#34;COVAD-19&#34; to &#34;COVID-19&#34; so it passes the most basic filters when sharing\n Richard is correct. If the contact tracing apps are billed as a complete solution, people will be disappointed. But that\u2019s not the intent; they\u2019re part of a suite of tools. They don\u2019t need to be 100% accurate to have a positive effect.\n Manual contract tracing has the exact same problems. You\u2019ll get false positives, because the virus doesn\u2019t pass to everyone you come in contact with. You\u2019ll also get false negatives, because you can\u2019t identify everyone you were close to. But manual contact tracing works, as evidenced by South Korea. There\u2019s no reason to think that good tracing apps can\u2019t be a valuable assist.\n The contact apps aren&#39;t to alert you when you are in proximity with someone who as COVID.\n They are to trace those who have been in proximity with someone who is diagnosed with COVID for sufficient time to have become possibly infected and to get them tested.\n If we weren&#39;t concerned with privacy, each individual phone user would be identified and would be required to be tested.\n But with privacy, and sufficient testing capacity, people can be notified anonymously that they were in proximity of someone positively diagnosed and they can decide whether to get tested.\n Depending on how many choose to do that, it will have at minimum, some positive impact in that more people will get tested. There is though, if the proximity detection is even partly useful, the possibility that more positive cases will be detected and people can quarantine and also be treated if needed earlier.\n That should reduce the health impact of COVID-19 and treatments are more likely to be useful in the early stages of infection.\n Hi, Bruce! I agree with your assessment of false positives/negatives but I disagree with the conclusions you draw.\n In a pandemic a single individual is not significant. What does matter, however, is the herd. There is a significant advantage to reducing the number of cases, even if some alerts are false positives or some cases go missing as false negatives.\n The alerts/testing does not have to work with 100% precision to be effective. Even with only a 50% success rate this would be a great success. Remember pandemics are all about exponential growth and 1/2^n would help reducing cases tremendously.\n I&#39;m not sure whether the terms of &#39;false positives&#39; and &#39;false negatives&#39; apply here. It is not a test. It is about creating a contact list. And yes, it will not be perfect.\n I think Richard and Clive hit my main points, but here is another three cents.\n    The argument that the bluetooth contact tracing is not reliable enough to influence behaviour. As Richard pointed out, it doesn&#39;t have to persuade everyone, just a few percent; *but also* it isn&#39;t a binary decision. Maybe someone doesn&#39;t go to a big event because he had a couple of alerts recently. Instead of being an asymptomatic mega spreader, he is just a regular spreader.\n The other main point I wanted to make is that contact tracing may not be as rigorous as human driven contact tracing, but it has other possibilities. 1. It can handle anonymous contacts ( transmission on a bus, anyone? and 2. You can go back in time! Not very far, for privacy reasons, but if you start getting warnings about contacts who weren&#39;t infection when you met them, time to test.\n Minor points. 20% in Singapore, yes they&#39;re law abiding and tend to trust the authorities, but this is a central government database system including location, which is a massive dis-incentive. It also ran as a regular app, so had to be foreground to work, and chewed battery.\n Without ubiquitous testing, this is of limited use. However, anything that helps target testing, will make testing so much more effective.\n The bluetooth contact information doesn&#39;t have to be used in isolation. Ask about symptoms, give it more weight, find downstream contacts getting sick, give it more weight.\n  Absent someone outing themselves as a professional active epidemiologist, we should be very careful about writing this off for reasons we&#39;re not sure of. I do know there was a lot of noise about how long the viral RNA can remain viable on a surface in a lab ( probably based on test from SARS-1 virus), but I&#39;m hearing a lot now about this not being a proven vector, and that the main transmission vector is probably direct.\n I&#39;m not sure you are barking up the right tree here. A contact tracing app is not an infection test and should not be mistaken as replacing one. It can however shorten the reaction time to identify a better subset of high risk individuals in the overall population that at all had the chance of being close enough for a possible infection over the previous 14 days the moment someone testes positive, so they can be tested as well and potential pre- or non-symptomatic infections  ...\n Richard and Bryant are correct, This was never meant to be a 100% purposeful solution. it was just yet another prosthetic to help us manage the problem.\n The validity of input data is also a concern - i.e. questionable due to significant rates of RT-PCR false negatives and false positives. Studies have demonstrated false negative rate of between 10 to 50%, with many experts agreeing on conservative a estimate of 20%. In Australia, TGA admits tests have not been subjected to standard validations due to the fast track approval process. If the testing accuracy is dubious, then this undermines the premise of the app. Australia hasn&#39;t  ...\n And without ubiquitous, cheap, fast, and accurate testing, you can&#39;t confirm the app&#39;s diagnosis. So the alert is useless.\n We&#39;re working on &#34;ubiquitous, cheap, fast, and accurate testing,&#34;; will you revise your post once it&#39;s there? It already is there in a bunch of countries; are apps not useful there?\n The idea is not to have only apps, but to warn people who are at increased risk to nudge them towards getting tested. Contact tracing by hand worked remarkably well in many places; the apps are supposed to aid with that.\n  &gt; 2, Vacination, if one that is both safe and effective ever comes about (We still do not have vaccines four the four &#34;Seasonal CoV, or SARS-CoV-1)\n Well, no, but as Derek Lowe has pointed out, that&#39;s mostly because nobody&#39;s bothered. SARS-CoV-1 is extinct, and it&#39;s a bit hard to test a vaccine when you have no pathogen to test it against: the SARS-CoV-1 vaccines-under-development appear to have activity against SARS-CoV-2 as well, so that&#39;s givign them a head start. As for the other human coronaviruses... all put together, they cause perhaps 15% of human colds. So a vaccine against one would cure about 25%  ...\n SARS-CoV-2 is not like that. There&#39;s only one of it, it&#39;s not very diverse (it hasn&#39;t had time, even if it didn&#39;t also have a proofreader keeping the mutation rate down), and nobody has prior exposure. A vaccine is *definitely* worthwhile.\n I think you misunderstood one very important point: If you get a warning from the app that you have been in contact with someone you shouldn \u2019t quarantine for two weeks. You should limit your contacts for the next 72h and behave as \u201epotentially infected \u201cin a reasonable way and quarantine in case you get the slightest symptoms. So really wear mask, really don \u2019t see others and really be careful with your hand hygiene. The advantage of the app will be the time to know that you  ...\n The purpose of these contact apps - regardless of design and technique - is to suggest who should be tested next. Your scenario is not in use, these apps won&#39;t ever be able to tell you if you are a &#34;positive&#34; or &#34;negative&#34;.\n So there are no false negatives or positives at all - false positives will disappear when tested, and the only disadvantage they bring is loss of the limited test supply. False negatives should not - if they follow the social distancing rules - infect other people and will show up eventually when feeling sick.\n If testing supply is sufficient, you increase the amount of physical tests to minimze the amount of false negatives (if you&#39;ve ever been in range of an infected person you will be send to a test).\n In real world conditions now somewhere between one in a hundred or one per ten thousand persons you meet is infected, depending on location. So an app - even if done badly, distributed only to some people and not working all the time may still help to create a waiting-to-be-tested line that works better than random testing.\n In a perfcet world you simply test everyone 4 times in two weeks and you&#39;re done.\n @Tyler - can you provide any more details on three levels of proximity sensing? AFAIK, South Korea had to run a battery of device calibrations in order to compensate for the different broadcasting power levels of different phones/chips; from this I conclude that Bluetooth is not a good tool to measure distances to other devices. Please explain why that is incorrect.\n Also, I would like to comment on the &#34;something is better than nothing&#34; idea: if the app reports contact with someone tested positive for Covid-19, what happens next? With a decentralized, anonymous system, it is all up to the individual. If they all run and ask for a test, the testing system might not be able to cope given too many false positives. Even if they get a test, after a few times of having a negative test despite being alerted by the app, people will stop  ...\n And at this very moment in Europe, people with severe symptoms are still not being admitted to a proper test unless they have been in contact with someone known to be positive - so there seems a very strong need to keep the testing numbers low. Adding millions of app users will not help on that. And the app will NOT help any of the official contact tracing, as officials have not access to any useful data, even if you hand over your phone. All they get are random numbers  ...\n And finally: Once such an app is in place there is a clear danger the app will become &#34;mandatory&#34;, e.g. for admission to certain places (&#34;show me your app or I will not let you in&#34;).\n I think Stefan and Tyler both make good points - this is not a replacement for a medical test, and it isn&#39;t for now. It&#39;s about identifying higher risk individuals in the future.\n Can a phone tell if you&#39;ve been infected by Covid-19? Of course not. But it can give you some degree of warning if you&#39;re at higher risk due to past proximity with someone who has tested positive. Nothing replaces proper testing, though.\n You also assert &#34;It&#39;s not accurate enough for you to quarantine yourself for two weeks&#34;. I&#39;m afraid I take issue with this; that rather depends on your criteria for going into quarantine.\n - If you will only quarantine if you are proven sick, then yeah, it does nothing for you - *yet*. Testing is being scaled up in many countries, and in the future (while we&#39;re still dealing with this) having a warning might be a prompt to get tested and act based on it&#39;s result.\n - If you will quarantine if you&#39;ve had a warning - or perhaps a number of warnings - as you see it as your duty to prevent transmission even though you may or may not be infected, then maybe it&#39;s good enough now. Testing can catch up in time.\n The problem of false negatives - of contacts not being recorded - is not a problem in itself because that&#39;s the world we already live in. My concern, though, would be that people start to rely on the app, rather than continuing to keep their distance, wash their hands, and not touching their face.\n On problem of contact tracing (regardless of centralized or not) with Bluetooth or similar technology is that a malicious attacker with specialized radio equipment (think 500 meter instead of 5m, and think wardriving with radio signals from outside to inside a building) can make any group of people falsely believe that they are infected.\n For example, someone might just drive by a parliament building and send the members of parliament into voluntary home quarantine. This is possible with Bluetooth Beacons.\n Is my understanding correct? Let&#39;s say I own a restaurant and I want to shut down my competitor&#39;s restaurant. Or let&#39;s say I am a teenage kid and want to shut down my school. Or, let&#39;s say I am a US democrat and want to hurt the political activities of the republican party.\n I really don&#39;t know since I am not an expert, but I am wondering if such apps should be widely used.\n There is ways around every problem, i wonder why professionals are so quick to dismiss ideas completely because of minor hurdles..\n First of all you can definde logical sectors. You research in what possbile locations infection typically takes place. Then you can give an &#34;ID&#34; to these locations. (I dont want to go into technicals but for example QR Codes at store entrances and busses)\n Even if you only trace all public locations somebody has been to you have gained a lot.\n Another way to segment the problem is to use different modes, for home, outside, work etc.\n The limited testing capatibilities are exactly why an app would be helpful. You would know where to look without &#34;testing around&#34; cases.\n Of course there is other problems but there is also other solutions. You could develop cheap blue tooth transponders for rooms and vehicles for example.\n RE: &#34;My problem with contact tracing apps is that they have absolutely no value.&#34; Not true: they can improve reaction time, assuming the tools are use appropriately.\n  RE: &#34;To me, it&#39;s just techies doing techie things.&#34; Absolutely. This is a common problem: Americans in general, and techies in particular,  lovetechnical solutions, even if they don&#39;t make sense.\n  Alternative: If you want to avoid the issues in tracing and stop the spread of the disease, there is a simple, cost effective solution: 1. Assume that everyone outside your home is a potential carrier. 2. Assume that every surface you touch is potentially contaminated. (The only exception is a surface that you cleaned yourself -- recently.)\n Keep your distance. Wear a mask. Encourage others to wear one. If you touch an object or surface, wash your hands. You don&#39;t wait for an app to tell you that you might have been exposed. You don&#39;t rely on the person to self-isolate based on the app.\n One of the first rules of gun safety is this: assume that all guns are loaded. The only exception is a gun that you have unloaded yourself. Treat every gun that you handle as if it is loaded -- always. If you treat it with respect, you&#39;ll never have to say, &#34;I&#39;m sorry: I didn&#39;t know it was loaded.&#34;\n [My background in college was microbiology and biochemistry. I spent most of my early career working with scientists, where I regularly encountered hazardous materials.]\n The money spent on these dragnets for people&#39;s relationships (or better fascists&#39; wet dream) should better be spent by minifying surface conterminations and raising the sanitizing in the public space.\n Like: - having soap and sterilium dispensers in each and every public building, schools or toilet FOR FREE, and MQTT-driven &#34;refill needed&#34; and &#34;cleaning needed&#34; foot or ellbow operated buttons. AMZN should have a few from their shelved dash button project.\n  - changing the door opening programs for public means of transportation to open alway all doors to maximize air change and minimize door handle usage.\n    - use multilingual speech recognition in elevators (where you could for example say 5th floor, f\u00fcnfter stock, or the name of any tennant in the 5th floor)\n - also rotating heat exchangers with moisture/enthalpy recovery in modern skyscrapers should be a big no-no sanitationwise.\n One further problem I see (which could be included in the &#34;false&#34; positive area) is false assumptions, of where everybody has a smart phone, and where there&#39;s a permanent 1:1 relationship between the user and the technology. This is very much in the vein of &#34;you are your phone&#34; that&#39;s presumed with things like payment systems.\n This is a real blind spot for the people who advocate this kind of application of technology, including the people who are advocating for online voting. For people who live in that kind of environment, where they are never without their phones, and have apps for everything, COVID tracking, voting, purchasing, multi-factor authentication, and nearly anything else is just another app.\n However, there are plenty of people out there that don&#39;t use their phones that way. There&#39;s still lots of feature phones out there, that don&#39;t have the capacities of a smart phone, including ones that don&#39;t support wi-fi or LTE (or GPS). And there&#39;s also plenty of places where people may share phones. Plus, the issues of people who are in areas (often, but not always, ru\n For the technically adept who live on their smartphones, it&#39;s easy to dismiss the people who don&#39;t have similar technology and usage patterns as Luddites that &#34;can&#39;t get with the program&#34;, but like it or not, that kind of usage is far from universal, and widespread enough that I think the kind of monitoring proposed will have significant (and likely fatal) gaps in coverage.\n I&#39;m unconvinced that this is a problem that can be solved with this application of this technology.\n Assume you take the app out grocery shopping with you and it subsequently alerts you of a contact. What should you do? It&#39;s not accurate enough for you to quarantine yourself for two weeks. And without ubiquitous, cheap, fast, and accurate testing, you can&#39;t confirm the app&#39;s diagnosis. So the alert is useless.\n If you assume that all the app does is say &#34;you had a contact&#34;, then yes, in the absence of easy testing, it&#39;ll quickly feel pointless to people.\n But what if, on the other hand, the app says something like: &#34;Your phone registered proximity to someone who&#39;s known to be infected, at [this time], for [this long]. Please answer a few questions:  - Were you around other people, or by yourself?  - Were you wearing a mask?  - Did you spend time within 6 feet of anyone who was not wearing a mask?&#34;\n  Given this, the app could help the user make a reasonable decision about their risk level; should they seek a test, or isolate at home?\n If we&#39;re concerned about too many false positives, the multipliers can be brought down, so for example, brief encounters are low risk, and if you say you were wearing a mask, it&#39;s listed as very low risk. But there will still be cases where this kind of app gives you value, especially after we&#39;ve opened up a lot; for example, if you&#39;re in a coffee shop without a mask for 2 hours, and then you later get an alert that someone infected was near you  ...\n There are ongoing studies right now to verify the efficacy of contact tracing apps, and whether the contacts they register are inline with what we would consider &#34;dangerous&#34; contacts with a reasonably high probability of transmission (e.g. by EPFL in Switzerland). Maybe we should all calm down and wait for the results before we start yelling at each other, and making arguments based on on intuition and &#34;common sense.&#34;\n (Also, just to point that out as well, these apps don&#39;t have to be perfect. It&#39;s totally fine for them to have a high percentage of false positives and false negatives, as long as they overall have a measurable positive impact on the reproduction number. And since small changes in the reproduction number can have large effects, even an app that only works somewhat poorly could still make the difference between an infection getting out of hand, and being contained.)  ...\n One final point: many of these apps do not work in the way you think they work, and can not be used to track people&#39;s behavior. Might be worth looking into actual proposals for how these apps will work instead of calling people fascists without any evidence.\n My view of these tracking apps seems to be somewhat different than the ones posted above. Even if there are tech problems with the apps; even if a lot of folks will not pay attention to the results; even if there are multitudes of false positive/negative results; if even one human life is saved, then it will benefit the future.\n Imagine that if one life saved is the future parent or grand-parent of the next Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, Jonas Salk, or Richard Feynman.\n Assume you take the app out grocery shopping with you and it subsequently alerts you of a contact. What should you do? It&#39;s not accurate enough for you to quarantine yourself for two weeks.\n Whether or not it&#39;s accurate, one might be concerned that the government would find out and order a quarantine. This is one of many reasons why people may avoid using the app (even if they have the technical capability to run it) which could make the false-negatives a self-reinforcing problem.\n If you can get clusters of people to use it, say everyone in a big office building, it&#39;s a lot easier to hit that 20-60% number than in the population as a whole.\n IMO these apps will be most useful as a tool to assist manual contact tracing teams at first.\n That&#39;s an overly simplistic analysis, that among other things only considers gross benefit rather than net benefit. I could just as easily say that the mental effects of pervasive surveillance could make &#34;the next Einstein&#34; turn away from physics. Maybe we&#39;d bring a deadly anti-government revolution into existence. These are all wild-ass guesses. Setting social policy based on evidenceless predictions is a fool&#39;s errand.\n Any &#34;if it only saves one life&#34; argument ignores the fact that there are trade-offs in all things. Everything has a cost and, scaled up to the world, it&#39;s not uncommon that that cost is greater than one life.\n Our rulers have been telling us nonstop for weeks that SARS-CoV-2 is so contagious that you can get it just from walking past someone on the sidewalk, and now we&#39;re all supposed to use &#34;contact tracing&#34; apps? Just who do they think they&#39;re kidding?\n This isn&#39;t a virus, it&#39;s a plot device in a badly written movie that does whatever the writer needs it to from one scene to the next without regard for logic or continuity.\n My understanding, is that the concept of &#34;contact tracing apps&#34; is not to  replace trained contact tracers, but rather to increase the amount of work they can accomplish in each day.\n  Perhaps at least one Asian country has already tried it, and the world can learn from their experience.\n I see that while I was editing this, Dan G made the same point more succinctly :)\n  Although there has been very much discussion of the possibility of transmission via surfaces, doctors just aren&#39;t seeing it. It appears (from real-life tracing of how people became infected) that almost all transmissions are to people who were within 2 meters of an infected person for more than 10 or 15 minutes.\n No technique will catch 100% of anything. That&#39;s not necessary, for it to be useful.\n    Some countries may achieve eradication within their borders ... but until vaccine eradication becomes possible, they would have to keep their travel barriers up high, and pay the price for that, permanently.\n Even with such barriers in place, these countries will have the reality that leakage can&#39;t reliably be forced to zero, and therefore be ready with Test/Trace/Isolate responses whenever a new case appears.\n Might be worth looking into actual proposals for how these apps will work instead of calling people fascists without any evidence. I called nobody a fascist. I called the system a fascist&#39;s wet dream.\n Somebody creates a system with the best intentions. Governments changes, systems stay, rules change... what do you do, if the next government misuses your system?\n And it will be misused at some point in time, because a pile of data invites misuse - just like trash attracts rats and left over french fires attracts raccoons. The best way ist to not collect possibly dangerous data at all.\n I showed up ways to lower the reproduction number of COVID-19 (and by the way other viruses and bacteria in the same effort). More sustainable, broader in effect, even accessible to people without smartphones, money, lobby and support (the working poor, and the really poor - these have been the substrate on which COVID19 grew in Singapore).\n With each and every such data collection system (and set of laws coming with it), please ask yourself: what could the next (possibly dystropean, stupid, extremist) government or junta do with it, should the country fails, elects an extremist party, breaks apart in a civil war, etc?\n If you introduce a situation where somebody can say &#34;the system said so&#34; and confine or even deport you &#34;for medical reasons&#34; *and everybody copes with it*, the temptation to just emulate &#34;is infected&#34;-events to get rid of &#34;the other side&#34; will grow fast. Not even the workers for this system would know that they deport or confine for political reasons, they just do their work.\n Maybe you should read up about the first &#34;big data&#34; application (made with punch cards and hollerith machines back in the day): the field &#34;religion&#34; in the dutch census database before 1933. Introduced with the best intentions (to calculate church taxes correctly and fast) the occupying germans said thank you, and used this information to pick up and deport the jews. Greetings from Anne F.\n Now sit down and make a list of what can be done under the worst circumstances with your proposed system and all data in it if NOT in the hands of St Lucas and used for the greater good of all human beings, but in the greedy claws of Kim Abu Adolpho Jean-Bedel al-Teherani from Somedistantholestan, if he wishes to divide and opress his subordinates.\n I&#39;m not sure whether the terms of &#39;false positives&#39; and &#39;false negatives&#39; apply here. It is not a test. It is about creating a contact list. And yes, it will not be perfect\n  Anyone who wants to understand the purpose of such tools, can consider the real-life example of crime investigators looking at the telephone records of a suspect.\n Will all of the calls on the phone log be related to the crime? Well duh, no! Of course not.\n Could there have been other conversations related to the crime that don&#39;t show in the phone log? Well duh, yeah! Of course.\n Despite these limitations, review of phone logs has enabled investigators to exclude or confirm suspects. It&#39;s a data source, NOT a diagnostic.\n False positives: Any app will have a precise definition of a contact: let&#39;s say it&#39;s less than six feet for more than ten minutes.\n They&#39;re Mormons. Caffeinated beverages are a sin. You&#39;re considered &#34;engaged&#34; if you stop to have a 10-minute conversation with some guy at a coffee shop. You&#39;re then obligated to have sex with him and make it right in the eyes of God. Those men are very suave, wear a certain kind of underwear, and maintain certain very proper and old-fashioned protocols and expectations of appropriate &#34;social distancing&#34; for a man&#39;s soon-to-be-carnal  ...\n This is a &#39;dumb&#39; take. The idea that contact tracing can be done with &#34;human health professionals&#34; is &#34;just plain dumb&#34;. The performance of human health professionals will also result in false positives and false negatives. What&#39;s the evidence that those rates are significantly better than an app?\n The smart take would realize that the choice isn&#39;t  betweenapps and &#39;professionals&#39; \u2013they could and should be used together. Without an app like what&#39;s being discussed, how would any professionals be able to trace a person&#39;s contacts, e.g. at a grocery store? Maybe the transmission of some other disease could be traced by, e.g. reviewing security camera videos at a number of stores, but this disease doesn&#39;t seem likely to be contained  ...\n The better way to interpret  any contact tracing, either by app or &#39;professional&#39;, is not as a binary &#39;infected&#39; or &#39;not infected&#39; judgement but as  evidenceto be weighed by such factors as false positives, false negatives, or other (approximately) measured biases in the different procedures. Yes, there would almost certainly be some threshold that, when exceeded, any contact tracing operation would suggest (or demand) that a person  ...\n Also, the idea that contact tracing could be performed, &#39;at scale&#39;, by what someone might reasonably consider to be a &#34;human health professional&#34; is also &#34;just plain dumb&#34;. The people likely to be involved in any large scale contact tracing effort are almost certainly not going to be doctors or nurses to any significant extent. They might be &#39;professionals&#39; because they&#39;re being paid but they&#39;re only &#39;health  ...\n I agree with Bruce on this. All the arguments that &#34;it doesn&#39;t need be perfect&#34;, and &#34;contact tracing app is a positive contribution even if only helps track down a small number of cases&#34;, miss the point.\n The true positive results will be drowned in false positives, which will divert precious resources into conducting useless activities, and creating unneeded stress in people.\n It will also lull people into a false sense of safety. &#34;Oh, the techies are looking out for us, we&#39;re good&#34;. And so there will be false negatives that could have been prevented or detected through more serious means.\n There are some food for thought videos on this site, unpacking \u201cR\u201d into causal factors, discussing transmissibility in terms of a statistical population of values rather than a point value, and referencing realistic models (e.g. modeling portal MIDAS.)\n The idea behind the APP is that you have ubiquitous, cheap, fast, and accurate testing. But App or not, we need massive testing to get back to or near to normal again.   https://paulromer.net/\n  The numbers don&#39;t add up for mathematical modeling on YouTube. AMS is too much the gentleman&#39;s club, and there are too many fashion models on the premises.\n Do you mean to include Australia? The Commonwealth Government sat on its hands in Jan, Feb and half way through March. It allowed thousands of infected people to come from overseas straight into the community.\n The social distancing rules and business closures have been imposed by the State Governments. States have closed their borders to other States. Contact tracing and testing has been done by the States.\n  This seems calculated to convince the community to live with the virus. Lots of copies have been downloaded. It beats me why people have so much faith in computer systems.\n My understanding is that the Prime Minister of the other antipodean nation to which you may be referring, New Zealand, did state an intention to eradicate the virus.\n I can see your assertion that what is required is tracking, tracing, testing and confining. However in my view a clear aim should also be stated, perhaps:\n  Communities should demand that their Governments ensure that each infected person infect on average less than one other person.\n Modern infectious diseases like coronavirus are the consequence of industrial civilization: technical developments enable the high density populations of modern cities and the ability for rapid mass travel.\n  If we look at the efficiency of modern medicine, it is in rapid decline because many of the innovations that allowed us to get here are over 100 years old: sanitation and hygeine (Ignaz Semmelweiss), painkillers and anesthetics, antibiotics (developed for about $40,000 in basic science research), and the vaccine.\n  Modern medicine -- like any industrial enterprise -- is characterized by diminishing returns. In this context, to expect technology to save us from coronavirus is not rational. There are no technical solutions to the problems caused by too much technology.\n The solutions here are in the policy realm: a comprehensive system of social insurance so that the sick can get treated and national resources can be rapidly mobilized in an emergency; and, alongside this, a guaranteed minimum income so that those who are ill can stay at home without risking infecting others but can maintain their ability to participate in the economy.\n A starting point for the latter policy direction might be John Kenneth Galbraith&#39;s &#34;cyclically graduated compensation,&#34; which ties unemployment benefits to the unemployment rate. When unemployment is low, benefits are just enough to get by; when unemployment is high, benefits are competitive with wages. This eliminates the incentive to idleness and prevents recessions from driving down wages, all while preserving aggregate demand  ...\n It&#39;s voluntary to carry the app, then when it informs of a possible contact it&#39;s voluntary to get tested. Excuse me, what&#39;s the point? Just so Silicon Valley can be seen to be doing something, anything\u2026\n The ugly point hidden so far is the monetization. It&#39;s beyond belief this app is given away in altruism.\n Maybe voluntary in one direction. If a test is what I wanted, it wouldn&#39;t be so easy to volunteer. My city has one testing center, a 4 hour walk from me, and if I thought I could walk or bike that distance there&#39;d be no reason to. It wouldn&#39;t exactly be a great idea to take a bus or taxi there. If I solved that problem, I still wouldn&#39;t be able to be tested, because it&#39;s only open to critical workers and their families, people  ...\n The tests need to be abundant and  accessible. These app makers would do more good by making an app that helped get people to tests, or tests to people. Health officials all praise testing, but much of the world seem to be dragging their feet on it. Stories abound of people who maybe once had COVID and don&#39;t expect to ever know.\n Contact tracking apps can be viewed as crude virus infection proxies. They imitate (with some degree of fidelity) the spreading mechanism of a generic virus.\n They proxy only the physical locality aspect of a virus infection opportunity. All other aspects are treated as if they were operating at 100% effectiveness.\n If widely enough adopted, they might provide insight into how the population is really interacting with itself. This in turn used with recorded cases and fatalities might help estimate the unknow infection rate.\n When infections are on the rise, we currently need to put 100% of the population into lockdown, i.e. a light to moderate quarantine. A widely used contact tracing app would allow us to only put those into quarantine who have had exposure. We might achieve half the efficacy of a total lockdown by merely quarantining 5% of the population. The rate of false positives hardly matters for this use-case, in some situations 99.9% could be acceptable.  ...\n Like brute forcing a password each char is exponential, a computer can do it but manual testing can&#39;t, you need 95% accurate tests.\n Probably pointless when you don&#39;t give your citizens proper welfare or source of income to be able to hunker down, they are going to revolt, or have to queue for food etc.\n The arguments about surface transmission, it&#39;s purely how well behaved your population is, social distancing and hand hygiene works. All you are doing with this argument is saying we&#39;ll all suffer the lowest common denominator.\n &#34;you can&#39;t expect people to isolate for 2 weeks if they get a false positive&#34; - social distancing and hygiene applies to households, households with positive cases still have family members living in them that are not catching it with proper protocols.\n So yes, it&#39;s easily defeated, but where you have a good uptake of proper behavior, where contact tracing and hygiene has already been successful, it makes that process much more thorough and faster if there is any more outbreaks of community transmission. Every contact will be tested.\n The wild card at the end of any theory is peoples behavior and the ugly truth is that&#39;s why some countries are doing better than others.\n Chinese Researchers fitst pointed out that something like 6% of those infected do not &#34;seroconvert&#34; (produce antibodies).\n The WHO later warned of this but frustratingly just said &#34;many&#34; not a range of percentages.\n But it&#39;s not just the seroconvertion issue, others are starting to say that in some the antibodies die back quickly --as little as two-four weeks, hence they can be reinfected in a very short time.\n Others think that the virus might hide in the body out of the circulatory system where our blood tests will not spot it. Thus it can come back with a vengence if those people are subject to stress.\n Such issues is confirmed by research could make a nonsense of &#34;back to work testing&#34;...\n But there are issues as I&#39;ve pointed out to @Jane and @C above, but there is more peculiarities being detected.\n There is a paper that I&#39;ve yet to read in depth done in the UK that has a cohort of ~16k patients, that tested positive in the UK, which is about a third of the total recorded cases at the time.\n Off the top of my head 14% did not progress to hospital, of those that did something like 30% died.\n But more intetestingly of those in hospital who died ~60% were men. But only about half of those in hospital had recognisable comorbidities.\n Those that were hospitalised tended to &#34;group&#34; that is they shared symptoms with others but not others.\n This suggests there are &#34;types&#34; of infection or patient. Which is which is unclear currently, but this raises the flag that there might not be a &#34;one size fits all&#34; vaccine. Which effects not just efficacy but safety as well. That is a vaccine that is safe for one type might be quite unsafe for another group.\n I would like to interject a question of practicality into this very interesting discussion of opinion and theory. Earlier this week, Apple began rolling out a beta of iOS 13.5 that includes the Covid-19 Tracking capability, with the default being &#34;On&#34;, located under Settings/Privacy/Health.  Does this mean someones iPhone running iOS 13.5 Beta is now collecting and reporting contact information to Apple, or does this mean the feature  ...\n There is , i wonder why professionals are so quick to dismiss ideas completely because of minor hurdles..\n No there are not ways around every problem, you would know that if you have been a practicing professional engineer for any period of time.\n Your first limitvand theres nothing you can do about this is &#34;the laws of physics&#34;.\n This leads into another issue even when the laws of physics do alow it, existing systems may not be designed for such solutions to be possible.\n Which leads into another issue &#34;work factor -v- Power Consumption&#34; if the solution cuts battery life down to only an hour or two a day, people are either not going to carry their phone because it&#39;s on charge all the time or they are going to turn the phone off.\n Which leads into another issue, the application may well be a resource hog this slow other applications on a phone down to a crawl.\n But there is another issue are all phones going to be able to run both Bluetooth and WiFi, they do share the frequency spectrum so what was once usable WiFi gets jamed by all those bluetooth emiting phones...\n There are a number of other just technical not security issues but the above should make you realise that there is NOT &#34;ways around every problem&#34;, and they are NOT &#34;minor hurdles&#34;.\n  To me, it&#39;s just techies doing techie things because they don&#39;t know what else to do.\n  Like so many other &#34;techies&#34; they have little or no clue what they are doing, because their love of technology and thinking they look clever is a Dunning-Kruger problem. Of which we have hundreds of thousands of examples with the likes of IoT and many &#34;start up gizmos&#34; all going wrong at the simple technical levels, let alone the security levels that very very few have any experience what so ever.\n  We&#39;re putting millions of people into effective quarantine today. Even if this app has a rate of 50% false positives and we end up putting hundreds of thousands people into quarantine wrongfully it&#39;s a huge win for society overall.\n One final point: many of these apps do not work in the way you think they work, and can not be used to track people&#39;s behavior.\n  The location of your phone is known to many people and both the IC and LEO&#39;s can get it either by just &#34;snooping on the backbone&#34; or poping around with an NSL etc.\n  I just wish people would take this fact on board because it might tell you why some LEO&#39;s are going to have wet dreams over this technology.\n But it gets worse your phone has no idea if it&#39;s recording another mobile phone or a &#34;fixed position beacon&#34;. This alows your phone position to be worked out fairky accurately especially if the accelerometers in the phone are also enabled.\n But it gets worse if a Government insists that the DB&#39;s are stored centrally (France for instance) or accessable centrally than any anonymity in the system can be fairly easily unrolled...\n And these are just one or two of the more easily seen flaws in the system, there are others and no doubt many more will be found with the Standards, Protocols and Implementations.\n  Perfection is the enemy of good. The system isn\u2019t perfect but it is valuable.\n Your phone alerts you that someone you spent 18 minutes with at a coffee shop has tested positive. It recommends that you watch for symptoms and get tested.\n  A false negative is more risky because it may lead to a false sense of security as people go out convinced they don\u2019t have coronavirus. But they would do that anyway without the app.\n Other considerations aside, if this application requires electricity to work, that could be a show-stopper on Iphone, at least my Iphone. \ud83d\ude09\n An official with a Canadian public health authority I questioned said in manual contact tracing they are only interested in people who had CLOSE and PROLONGED contact with an infected person. So, I conclude, there&#39;s no need for an app to, say, collect the numbers of people you walk by on the street on in a supermarket. Also remember that manual tracing -- like an app -- only covers who you are in contact with, not what you touch.\n I have a better idea: make it a feature of Pok\u00e9mon. Ten million people will download it the first day, no questions asked.\n Contact tracing has a long history for STDs. STDs also have a medical solution. And for STDs the notion of a contact is nicely bounded.\n This bugger virus is not understood. It is interesting for an application to present a spaghetti map for others to map to if and only if the known positive Is in your cached weeks of stranger IDs matches.\n A virus transfer would look like any other interaction: hello Bob, drug sale, drug purchase, bum a cigarette, ask for directions, Time and space will have to be fuzzy for surface contact viral transfers.\n  The obvious is a test me notification icon. The number of triggered contacts is likely to be 20-200 times the number of positive tests. USA new cases yesterday 36,000 so ball park one million tests triggered a day.\n Speaking of ball park... model contact dynamics reported by such an application at a baseball or basketball game.\n Your phone alerts you that someone you spent 18 minutes with at a coffee shop has tested positive\n  Contact tracing has a long history for STDs. STDs also have a medical solution. And for STDs the notion of a contact is nicely bounded.\n Officially top secret, but an open secret, no doubt. The suave gentleman at the coffee shop, a.k.a. &#34;that guy,&#34; is simply  too entitled.\n Bread is said to leaven in 18 minutes, according to some of those Jewish rabbis.\n There was a certain worldly &#34;way of life&#34; at some of those coffee shops, which is no more, and cannot be.\n Social conversation cannot possibly spread disease more than mere physical proximity without the conversation and socialization.\n There is something more going on. It is the false expectation and assumption of more intimate contact at night to follow any sort of open conversation or talk by day.\n That&#39;s the Asian Yin\u2013Yang. There are Asian triads and wiseguys who rule the night life of the city in a strange and inconsistent reflection of day life.\n about your sentence: &#34;To me, it&#39;s just techies doing techie things because they don&#39;t know what else to do.&#34; I&#39;d have added &#34;to defeat the virus&#34; in the end.  Instead for other purposes at least some governments will enjoy to look into collected data.  https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/493\n   Allowed HTML: &lt;a href=&#34;URL&#34;&gt; \u2022 &lt;em&gt; &lt;cite&gt; &lt;i&gt; \u2022 &lt;strong&gt; &lt;b&gt; \u2022 &lt;sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt; \u2022 &lt;ul&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; \u2022 &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;pre&gt;", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:30", "tags": "\u7a0b\u5e8f,\u75c5\u6bd2,app,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,tracing", "title": "\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u63a5\u89e6\u8005\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f", "title_en": "Me on Covid-19 contact tracing apps", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/05/me_on_covad-19_.html", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u7a0b\u5e8f", "\u75c5\u6bd2", "app", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "tracing"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000304, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u53cc\u5b50\u5ea7\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5b83\u63a2\u7d22\u5730\u9f20\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u52aa\u529b\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u7684(\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u7684)\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u7684(\u4e0d\u53ef\u5426\u8ba4\u7684)\u9677\u9631\u3002\n\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6258\u7ba1Gemini\u7684\u5b98\u65b9\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u90a3\u4e9b\u60f3\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u4e2a\u4ebaGminispace(\u901a\u8fc7sftp\u7ba1\u7406)\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7edd\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5b50\u5ea7\u672c\u8eab\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u624d\u80fd\u8bbf\u95ee\u5b83\u3002\n\u5c11\u91cf\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5185\u5bb9\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u9762\u7684HTTPS\u6216\u901a\u8fc7Gopher\u83b7\u5f97\u3002", "note_en": "Gemini is a new, collaboratively designed internet protocol, which explores the space inbetween gopher and the web, striving to address (perceived) limitations of one while avoiding the (undeniable) pitfalls of the other.\n This server hosts the official specification and other documentation for Gemini, as well as offering free personal Geminispace (managed via  sftp) for those wanting to play with the protocol.

"note_en": "Java SE 13 (Sept 2019) introduced text blocks as a preview feature, aimed at reducing the pain of declaring and using multi-line string literals in Java. It was subsequently refined in a second preview, with minor changes, and is scheduled to become a permanent feature of the Java Language in Java SE 15(Sept 2020).\n  String literals in Java programs are not limited to short strings like &#34;yes&#34; and &#34;no&#34;; they often correspond to entire &#34;programs&#34; in structured languages such as HTML, SQL, XML, JSON, or even Java.\n  Text blocks are string literals that can comprise multiple lines of text\u00a0and uses triple quotes (&#34;&#34;&#34;) as its opening and closing delimiter.\n  A text block can be thought of as a  two dimensional\u00a0block of text embedded in a Java program.\n  Being able to preserve the two-dimensional structure of that embedded program, without having to muck it up with escape characters and other linguistic intrusions, is less error-prone and results in more readable programs.\n   In  Java Futures at QCon New York, Java Language Architect Brian Goetz took us on a whirlwind tour of some of the recent and future features in the Java Language. In this article, he dives into Text Blocks.\n Java SE 13 (Sept 2019) introduced   text blocks as a  preview feature, aimed at reducing the pain of declaring and using multi-line string literals in Java.\n  It was subsequently refined in a  second preview, with minor changes, and is scheduled to become a  permanent feature of the Java Language in Java SE 15(Sept 2020).\n Text blocks are string literals that can comprise multiple lines of text. A text block looks like:\n  In this simple example, the variable  address will contain a two-line string, with line terminators after each line. Without text blocks, we would have to have written:\n String address = &#34;25 Main Street\\n&#34; + &#34;Anytown, USA, 12345\\n&#34;;orString address = &#34;25 Main Street\\nAnytown, USA, 12345\\n&#34;;\n As every Java developer already knows, these alternatives are cumbersome to write. But, more importantly, they are also more  error-prone (it&#39;s easy to forget a  \\n and not realize it), and more  difficult to read(because the language syntax is intermixed with the contents of the string). Since a text block is usually free of escape characters and other linguistic interruptions, it lets the language get out of the way so it is easier for readers to see the contents of the  ...\n The most commonly escaped character in string literals is newline ( \\n), and text blocks eliminate the need for these by allowing multi-line strings to be expressed directly. After newline, the next most commonly escaped character is double quote ( \\&#34;), which must be escaped because it conflicts with the string literal delimiter. Text blocks eliminate the need for these as well, because a single quote does not conflict with the triple-quote text block delimiter.\n  One might think that this feature would have been called &#34;multi-line string literals&#34; (and, probably, that&#39;s what a lot of people will call it.) But, we chose a different name,  text blocks, to highlight the fact that a text block is not merely an unrelated collection of lines, but instead better thought of as a  two-dimensional block of textthat is embedded in a Java program. To illustrate what we mean by &#34;two-dimensional&#34;, let&#39;s take a slightly more  ...\n  What does the author expect this to print? While we can&#39;t read their minds, it seems unlikely that the intent was that the XML block should be indented by 21 spaces; it is far more likely that these 21 spaces are there solely to line up the text block with the surrounding code. On the other hand, it is almost certainly the author&#39;s intent that the second line of output should be indented by four more spaces than the first. Further, even if the author did want exactly  ...\n From this example, we can see that the natural indentation of a block of a multi-line block of text embedded in our program source derives both from the desired relative indentation between the lines of the block, and from the relative indentation between the block and the surrounding code. We want our string literals to line up with our code (because they would look out of place if they didn&#39;t), and we want the lines of our string literals to reflect the relative indentation  ...\n One way to address this problem is with a library method we can apply to multi-line string literals, such as Kotlin&#39;s   trimIndent method, and Java indeed does provide such a method:   String::stripIndent. But because this is such a common problem, Java goes farther, automatically stripping the incidental indentation at compile time.\n To disentangle the incidental and essential indentation, we can imagine drawing the smallest possible rectangle around the XML snippet that contains the entire snippet, and treating the contents of this rectangle as a two-dimensional block of text. This &#34;magic rectangle&#34; is the contents of the text block, and reflects the relative indentation between the lines of the block but ignores any indentation that is an artifact of how the program is indented.\n This &#34;magic rectangle&#34; analogy may help motivate how text blocks work, but the details are a little more subtle because we may want finer control over which indentation is deemed incidental vs essential. The balance of incidental vs essential indentation can be adjusted using the position of the trailing delimiter relative to the contents.\n  A text block uses triple-quotes ( &#34;&#34;&#34;) as its opening and closing delimiter, and the remainder of the line with the opening delimiter must be blank. The content of the text block begins on the next line, and continues up until the closing delimiter. The compile-time processing of the block&#39;s contents has three phases:\n Line terminators are normalized. All line terminators are replaced by with the LF ( \\u000A) character. This prevents the value of a text block from being silently affected by the newline conventions of whatever platform the code was last edited on. (Windows uses  CR +  LF to terminate lines; Unix systems use  LF only, and there are even  other schemes in use as well.)\n  Incidental leading white space, and all trailing white space, is removed from each line. Incidental white space is determined as follows:\t Compute a set of  determining lines, which are all the non-blank lines of the result of the previous step, as well as the last line (the line that contains the closing delimiter) even if it is blank;\n  Escape sequences in the content are interpreted. Text blocks use the same set of escape sequences as do string and character literals. Performing these last means that escapes like  \\n,  \\t,  \\s, and  \\&lt;eol&gt; do not affect the whitespace processing. (Two new escape sequences have been added to the set as part of  JEP 368;  \\s for an explicit space, and  \\&lt;eol&gt; as a continuation indicator.)\n In our XML example, all the whitespace would be removed from the first and last line, and the middle two lines would be indented by four spaces, because there are five determining lines in this example -- the four lines containing XML code and the line containing the closing delimiter -- and the lines are all indented by at least as much whitespace as the first line of content. Often enough, this indentation is what is expected, but sometimes we might not want to  ...\n  Because the last line is also a determining line, the common whitespace prefix is now the amount of whitespace before the closing delimiter in the last line of the block, and this is the amount that is removed from each line, leaving the whole block indented by four. We could also manage the indentation programmatically, via the instance method   String::indent), which takes a multi-line string (whether it comes from a text block or not), and indents every line by  ...\n  In the extreme case, if no whitespace stripping is desired, the closing delimiter could be moved all the way back to the left margin:\n  Alternately, we could achieve the same effect by moving the entire body of the text block back to the margin:\n  These rules may sound somewhat complicated at first, but the rules were chosen to balance the various competing concerns of wanting to be able to indent the text block relative to the surrounding program while not generating variable amounts of incidental leading whitespace, and providing an easy way to adjust or opt out of whitespace stripping if the default algorithm is not what is wanted.\n  Java&#39;s string literals do not support interpolation of expressions, as some other languages do; text blocks do not either. (To the extent that we may consider this feature at some point in the future, it would not be specific to text blocks, but applied equally to string literals.) Historically, parameterized string expressions were built with ordinary string concatenation ( +); in Java 5,  String::formatwas added to support &#34;printf&#34; style string formatting.  ...\n Because of the global analysis surrounding whitespace, getting the indentation right when combining text blocks with string concatenation can be tricky. But, a text block evaluates to an ordinary string, so we can still use  String::format to parameterize the string expression. Additionally, we can use the new  String::formatted method, which is an instance version of  String::format:\n  (Unfortunately, this method could not also be called  format because we cannot overload static and instance methods with the same name and parameter lists.\n  While string literals are, in some sense, a &#34;trivial&#34; feature, they are used frequently enough that small irritations can add up. So it should be no surprise that the lack of multi-line strings has been one of the most common complaints about Java in recent years, and that many other languages have multiple forms of string literals to support different use cases.\n What may be surprising is the number of different ways that such a feature is expressed in popular languages. It&#39;s easy to say &#34;we want multi-line strings&#34;, but when we survey other languages, we find a surprisingly diverse range of approaches in both syntax and goals. (And, of course, a comparably broad range of developer opinions about the &#34;right&#34; way to do it.) While no two languages are the same, for most features that are common to  ...\n The following table shows (some of) the options for string literals in various languages. In each, the  ... is considered the content of the string literal, which may or may not be processed for escape sequences and embedded interpolations,  xxx represents a user-chosen nonce that is guaranteed to not conflict with the contents of the string, and  ## represents a variable number of  # symbols (which may be zero.)\n   esc. Some degree of escape sequence processing, where escapes are usually derived from the C style (e.g.,  \\n);\n      here. A &#34;here-doc&#34;, where the following lines, up until a line that contains only the user-selected nonce, are treated as the body of the string literal.\n  prefix. The prefix form is valid with all the other forms of string literals, and have been omitted for brevity.\n  delim. The delimiter is customizable to some degree, whether by inclusion of a nonce (C++), a varying number of  # characters (Rust, Swift), or swapping curly braces for other matched brackets (Ruby).\n While this table gives a flavor for the diversity in approaches to string literals, it really only scratches the surface, as the variety of subtleties in how languages interpret string literals are too varied to be captured in such a simple form. While most languages use an escape language inspired by C, they vary in exactly what escapes they support, whether and how they support unicode escapes (e.g.,  \\unnnn), and whether forms that don&#39;t support  ...\n The most obvious axis of variation across languages is the choice of delimiters, and how different delimiters signal different forms of string literals (with or without escapes, single or multiple lines, with or without interpolation, choice of character encodings, etc.) But reading between the lines, we can see how these syntactic choices often reflect philosophical differences about language design -- how to balance the various goals such as simplicity,  ...\n Not surprisingly, the scripting languages (bash, Perl, Ruby, Python) have made &#34;user choice&#34; their first priority, with many forms of literals which may vary in non-orthogonal ways (and often, multiple ways to express the same thing.) But in general, languages are all over the map in how they encourage users to think about string literals, how many forms they expose, and how orthogonal those forms are. We also see several philosophies about strings  ...\n Despite the range of approaches and opinions, from the perspective of balancing principled design with expressiveness, there is a clear &#34;winner&#34; from this survey:  Swift. It manages to support escaping, interpolating, and true raw-ness with a single, flexible mechanism (in both single- and multi-line variants.) It should not be surprising that the newest language in the group has the cleanest story, as it had the benefit of hindsight and could  ...\n  Text blocks were not the first iteration of this feature; the first iteration was   raw string literals. Like Rust&#39;s raw strings, it used a variable-sized delimiter (any number of backtick characters) and didn&#39;t interpret the contents at all. This proposal was withdrawn after it was fully designed and prototyped, as it was judged that, while it was sound enough, felt too &#34;nailed on the side&#34; -- it had too little common with traditional  ...\n One major objection to the JEP 326 approach is that raw strings worked differently in every way from traditional string literals; different delimiter characters, varying vs fixed delimiters, single- vs multi-line, escaping vs non-escaping. Invariably, someone is going to want some different combination of choices, and there will be calls for more different forms, leading us down the road that Bash took. On top of that, it didn&#39;t do anything to  ...\n  Jim Laskey and Stuart Marks, of the Java team at Oracle, have published a  programmer&#39;s guide outlining the details, and style recommendations, for text blocks.\n Use text blocks when it improves the clarity of code.Concatenation, escaped newlines, and escaped quote delimiters obfuscate the contents of a string literal; text blocks get &#34;out of the way&#34; so the contents are more obvious, but they are syntactically heavier than traditional string literals. Use them where the benefits pay for the extra costs; if a string fits on a single line and has no escaped newlines, it is probably best to stick with  ...\n Avoid in-line text blocks within complex expressions. While text blocks are string-valued expressions, and therefore can be used anywhere a string is expected, it is not always best to nest text blocks within complex expressions; it is sometimes better to pull it out into a separate variable. In the following example, the text block breaks up the flow of the code when reading, forcing readers to mentally switch gears:\n String poem = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(&#34;jabberwocky.txt&#34;)));String middleVerses = Pattern.compile(&#34;\\\\n\\\\n&#34;) .splitAsStream(poem) .match(verse -&gt; !&#34;&#34;&#34; \u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. &#34;&#34;&#34;.equals(verse)) .collect(Collectors.joining(&#34;\\n\\n&#34;));\n If we pull the text block into its own variable, it is easier for readers to follow the flow of the computation:\n String firstLastVerse = &#34;&#34;&#34; \u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. &#34;&#34;&#34;;String poem = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(&#34;jabberwocky.txt&#34;)));String middleVerses = Pattern.compile(&#34;\\\\n\\\\n&#34;) .splitAsStream(poem) .match(verse -&gt; !firstLastVerse.equals(verse)) .collect(Collectors.joining(&#34;\\n\\n&#34;));\n Avoid mixing spaces and tabs in the indentation of a text block. The algorithm for stripping incidental indentation computes a common whitespace prefix, and therefore will still work if lines are  consistently indented with a combination of spaces and tabs. However, this is obviously brittle and error-prone, so it is best to avoid mixing them -- use one or the other.\n Align text blocks with the neighboring Java code. Since incidental whitespace is automatically stripped, we should take advantage of this to make code easier to read. While we might be tempted to write:\n void printPoem() { String poem = &#34;&#34;&#34;\u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy tovesDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;All mimsy were the borogoves,And the mome raths outgrabe.&#34;&#34;&#34;; System.out.print(poem);\n because we don&#39;t want any leading indentation in our strings, most of the time we should write:\n void printPoem() { String poem = &#34;&#34;&#34; \u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. &#34;&#34;&#34;; System.out.print(poem);}\n  Don&#39;t feel obligated to line up the text with the opening delimiter. We can choose to line up the text block contents with the opening delimiter:\n String poem = &#34;&#34;&#34; \u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. &#34;&#34;&#34;;\n This might seem attractive, but can be cumbersome if the lines are long or the delimiter starts far to the left margin, because now the text will be sticking all the way into the right margin. But this form of indentation isn&#39;t required; we can use any continuation indentation, as long as we do so consistently:\n String poem = &#34;&#34;&#34; \u2019Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. &#34;&#34;&#34;;\n When a text block contains an embedded triple quote, only escape the first quote. While it is allowable to escape every quote, it is not necessary, and interferes needlessly with readability; escaping only the first quote is needed:\n String code = &#34;&#34;&#34; String source = \\&#34;&#34;&#34; String message = &#34;Hello, World!&#34;; System.out.println(message); \\&#34;&#34;&#34;; &#34;&#34;&#34;;\n Consider splitting very long lines with \\. Along with text blocks, we get two new escape sequences,  \\s (for a literal space) and  \\&lt;newline&gt; (a continuation line indicator.) If we have literals with very long lines, we can use  \\&lt;newline&gt; to put a line break in the source code but which is removed during the compile-time escape processing of the string.\n  String literals in Java programs are not limited to short strings like  &#34;yes&#34; and  &#34;no&#34;; they often correspond to entire &#34;programs&#34; in structured languages such as HTML, SQL, XML, JSON, or even Java. Being able to preserve the two-dimensional structure of that embedded program, without having to muck it up with escape characters and other linguistic intrusions, is less error-prone and results in more readable  ...\n  Brian Goetz\u00a0is the Java Language Architect at Oracle, and was the specification lead for JSR-335 (Lambda Expressions for the Java Programming Language.)

"note_en": "We are excited to announce that the Rust/WinRT project finally has a permanent and public home on GitHub:\n  Rust/WinRT follows in the tradition established by  C++/WinRT of building language projections for the Windows Runtime using standard languages and compilers, providing a natural and idiomatic way for Rust developers to call Windows APIs. Rust/WinRT lets you call any WinRT API past, present, and future using code generated on the fly directly from the metadata describing the API and right into your Rust package where you can call them as if they were just another Rust module.\n The Windows Runtime is based on Component Object Model (COM) APIs under the hood and is designed to be accessed through language projections like C++/WinRT and Rust/WinRT. Those language projections take the metadata describing various APIs and provide natural bindings for the target programming language. As you can imagine, this allows developers to more easily build apps and components for Windows using their desired language. You can then use those Windows APIs to build desktop apps, store  ...\n Microsoft has long depended on C++ as the backbone for so much of what we do, but it has some challenges particularly when it comes to security. Modern C++ certainly makes it easier to write safe and secure C++ if you follow certain careful conventions, but that is often hard to enforce on larger projects. Rust is an intriguing language. It closely resembles C++ in many ways, hitting all the right notes when it comes to compilation, runtime model, type system and deterministic finalization.  ...\n Here below is a simple example of Rust calling a Windows API. The API itself does not matter, but it should give you a sense for how naturally Windows APIs may be called from Rust code. In the following example, we are using the XmlDocument class from the Windows.Data.Xml.Dom namespace to parse and inspect a simple XML document:\n  If you are familiar with Rust, you will notice this looks far more like Rust than it looks like C++ or C#. Notice the snake_case on module and method names and the ? operator for error propagation.\n Here is another example using the Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer namespace to copy some value onto the clipboard:\n  For a more complete example, I encourage you to have a look at Robert Mikhayelyan\u2019s Minesweeper demo. Robert originally wrote a version of the classic game using C++/WinRT and was able to quickly port it over to using Rust/WinRT.  https://github.com/robmikh/minesweeper-rs\n This is a very early public preview, but we have decided to work in the open from here on out. So please give it a try and let us know what you think. We would love the feedback as we continue to develop Rust/WinRT and plan to eventually publish on crates.io. We also hope to provide more seamless interop with existing Win32 and COM APIs including support for  the com-rs crate, which supports COM APIs today.  https://github.com/microsoft/winrt-rs",

"note_en": "This repository holds the Arduino library, KiCAD PCB design files, gerber production files, BOM, and assembly instructions for the open-source computer mouse goodie bag item from the 2018 OSHWA Summit. The circuit design, PCB layout, and code were produced by Joel Murphy (aka biomurph | @SafeForRobots) in the Summer of 2018. The mouse wheel and wheel holder were designed in collaboration with Eugene Chang, and manufactured by  Tangible Creative. The production PCB boards were fabricated and stuffed  ...\n      Yes, yes it did. Years ago, I tried to make a go of it in open-source hardware design, production and sales. I made something like  this before SparkFun did, but it never got off the ground. I&#39;ve been sitting on a small pile of components from those days, and this summer I decided that I have to chip away at that pile. So here you go. A fully functional computer mouse for you to hack and modify to your hearts delight. You&#39;re welcome!\n If you are interested in modifying the design files to bring this project up to date, the one place that I have found that still sells these kinds of optical mouse sensors is a company called  PixArt that has a variety of sensors to choose from. One of my goals is to do just that, so watch this repo if you want to be among the first to know when I have a working prototype.\n  Either download the ZIP of this repo or clone it. Then move or copy the file named  Mouseyinto your  Documents &gt; Arduino &gt; libraries folder. Open or restart Arduino, Thengoto  File &gt; Examples &gt; Mousey &gt; OpenMouse to find the sketch that runs on OpenMouse.\n  This open-source computer mouse is built around an ATmega32u4 with the Arduino Leonardo bootloader. It has already been programmed with the example sketch from the Mousey library. There are two modes of operation HID and Not-HID. Modes are selected using the slide switch on the left side of the mouse.\n  When the slide switch is on the side closest to the pad per hole prototyping area (aka DOWN), the mouse is in HID mode. When plugged into a micro USB cable, the mouse will read the sensors (wheel, buttons, optical sensor), and function just like a mouse attached to your computer!\n  When the slide switch is on the side closest to the 7 pin female header (aka UP), the mouse is in the Not-HID mode. When plugged into a micro USB cable, the mouse will read the sensors (wheel, buttons, optical sensor) and send the data it gets over serial at 115200 baud. You can open any serial terminal to view the data from the mouse.\n  The mice were packaged with the HID select switch in the HID position. If you plug your mouse in to a computer and it doesn&#39;t work like a mouse should, then check to make sure that the HID switch is in HID mode. The small tact switch labeled  SW1is the reset button for the Leonardo. You can switch modes on the fly, and press this reset button to change modes without unplugging your mouse. If all else fails, re-program the mouse with the OpenMouse.ino code from the example in the Mousey  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:13", "tags":

"note_en": "Like the rest of the world, Canadian drone maker  Draganflyhas been anxiously watching the spread of the novel coronavirus. And when COVID-19 cases started springing up across Washington nursing homes in mid-February, the team began brainstorming. By March, Draganfly had licensed the machine vision and AI tech needed to offer social distancing and health monitoring services from the air. Demand to test the technology was \u201cinsatiable, \u201dnot just from government and law enforcement, but also from health  ...\n But the story doesn\u2019t end there. We spoke with Draganfly CEO Cameron Chell  before and after the abrupt termination of the Westport pilot. The drone company has two more pilots scheduled to start in less than two weeks. Chell says Draganfly has been \u201cinundated \u201dwith requests from other jurisdictions, while the numbers on the private side \u201care even more prolific. \u201dIndeed, the next couple of U.S. pilots will be in the private sector. One is drone-based, and the other is facility-based. Additional  ...\n  As federal and local governments wrestle with the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 from tracking the spread of COVID-19 to gauging when to lift restrictions \u2014 everyone is taking a closer look at autonomous technologies like  drones and  robots. The public and private sectors are desperate for technology that can help limit human contact and provide early detection data on the implementation and effectiveness of measures like social distancing. Any business that relies on human interaction, whether with customers  ...\n  Unlike most drone companies, Draganfly has decades of experience. It was founded in 1998, and Chell prides himself on leading \u201cthe oldest commercial drone manufacturer in the world.\u201d The Canadian company has some 25 employees and is based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, with offices in Vancouver; Los Angeles; and Raleigh, North Carolina. Until this month, Draganfly was arguably best known for developing  the first drone credited with saving a human life, in 2013.\n  VB Transform 2020 Online - July 15-17, 2020: Join leading AI executives at VentureBeat&#39;s AI event of the year.  Register today and save 30% off digital access passes.\n Cheap consumer drones have become popular in recent years, thanks to market leaders  DJI and  Parrot. But none of Draganfly \u2019s four revenue streams is consumer-related. The first is contract engineering (primarily for tier one U.S.-based military contractors). The second is original systems manufacturing, meaning building drones  ...\n  While Draganfly does not build consumer drones itself, it has designed various payloads, gimbal attachments, and software integrations for its customers that do. The company prefers highly specialized work for the likes of U.S. marshals and border patrol. Forget cheap drones \u2014think batteries that operate in colder weather,  ...\n Draganfly customers \u201cgenerally have a higher performance requirement, \u201dChell told VentureBeat. \u201cThey have some specialized needs that our engineering is attuned to. Also, they tend to not necessarily buy as much foreign product. The buyers in that area are a bit more conscientious, certainly on a military level, of security  ...\n  Some 12 weeks ago, when \u201cthings got scary in Washington with nursing homes,\u201d the Draganfly team was trying to figure out how drones could help. But they wanted to do more than just use drones to yell at people from the skies.\n \u201cWe were like,  \u2018Put a loudspeaker on a drone?\u2019 Big deal. Really? That\u2019s not innovative,\u201d Chell declared. \u201cWe were thinking if this hits, we need to be able to provide more value than very typical use cases like that.\u201d\n The company realized it did not have the AI chops to pull off what it really wanted to do. So it started talking to its partners.\n  \u201cWe went looking for it, \u201dChell said. \u201cWe were thinking \u2018Oh, thermal cameras! \u2019Probably every person in the world has thought about thermal cameras. And we debunked the use of those very quickly. Thermal doesn \u2019t measure core temperature, which is what is required to understand if there \u2019s a potential fever present.  ...\n The Canadian company researched, built use cases, ran tests, and in the space of a few weeks had signed a deal. Draganfly paid $1.5 million to license a health and respiratory monitoring platform, the Vital Intelligence Project, developed in a collaboration between UniSA and the Australian Department of Defence Science  ...\n The Vital Intelligence Project can help estimate the distances between people, but it can also monitor temperatures, heart rates, and respiratory rates of individuals in crowds and workforces. Draganfly envisioned the tech being deployed by airlines and cruise ships; for potential at-risk groups, like seniors in care  ...\n \u201cWe licensed it for camera networks and for drones, \u201dChell explained. UniSA built the core technology \u2014\u201cthe specific machine vision and AI in a non-productized form. \u201dDraganfly simply happened to have the public research university in its Rolodex. The company then developed the productized form, including camera  ...\n \u201cThat includes everything from going out and doing the policy development work through to what the GUI needs to look like, \u201dChell said. \u201cBoth software and mechanical engineering to provide stabilization on the drones so that they \u2019re optimized to collect this data. That piece of IP, go to market, and actual commercialization  ...\n  Still, some repurposing was required, as the Vital Intelligence Project was not exactly being used to monitor groups of people.\n \u201cThey were using it so that they can fly helicopters over \u2026disaster relief zones and pick up the vital signs of survivors on the ground, \u201dChell said. \u201cThey could determine what resources they needed to apply where or the severity of survivors \u2019current situation, and did they need to get them right at that moment.  ...\n Draganfly and the university took the technology and adapted it for social distancing and health monitoring. To be clear, the Vital Intelligence Project had never been strapped to a drone and pointed at a crowd before the Westport pilot.\n \u201cThe previous use case that would be most similar to this one was designed to be used in disaster relief areas to get the vital signs of survivors on the ground, \u201dChell said. \u201cThose happen to be the same set of vital signs that we can now pick up anonymized in a crowd to determine if there \u2019s infectious or respiratory  ...\n  Draganfly started test flights in Westport, Connecticut to identify social distancing and detect symptoms. The city is in Fairfield County, adjacent to New York City and considered the epicenter for the spread of the coronavirus in Connecticut.\n The three-phase pilot was supposed to validate the technology\u2019s use and have officials develop public safety policy around it. The next step would have been to test those policies. The whole process was supposed to take some 60 days, during which Draganfly hoped to initiate additional pilots.\n  Phase one was to test whether the technology could be an effective resource multiplier, letting officials cover more ground to see if social distancing is being effectively adhered to, for example. Instead of sending a few cruisers out and having officers walk around, they could put one camera up in the sky  ...\n \u201cSocial distancing, which we \u2019ve shown on the videos, that \u2019s actual visual data, \u201dChell said. \u201cIt gives the operator of the camera, typically the officer, the real-time data. They should make operational decisions at that point if they need to separate a crowd. Or everything is fine [and] they don \u2019t need  ...\n  Westport First Selectman Jim Marpe called it the \u201cFlatten the Curve Pilot Program. \u201dIt was supposed to help the community \u201cpractice safe social distancing, while identifying possible coronavirus and other life-threatening symptoms. \u201dPolice Chief Foti Koskinas said at the time: \u201cUsing drones remains a go-to  ...\n There was no health monitoring in phase one. Before the Westport pilot ended, Chell was already calling phase one a \u201csuccess, \u201dso we asked what exactly that meant. \u201cThe technology worked in a real-world environment, \u201dChell said. \u201cSo that was successful. We were able to get very good operational social  ...\n  In announcing the end of the pilot just a couple of days later, Marpe said, \u201cin our good faith effort to get ahead of the virus and potential need to manage and safely monitor crowds and social distancing in this environment, our announcement was perhaps misinterpreted, not well-received, and posed many  ...\n  When we spoke to Chell a few days later, he seemed to understand why the pilot had to end.\n \u201cThe official pushback was around health monitoring, and the misunderstanding around how it works, what it does, and what it \u2019s for, \u201dhe said. \u201cAnd so at this point, Westport just feels politically that they just don \u2019t want to move forward with the project. They had been extremely helpful. They provided  ...\n No part of the Vital Intelligence Project employs facial recognition technology, Draganfly has consistently said. Still, we wondered if the resulting output from phase one could be repurposed to do so. Could someone take the video feed and run a facial recognition algorithm on top of it?\n \u201cNo more than you could do that on a security camera system today, \u201dChell explained. \u201cThe requirements to run social distancing, in terms of resolution and stabilization in the video platform are minute compared to what you have to have in order to run the health measurement platform. So while today  ...\n  The pilot never got to phase two, which was the anonymized health measurement. The plan was to test crowds as sample sets \u2014how many are coughing, sneezing, have a fever (considering heart rate, respiratory rate, high blood pressure, and biometric measurements based on skin tones). We asked if the  ...\n \u201cIt has. There \u2019s some challenges with that at times, \u201dChell admitted. \u201cSo darker skin tones and different types of lights and the rest of it can create some problems. If you have somebody walking up to a kiosk and using this type of technology, it \u2019s a different scenario because it \u2019s a controlled  ...\n  That\u2019s not a problem, Chell insists, because the technology is not meant to identify people. The whole point is to measure the health of a population.\n \u201cWhen you combine things like fever, coughing, elevated heart rate, particular respiratory rates, then you \u2019ve got a picture of health, \u201dChell said. \u201cYou \u2019re not diagnosing if somebody has COVID-19 or not, but you are doing a health measurement and getting a pretty clear idea of the rate of infectious  ...\n  One big difference between phase one and phase two that led to major confusion is that the latter does not output video. Draganfly published videos to show how the technology worked, but that was misleading. The health measurement system does not record the subjects at a location that the drone  ...\n \u201cIt just comes back and says in this particular geographic location, where you did the health measurement data, there were 22 people in the field view. Here are the heart rates, here are the respiratory rates, here are the fevers. Here \u2019s the likelihood, and percentage of, infections and/or  ...\n  \u201cYou need at least that much data time to understand respiratory rate, \u201dChell explained. \u201cIn that timeframe, you also have your heart rate beating so you \u2019re able to collect that data concurrently. You can get biometric measurements of skin tone data quite quickly as well in that timeframe.  ...\n The drone sends the data it collects back to the cloud (Draganfly uses AWS and Fortinet) for processing. \u201cAll of that happens in the cloud through encrypted lines.

It would also remove the ability for nominated Administrative Appeals Tribunal members to issue certain warrants.\n The\u00a0 Bill is a precondition\u00a0for Australia to obtain a proposed bilateral agreement with the United States in order to implement the CLOUD Act.\n The\u00a0 CLOUD Act\u00a0creates a legal framework regulating how law enforcement can access data across borders.\n If the agreement is finalised and approved, service providers in Australia and the US would be able to respond to lawful orders from the other country for access to electronic evidence.\n   A bilateral CLOUD Act agreement would enable Australian law enforcement to serve domestic orders for communications data needed to combat serious crime directly on US-based companies, and vice versa.\n In a  submission [PDF] to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) and\u00a0 its review\u00a0of the IPO Bill, Google said while it encourages and supports efforts by the Australian government to negotiate an executive agreement, it said there are certain elements of the Bill that give it cause for concern.\n   &#34;Especially when considering how the interception powers under this Bill could be used in tandem with technical capability notices under the controversial Telecommunications and Other Legislation (Assistance and Access) Act,&#34; it wrote.\n Making a recommendation to the PJCIS, Google said the Bill should not apply to service providers in their capacity as infrastructure providers to corporations or government entities, saying corporations or government entities are best placed to produce the requested records themselves.\n  Under the Bill, designated communications providers are instructed to provide any requested communications and data to the requesting agency or the Australian Designated Authority. Google would prefer the authority to be a two-way channel.\n &#34;Respectfully, our experience is that a better approach would be that all communications to and from an Australian law enforcement agency be channelled through the Designated Authority and that this authority acts as a coordinator across multiple agencies,&#34; it wrote.\n &#34;Putting in place a coordinating body will guard against the risk of duplication and will act as a single point of contact for training, education, and access to designated communications providers.&#34;\n  Civil penalties for non-compliance with an IPO establishes a framework for compliance. If a designated communications provider receives a valid IPO and the designated communications provider meets the &#34;enforcement threshold&#34; when the IPO is issued, the designated communications provider must comply with the IPO.\n Google labelled the two-step test that is the threshold, a &#34;relatively low bar to meet&#34;.\n &#34;Failure to comply with an IPO may lead to a civil penalty of up to AU$10 million for body corporates. The imposition of a mandatory obligation to comply with an IPO is contrary to the purpose of the CLOUD Act which is to lift blocking statutes, but explicitly does not create a compulsory obligation on service providers,&#34; it said.\n &#34;The authors of the Bill appear to be aware of this dichotomy as the Bill explicitly asserts that Australian service providers do not have to comply with reciprocal requests from international agencies.&#34;\n Specifically, the search giant said it was concerned by the attempt to impose a mandatory obligation on overseas-based designated communications providers that exists &#34;only in the construct of an otherwise non-compulsory international agreement&#34;.\n &#34;[We] respectfully request that this be amended to reflect the intent of the CLOUD Act, which is that enforcement procedures be found in existing law, and that references to civil penalties be removed,&#34; it wrote.\n Elsewhere, Google is seeking further information about the role that eligible judges will play in approving IPOs that involve the interception of communications.\n  &#34;Deferring to existing appeal mechanisms is not satisfactory given the lack of appropriate merit based appeal processes in other relevant legislation such as the TOLA Act,&#34; it continued.\n &#34;The reliance on existing law as the primary source for appeal procedures is especially problematic \u2026 in particular, overseas providers may be subject to other third-country laws, conflicts with which are not and cannot be lifted through the international agreement, yet no option would exist to raise such an impediment to compliance.&#34;\n Google said this would create exactly the type of conflict of laws scenario that the CLOUD Act is designed to prevent.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:05:07", "tags": "google,\u8c37\u6b4c,\u5e0c\u671b,australia,\u6cd5\u6848", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u5e0c\u671b\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u53d6\u6d88\u4e91\u6cd5\u6848\u51c6\u5907\u6cd5\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u6c11\u4e8b\u5904\u7f5a", "title_en": "Google wants Australia to remove civil penalties from CLOUD Act-readying Bill", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-wants-australia-to-remove-civil-penalties-from-cloud-act-readying-bill/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "\u5e0c\u671b", "australia", "\u6cd5\u6848"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000296, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "SeaFox\u6839\u636eESTree AST\u683c\u5f0f\u751f\u6210AST\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eJavaScript\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u5206\u6790(\u89e3\u6790)\u6216\u8bcd\u6cd5\u5206\u6790(\u6807\u8bb0\u5316)\uff0c\u5728ES2015\u53ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\uff0cJavaScript\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u811a\u672c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u6a21\u5757\u3002\nSeafox\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a5\u53d7\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9009\u7684Options\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u8be5\u5bf9\u8c61\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u6307\u5b9a\u662f\u4ee5\u811a\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f(\u9ed8\u8ba4)\u8fd8\u662f\u4ee5\u6a21\u5757\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u3002\n{//\u5141\u8bb8\u4f7f\u7528Module\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff1f\uff1aboolean\uff1b//\u542f\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u548c\u7ed3\u675f\u504f\u79fb\u4ee5\u53ca\u884c/\u5217\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6807\u5fd7loc\uff1afalse\uff1b//\u7981\u7528web\u517c\u5bb9\u6027disableWebCompat\uff1afalse\uff1b//\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u5c5e\u6027\u9644\u52a0\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u5b57\u548c\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u8282\u70b9raw\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\uff1afalse\uff1b//Enabled\u6307\u4ee4\u6307\u4ee4\uff1afalse\uff1b//\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u4f5c\u7528\u57dfglobalReturn\uff1afalse\u4e2d\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\uff1b//\u542f\u7528\u9690\u542b\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6a21\u5f0fImpliedStrict\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\u3002\n\u4ece&#39\uff1b\u5bfc\u5165{parseScript\uff0cparseModule\uff0cparse}\u3002/SeaFox&#39\uff1b\uff1bparseScript(&#39\uff1b({x\uff1a[y]=0}=1)&#39\uff1b)\uff1bparseModule(&#39\uff1b({x\uff1a[y]=0}=1)&#39\uff1b\uff0c{\u6307\u4ee4\uff1atrue\uff0craw\uff1atrue})\uff1bparse(&#39\uff1b({x\uff1a[y]=0}=1)&#39\uff1b\uff0c{\u3002parse(&#39\uff1b({x\uff1a[y]=0}=1)&#39\uff1b)\uff1b\n\u8bcd\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u89e3\u6790\u671f\u95f4\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u63a5\u53d7\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9009\u9879\u3002\n\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u5f00\u59cb\u548c\u7ed3\u675f\u542f\u7528loc\u9009\u9879\u3002\u5426\u5219\uff0c\u6b64\u503c\u5c06\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\nSeaFox\u662f\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u800c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\uff0c\u8be5\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u6bd4\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6javascript\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u5feb2\u500d\u52304\u500d\u3002", "note_en": "Seafox generates  AST according to  ESTree AST format, and can be used to perform  syntactic analysis (parsing) or  lexical analysis (tokenization) of a JavaScript program, and with  ES2015 and later a JavaScript program can be either  a script or a module.\n The  parse method exposed by  Seafox takes an optional  options object which allows you to specify whether to parse in   script mode (the default) or in   module mode.\n  {   // Allow parsing using Module as the goal symbol  module ?: boolean;

"note_en": "In the previous  post we have seen how to visualize a time series data. In this post we will discuss how to do a time series modelling using ARMA and ARIMA models. Here AR stands for Auto-Regressive and MA stands for Moving Average\n Before we start discussing the ARIMA models, we should know the stationarity of time series\n  A time series is called to be stationary if there is no change in mean, variance and covariance of the observations over a period of time.\n  In other words a process is said to be stationary if the joint distribution of observations does not change and remain same when the origin of time is shifted by amount k\n This means that the mean and variance are constant and do not depend on time. There are two types of stationary processes: Strict &amp; Weak Stationary Process\n      ARIMA stands for Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average and it\u2019s one of the widely used time series models for forecasting\n It also accounts for the pattern of growth/decline in the data or noise between consecutive time points\n ARIMA are applied to data that shows Non-Stationarity and difference of successive observations are taken to eliminate the non-stationarity. Sometimes more than one difference of successive observation is required to get a modified stationary model\n That\u2019s the reason it is called as an Integrated model because the stationary model that is fitted to the modified series has to be summed or integrated to provide a model for the original non-stationary series\n   We should be fitting the ARIMA model to a Stationary and non-seasonal time series data and follow the procedure described in the above flow chart\n First thing is you should plot the data to find hidden patterns, trends and other behavior\n  To stabilize and normalize the data you can use the Box-Cox transformation. It is a way to transform data that ordinarily do not follow a normal distribution\n Plot ACF/PACF to determine the order for the ARIMA model i.e. p,d and q values. Alternatively, you can also use AICc and BICc to determine the p,q,d values. Choose the one where AICc and BICc is lowest\n Verify the Residuals and ensure it looks like white noise otherwise try a modified model with different values of p,q and d. Remember Residuals which are white noise can do a forecast\n   We will be using the Monthly Temperature datatset of Armori City. You can download it from this  link\n  import pandas as pdimport statsmodels.api as smimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snssns.set(rc={&#39;figure.figsize&#39;:(15,6)})%matplotlib inlinedf = pd.read_csv(&#39;./monthly_temperature_aomori_city.csv&#39;)df[&#39;DATE&#39;] = pd.to_datetime(df[[&#39;year&#39;, &#39;month&#39;]].assign(DAY=1))df.drop([&#39;year&#39;,&#39;month&#39;],inplace=True,axis=1)df[&#39;temperature&#39;] = df[&#39;temperature&#39;]*(9/5)+32df.set_index(&#39;DATE&#39;,inplace=True)df.to_csv(&#39;./monthly_temperature_aomori_city_updt.csv&#39;,index=True)df.head()\n   Let\u2019s draw a simple line plot for first 200 rows to understand the pattern in the data and how the temperature is trending. It looks like that a Cyclic pattern is followed here\n    We will draw a Box and Whisker plot for first 5 years to understand the data distribution and get a quick five point summary for the data\n    If you are looking for in-depth tutorial on Time Series Analysis and Visualization you can check  this blog, which is part 1 of this time series analysis blogs\n  To further analyze the time series data, Decomposition helps to remove the seasonality from the data.\n Basically Decomposition has three components that is shown in the graphs below i.e Trend, Seasonality and Residual\n You have to choose a model type also additive or multiplicative. We have taken an additive model because the seasonality doesn\u2019t varies much from start to end of the years\n          ARIMA model works better on a Non-Stationary data and the first thing that we should be checking is the Stationarity of the data. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test can be used to test the null hypothesis that the series is non-stationary\n The ADF test helps to understand whether a change in Y is a linear trend or not. If there is a linear trend but the lagged value cannot explain the change in Y over time, then our data will be deemed non-stationary\n  from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfullerdef check_stationarity(timeseries): result = adfuller(timeseries,autolag=&#39;AIC&#39;) dfoutput = pd.Series(result[0:4], index=[&#39;Test Statistic&#39;,&#39;p-value&#39;,&#39;#Lags Used&#39;,&#39;Number of Observations Used&#39;]) print(&#39;The test statistic: %f&#39; % result[0]) print(&#39;p-value: %f&#39; % result[1]) print(&#39;Critical Values:&#39;) for key, value in result[4].items(): print(&#39;\\t%s: %.3f&#39; % (key, value))\n   The value of test statistics is less than 5% critical value and p-value is also less than 0.05 so we can reject the null hypothesis and Alternate Hypothesis that time series is Stationary seems to be true\n   There is nothing unusual about the time plot and there appears to be no need to do any data adjustments. There is no evidence of changing variance also so we will not do a Box-Cox transformation.\n  So what does model order of ARIMA(2,1,3) means? It means 2nd order Auto-Regressive (AR) and 3rd order Moving Average (MA). You can think it as ARIMA( AR(p), I(d), MA(q))\n So the d is Integrated I(d) part that is decided based on number of times you have to do a data difference to make it stationary. We will learn more about it in the next section\n  For Moving Average order i.e. q you have to look at the Auto Correlation Factor(ACF) graph. You need some experience to keenly look at the graphs and significant lags and corresponding Correlations to determine the value\n Similarly for the Auto-Regressive order i.e. p you have to look at the partial correlation factor (pacf) graph\n Another Alternate way is to find the set of models with the lowest AIC values Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion\n For determining AIC you have to fit the model with different combination of p,q and d and look for the lowest AIC value\n  Our Data is stationary but just to showcase how data differencing works we will assume that our Time Series data is not Stationary\n We will also do a log transform of the original data to make the seasonality same throughout the data\n   So Basically you have to subtract the value with their previous value to get the difference in data. We will use numpy.diff() function to achieve that\n    The differenced data looks stationary so we don\u2019t have to go for any further differencing\n Again, After our first data differencing we will check the stationarity of data using the ADF test.\n This time the p-value is 0 which is very good and the test statistics is also less than the 5% critical\n     The value of d will be 1 because we have done the data difference one time to achieve stationarity\n  Once our data is set to stationary then the next task is to determine the appropriate value of ARIMA model i.e. p and q\n We can learn some important properties of our time series data with the help of Auto Correlation(ACF) and Partial Auto Correlation (PACF) graphs.\n This provide useful descriptive properties for understanding which model can be used for time series forecasting\n  In other words, ACF is used to understand if there exists a correlation between a time series data point with another point as a function of their time difference\n The Partial Auto Correlation factor(PACF) is the partial correlation between the two points at a specific lag of time.\n Plotting the partial autocorrelative functions one could determine the appropriate lags\u00a0 p\u00a0in an AR ( p)\u00a0model or in an extended\u00a0ARIMA\u00a0( p, d, q) model\n       From the PACF plot we can see a significant correlation at lag of 2. So the PACF suggests an AR(2) model. So an inital order for the model will be (2,0,3)\n  Alternatively, you can also use auto arima to find the appropriate value of p,q and d\n  So if you want to know the value of p,q and d without much of pain then use  Auto arima.\n It\u2019s a python library inspired from the auto arima package in R which is used to find the best fit ARIMA model for the univariate time series data\n  import pyramid as pmauto_arima_fit = pm.auto_arima(df, start_p=1, start_q=1, max_p=3, max_q=3, m=12, start_P=0, seasonal=True, d=1, D=1, trace=True, error_action=&#39;ignore&#39;, suppress_warnings=True, stepwise=True)\n  Fit ARIMA: order=(1, 1, 1) seasonal_order=(0, 1, 1, 12); AIC=7044.189, BIC=7071.210, Fit time=29.769 secondsFit ARIMA: order=(0, 1, 0) seasonal_order=(0, 1, 0, 12); AIC=8721.729, BIC=8732.538, Fit time=0.218 secondsFit ARIMA: order=(1, 1, 0) seasonal_order=(1, 1, 0, 12); AIC=8072.542, BIC=8094.159, Fit time=5.261 seconds\n This will help to choose the best value of p,q and d based on the lowest AIC and BIC values\n  Now we have to fit our data to the ARIMA using the order of model (2,0,3) determined above using ACF and PACF plot.\n This sets the lag value to 2 for autoregression AR(2) and uses a data difference order of 0 since our time series is stationary, and uses a moving average model of 3.\n     A model residuals is difference between the predicted and expected value and can be verified using the fitted model property resid().\n Residual object is of type ndarray so we will store it in a Dataframe for plotting\n In the below line plot we don\u2019t see any large residuals and all of them are within their upper and lower limits\n    Next we will check if these residuals are normally distributed and looks Gaussian or not. So we will plot the density plot to check this. This looks normal with a long left tail and centered at Zero\n    The mean of the residual is close to Zero and there is no significant correlation also that we can see in the pacf plot for residuals\n       The residual diagnostics looks like a white noise since 95% of our sample autocorrelations is between the two blue lines and it meets all our criteria for a good forecast and prediction.\n    Predict function takes a start and end parameters to specify the index at which to start and stop the prediction\n We could have done it another way also by splitting the train and test data and then comparing the test values with the predicted values\n In our case we want to validate the predicted and expected value of first three years 1882-1885. so we will give a start value of 0 and end value of 36 and that will return an ndarray of predicted values\n  Using this returned value and the original value we will plot this and visualize how the predicted and real values differ. The red lines in the graph are original values and green are predicted values\n     This looks good so far but how to quantify how the score of predicted vs Expected values. For this we will calculate the Root Mean Square Error values using Scipy\n      Next and Final Step to forecast the temperature of upcoming years i.e. Out of Sample Forecast. We will use the forecast method of statsmodel for this task.\n You can pass steps as one of the parameter i.e. number of out of sample forecasts from the end of the sample\n    We are forecasting the temperature for next 3 years i.e. 36 months so our steps will be 36 and for a confidence interval of 95% we will pass the alpha value as 0.05\n      It is stored in a variable ci above and this is how the interval value looks like\n    Now we will plot the forecast value which is shown as red line for year 2020 thru 2023 in the below graph.\n The blue strip that you see around the line is the forecast interval which is drawn with the help of fill_between() api of matplotlib\n      Time Series Data Visualization is an important step to understand for analysis &amp; forecasting and finding out the patterns in data\n Dickey-Fuller test performed to determine if the data is stationary or not. It\u2019s necessary to check the stationarity before fitting the data to ARIMA\n Decomposition helps to remove the seasonality from the data and three components of decomposition are Trend, Seasonality and Residual\n Data differencing helps to remove stationarity from data and to determine the value of d\n Plot Auto-Correlation(ACF) and Partial Auto-Correlation (PACF) graph to determine the value of p and q\n Auto Arima package used to determine the value of p,q and d by evaluating the value of Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC)\n Residual diagnosis is an important step post fitting the ARIMA model to evaluate if forecasting can be done with the fitted model or not\n Residual property of ARIMAResult object used for the Residual Analysis. If the residual is a white noise then we are good and ready for forecasting\n  There are few topics which I have not explained in detail like Additive and Multiplicative Model, Determine the p,q value by reading the ACF and PACF plot and using SARIMAX function for time series data with seasonality. So I would be covering those topics separately in my upcoming posts\n Facebook has an open source tool  Prophet for forecasting time series data and in my next post I will be using prophet to evaluate

"note_en": "Fighting complexity is a recurring theme of software development I&#39;ve seen repeat itself over and over again. It&#39;s something I keep seeing debated at all levels: just how much commenting should go on in functions and methods? What&#39;s the ideal amount of abstraction? When does a framework start having &#34;too much magic&#34;? When are there too many languages in an organisation?\n We try to get rid of the complexity, control it, and seek simplicity. I think framing things that way is misguided. Complexity has to live somewhere.\n One thing Resilience Engineering has taught me is the concept of  Requisite Variety from cybernetics: only complexity can handle complexity.\n  if you make the build tool simple, it won&#39;t handle all the weird edge cases that exist out there\n if you want to handle the weird edge cases, you need to deviate from whatever norm you wanted to establish\n if you want ease of use for common defaults, the rules for common defaults must be shared between the tool and the users, who shape their systems to fit the tool&#39;s expectations\n if you allow configuration or scripting, you give the users a way to specify the rules that must be shared, so the tool fits their systems\n if you want to keep the tool simple, you have to force your users to only play within the parameters that fit this simplicity\n if your users&#39; use cases don&#39;t map well to your simplicity, they will build shims around your tool to attain their objectives\n This cannot be avoided. Complexity  has to live somewhere. It&#39;s always a part of people solving problems, whether you realize it or not.\n Unfortunately, if we make it to the last point of the list (we always do in some way), the shims become part of the landscape. Complexity doesn&#39;t lay dormant. It is part of everyone&#39;s learning experience, and they adapt to it.\n They work around it, see the mismatch between two clashing concepts. That necessary complexity may move around \u2014back into the tool (or a new tool) \u2014or be removed by re-structuring things. Each such change requires an effort and more adjustments, and for people to see the complexity, understand the complexity, and tackle the complexity. And in some cases, changes will not simplify things, they will complexify them by creating new mismatches between assumptions various people had, which will  ...\n In   The Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman mentions the concept of &#34;Knowledge in the head&#34; and &#34;knowledge in the world&#34; (similar concepts are more academically presented in Roesler &amp; Woods&#39;   Designing for Expertise). Knowledge in the head are things you know, that you have learned, that are in your memory. Knowledge in the world is everything else: information written down, cues in design (you know the power button by looking at its symbol, and you know it can  ...\n In some ways, expertise is having knowledge in your head that allows you to better read the world.\n  A common trap we have in software design comes from focusing on how &#34;simple&#34; we find it to read and interpret a given piece of code. Focusing on simplicity is fraught with peril because complexity can&#39;t be removed: it can just be shifted around. If you move it out of your code, where does it go?\n When we designed Rebar3, we felt the tool could be simple. The condition for its simplicity is that you have a basic understanding of the expected structure of Erlang/OTP projects. As long as you follow these rules, things will go well. We externalized some of the complexity into the broader ecosystem. The rules always needed to be learned (so we assumed), but the tool now depended on them being understood. In simplifying tool usage for people who knew the rules, we made it harder for  ...\n The trap is insidious in software architecture. When we adopt something like microservices, we try to make it so that each service is individually simple. But unless this simplicity is so constraining that your actual application inherits it and is forced into simplicity, it still has to go somewhere. If it&#39;s not in the individual microservices, then where is it?\n Complexity has to live  somewhere. If you are lucky, it lives in well-defined places. In code where you decided a bit of complexity should go, in documentation that supports the code, in training sessions for your engineers. You give it a place without trying to hide all of it. You create ways to manage it. You know where to go to meet it when you need it. If you&#39;re unlucky and you just tried to pretend complexity could be avoided altogether, it has no place to go in this world.  ...\n With nowhere to go, it has to roam everywhere in your system, both in your code and in people&#39;s heads. And as people shift around and leave, our understanding of it erodes.\n Complexity has to live somewhere. If you embrace it, give it the place it deserves, design your system and organisation knowing it exists, and focus on adapting, it might just become a strength.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:04:51",

"note_en": "Yesterday Apple released iOS 13.5 beta 3 (seemingly renaming iOS 13.4.5 to 13.5 there), and that killed one of my bugs. It wasn\u2019t just any bug though, it was the first 0day I had ever found. And it was probably also the best one. Not necessarily for how much it gives you, but certainly for how much I\u2019ve used it for, and also for how ridiculously simple it is. So simple, in fact, that  the PoC I tweeted out looks like an absolute joke. But it\u2019s 100% real.\n I dubbed it \u201cpsychic paper\u201d because, just like  the item by that name that Doctor Who likes to carry, it allows you get past security checks and make others believe you have a wide range of credentials that you shouldn\u2019t have.\n In contrast to virtually any other bug and any other exploit I\u2019ve had to do with, this one should be understandable without any background knowledge in iOS and/or exploitation. In that spirit, I\u2019ll also try and write this post in a manner that assumes no iOS- or exploitation-specific knowledge. I do expect you however to loosely know what XML, public key encryption and hashes are, and understanding C code is certainly a big advantage.\n So strap in for the story of what I\u2019ll boldly claim to be the most elegant exploit for the most powerful sandbox escape on iOS yet. :P\n     The basic concept is that  &lt;tag&gt; opens a tag,  &lt;/tag&gt; closes it, and stuff goes in between. That stuff can be either raw text or more tags. Empty tags can be self-closing like  &lt;tag/&gt;, and they can have attributes like  a=&#34;b&#34; as well, yada yada. There\u2019s three things in the above file that go beyond just basic tags:\n &lt;?...?&gt; - Tags starting and ending with question marks, so-called \u201cprocessing instructions\u201d, are treated specially.\n  &lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt; - Tags starting with  !DOCTYPE are, well, \u201cdocument type declarations\u201d and are treated specially as well.\n  &lt;!-- --&gt; - Tags starting with  &lt;!-- and ending with  --&gt; are comments, and they plus their contents are ignored.\n The full XML specification contains  a lot more, but a) that\u2019s irrelevant to us, and b) nobody should ever be forced to read that. Now, XML is horrible to parse for reasons this XKCD illustrates beautifully:\n  So yeah, you can construct  &lt;mis&gt;matched&lt;/tags&gt;,  &lt;attributes that=&#34;are never closed&gt;, even  &lt;tags that are never closed, maybe a tag like this:  &lt;!&gt;, the list simply doesn\u2019t end. This makes XML a format that\u2019s excruciatingly hard to parse correctly, which will become relevant in a bit.\n Now building on XML, we have \u201cproperty list\u201d, or \u201cplist\u201d for short: yet another general-purpose format for storing serialised data. You have arrays, dictionaries with key -&gt; value pairs, strings, numbers, etc. Plist files exist in a bunch of different forms, but the only two that you\u2019ll realistically see in an Apple ecosystem are the \u201cbplist\u201d binary format that are out of scope for this post, and the XML-based format. A valid XML plist can look something like this:\n &lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-8&#34;?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &#34;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&#34; &#34;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&#34;&gt; &lt;plist  version= &#34;1.0&#34; &gt; &lt;dict&gt;  &lt;key&gt;OS Build Version &lt;/key&gt;  &lt;string&gt;19D76 &lt;/string&gt;  &lt;key&gt;IOConsoleLocked &lt;/key&gt;  &lt;false/&gt;  &lt;!-- abc --&gt;  &lt;key&gt;IOConsoleUsers &lt;/key&gt;  &lt;array&gt;  &lt;dict&gt;  &lt;key&gt;kCGSSessionUserIDKey &lt;/key&gt;  &lt;integer&gt;  ...\n Plist files are used all throughout iOS and macOS for configuration files, package properties, and last but not least as part of code signatures.\n So: code signatures. When a binary wants to run on iOS, a kernel extension called AppleMobileFileIntegrity (or \u201cAMFI\u201d) requires it to have a valid code signature, or else it will be killed on the spot. What this code signature looks like isn\u2019t important for us, all that matters is that it is identified by a hashsum. This hash can be validated in one of two ways:\n It can be known to the kernel ahead of time, which is called an \u201cad-hoc\u201d signature. This is used for iOS system apps and daemons, and the hash is simply checked against a collection of known hashes directly in the kernel.\n  It needs to be signed with a valid code signing certificate. This is used for all 3rd party apps, and in this scenario, AMFI calls out to the userland daemon  amfid to have it run all the necessary checks.\n  The App Store certificate. This is held only by Apple themselves and in order to get signed this way, your app needs to pass the App Store review.\n  Developer certificates. This can be the free \u201c7-day\u201d certificates, \u201cregular\u201d developer certificate, or enterprise distribution certificates.\n In the latter case, the app in question will also require a \u201cprovisioning profile\u201d, a file that Xcode (or some 3rd party software) can fetch for you, and that needs to be placed in your  App.ipa bundle at  Payload/Your.app/embedded.mobileprovision. This file is signed by Apple themselves, and specifies the duration, the list of devices, and the developer accounts it is valid for, as well as all the restrictions that should apply to the app.\n  In a standard UNIX environment, pretty much the only security boundaries you get are UID checks. Processes of one UID can \u2019t access resources of another UID, and any resource deemed \u201cprivileged \u201drequires UID 0, i.e. \u201croot \u201d. iOS and macOS still use that, but also introduce the concept of \u201centitlements \u201d. In layman \u2019s terms, entitlements are a list of properties and/or privileges that should be applied to your binary. If present, they are embedded in the code signature of your binary,  ...\n  This would mean that the binary in question \u201cholds the  task_for_pid-allow entitlement\u201d, which in this specific case means is allowed to use the  task_for_pid() mach trap, which is otherwise not allowed at all (at least on iOS). Such entitlements are checked all throughout iOS and macOS and there\u2019s well upwards of a thousand different ones in existence (Jonathan Levin has built  a big catalogue of all the ones he could find, if you \u2019re curious). The important thing is just that all  ...\n This presents an interesting problem. With iOS system apps and daemons, Apple is the one signing them, so they wouldn \u2019t put any entitlements on there that they don \u2019t want the binaries to have. The same goes for App Store apps, where Apple is the one creating the final signature. But with developer certificates, the signature on the binary is created by the developers themselves, and Apple merely signs the provisioning profile. This means that the provisioning profile must create  ...\n  Compared to the over-1000 entitlements in existence, this list is extremely short, with the only two functional entitlements being  keychain-access-groups (related to credentials) and  get-task-allow (allowing your app to be debugged). Not a whole lot to work with.\n  Back in fall 2016  I wrote my first kernel exploit, which was based on the infamous \u201cPegasus vulnerabilities\u201d. Those were memory corruptions in the XNU kernel in a function called  OSUnserializeBinary, which is a subordinate of another function called  OSUnserializeXML. These two functions are used to parse not exactly XML data, but rather plist data - they are  the way of parsing plist data in the kernel. Now given the vulnerabilities I had just written an exploit for, and the still  ...\n At the same time, I was in the process of figuring out how to build an iOS app without Xcode. Partly because I wanted to understand what\u2019s really going on under the hood, and partly because I just hate GUIs for development, especially when you Google how to do something, and the answer is a series of 17 \u201cclick here and there\u201ds that are no longer valid because all the GUI stuff moved somewhere else in the last update. So I was getting a provisioning profile via Xcode every 7 days,  ...\n It was this combination, as well as probably a good portion of dumb luck that made me discover the following bug, and excitedly tweet about it:\n    In an informal sense, it\u2019s clear what it means for a binary to hold an entitlement. But how do you  formally specify that? What would code look like that takes as input a process handle and an entitlement name and just returned a boolean saying whether the process does or does not have that entitlement? Luckily for us, XNU has precisely such a function in   iokit/bsddev/IOKitBSDInit.cpp:\n extern  &#34;C&#34;  boolean_t IOTaskHasEntitlement ( task_t  task ,  const  char  *  entitlement ) {  OSObject  *  obj ;  obj  =  IOUserClient :: copyClientEntitlement ( task ,  entitlement );  if  ( ! obj )  {  return  false ;  }  obj -&gt; release ();  return  obj  !=  kOSBooleanFalse ; }\n The lion\u2019s share of the work here is done by these two functions though, from   iokit/Kernel/IOUserClient.cpp:\n OSDictionary *  IOUserClient :: copyClientEntitlements ( task_t  task ) { #define MAX_ENTITLEMENTS_LEN (128 * 1024)  proc_t  p  =  NULL ;  pid_t  pid  =  0 ;  size_t  len  =  0 ;  void  * entitlements_blob  =  NULL ;  char  * entitlements_data  =  NULL ;  OSObject  * entitlements_obj  =  NULL ;  OSDictionary  * entitlements  =  NULL ;  OSString  * errorString  =  NULL ;  p  =  ( proc_t ) get_bsdtask_info ( task );  if  ( p  ==  NULL )  {  goto  fail ;  }  pid  =  proc_pid ( p );  if  ( cs_entitlements_dictionary_copy ( p ,  ( void  ** ) &amp; entitlements )  ==  0  ...\n So we have a reference implementation for entitlement checks, and it\u2019s backed by  OSUnserializeXML. Great! \u2026or is it?\n A very interesting thing about this bug is that I couldn\u2019t point you at any particular piece of code and say \u201cthere\u2019s my bug\u201d. The reason for that is that, of course, iOS doesn\u2019t have just one, or two, or even three plist parsers, it has at least four! These are:\n    The answer to 1) is \u201call of them\u201d, and to 2)  CFPropertyListCreateWithData. And as a few folks on Twitter already figured out after my tweet, the answer to 3) is obviously \u201clolnope\u201d. Because it\u2019s very hard to parse XML correctly,  valid XML makes all parsers return the same data, but slightly  invalid XML makes them return just slightly  not the same data. :D In other words, any parser difference can be exploited to make different parsers see different things. This is the  ...\n Before we move on to exploiting this, I would like to note that in all my tests,  OSUnserializeXML and  IOCFUnserialize always returned the same data, so for the rest of this post I will consider them as equivalent. For brevity, I will also be dubbing  OSUnserializeXML/ IOCFUnserialize \u201cIOKit\u201d,  CFPropertyListCreateWithData \u201cCF\u201d, and  xpc_create_from_plist \u201cXPC\u201d.\n  Let\u2019s start with the variant of the PoC I tweeted out, which is perhaps the most elegant way of exploiting this bug:\n &lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-8&#34;?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &#34;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&#34; &#34;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&#34;&gt; &lt;plist  version= &#34;1.0&#34; &gt; &lt;dict&gt;  &lt;!-- these aren&#39;t the droids you&#39;re looking for --&gt;  &lt;!---&gt;&lt;!--&gt;  &lt;key&gt;platform-application &lt;/key&gt;  &lt;true/&gt;  &lt;key&gt;com.apple.private.security.no-container &lt;/key&gt;  &lt;true/&gt;  &lt;key&gt;\n The interesting tokens here are  &lt;!---&gt; and  &lt;!--&gt;, which, as per my understanding of the XML specification, are not valid XML tokens. Nonetheless, IOKit, CF and XPC all accept the above XML/plist\u2026 just not exactly in the same way.\n I wrote a little tool called   plparse that I have so far been reluctant to open-source because it emphasises the fact that there exist multiple plist parsers in iOS, and that they certainly don\u2019t all work the same. It takes an input file and any combination of  -c,  -i and  -x args to parse the file with the CF, IOKit and XPC engines respectively. Running on the above file, we get:\n % plparse -cix ent.plist {}{ task_for_pid-allow: true, platform-application: true, com.apple.private.security.no-container: true,}{ com.apple.private.security.no-container: true, platform-application: true, task_for_pid-allow: true,}\n The output is a lazy JSON-like format, but you get the gist of it. At the top is CF, followed by IOKit, and finally XPC. This means that when we slap the above entitlements file on our app (plus app identifier that we need and such) and  amfiduses CF to check whether we have any entitlements that the provisioning profile doesn \u2019t allow, it doesn \u2019t see any. But then when the kernel or some daemon wants to check whether we \u2019re allowed to do Fun Stuff \u2122, they see  ...\n So how does this specific example work? This is the comment tag handling code of CF (the relevant one anyway, there are multiple):\n case  &#39;!&#39; :  // Could be a comment  if  ( pInfo -&gt; curr + 2  &gt;=  pInfo -&gt; end )  {  pInfo -&gt; error  =  __CFPropertyListCreateError ( kCFPropertyListReadCorruptError ,  CFSTR ( &#34;Encountered unexpected EOF&#34; ));  return  false ;  }  if  ( * ( pInfo -&gt; curr + 1 )  ==  &#39;-&#39;  &amp;&amp;  * ( pInfo -&gt; curr + 2 )  ==  &#39;-&#39; )  {  pInfo -&gt; curr  +=  2 ;  skipXMLComment ( pInfo );  }  else  {  pInfo -&gt; error  =  __CFPropertyListCreateError ( kCFPropertyListReadCorruptError ,  CFSTR ( &#34;Encountered  ...\n  if  ( c  ==  &#39;!&#39; )  {  c  =  nextChar ();  bool  isComment  =  ( c  ==  &#39;-&#39; )  &amp;&amp;  (( c  =  nextChar ())  !=  0 )  &amp;&amp;  ( c  ==  &#39;-&#39; );  if  ( ! isComment  &amp;&amp;  ! isAlpha ( c ))  {  return  TAG_BAD ;  // &lt;!1, &lt;!-A, &lt;!eos  }  while  ( c  &amp;&amp;  ( c  =  nextChar ())  !=  0 )  {  if  ( c  ==  &#39;\\n&#39; )  {  state -&gt; lineNumber ++ ;  }  if  ( isComment )  {  if  ( c  !=  &#39;-&#39; )  {  continue ;  }  c  =  nextChar ();  if  ( c  !=  &#39;-&#39; )  {  continue ;  }  c  =  nextChar ();  }  if  ( c  ==  &#39;&gt;&#39;  ...\n As can be seen, IOKit checks for the  !-- chars, and then correctly advances the pointer by three chars before seeing  -&gt;, which doesn\u2019t end the comment. CF on the other hand only advances the pointer by  two chars, so it parses the second  - twice, thus seeing both  &lt;!-- and  --&gt;. This means that while IOKit considers  &lt;!---&gt; as just the start of a comment, CF considers it as both start and end. After that, we feed both parsers the  &lt;!--&gt;token,  ...\n  After discovering this, I didn\u2019t bother reversing XPC, I simply fed it some test data and observed the results. In this case, it turned out to see the same things as IOKit, which was  perfect for my case. I could sneak entitlements past  amfid using CF, but have them show up when parsed by both IOKit and XPC!\n   &lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-8&#34;?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &#34;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&#34; &#34;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&#34;&gt; &lt;plist  version= &#34;1.0&#34; &gt; &lt;dict&gt;  &lt;???&gt; &lt;!-- ?&gt; &lt;key&gt;task_for_pid-allow&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; &lt;!-- --&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt;\n  These are all less elegant and less rewarding than the first variant, and I\u2019ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure out what parser difference causes those, or how the different parsers react to them.\n One thing to note here though is that, depending on what you use to install IPA files on your iDevice, getting these entitlements to survive that process can be tricky. That is because the entitlements on a provisioned app also contain a team- and app identifier, which at least Cydia Impactor generates randomly every time you sign, and thus has to parse, modify and re-generate the entitlements blob. I don \u2019t know about any of its alternatives, but I \u2019ve  ...\n  From this point forward, it\u2019s simply a matter of picking entitlements. For a start, we can give ourselves the three entitlements in my initial PoC:\n com.apple.private.security.no-container - This prevents the sandbox from applying any profile to our process whatsoever, meaning we can now read from and write to any location the  mobile user has access to, execute a ton of syscalls, and talk to many hundreds of drivers and userland services that we previously weren\u2019t allowed to. And as far as user data goes, security no longer exists.\n  task_for_pid-allow - Just in case the file system wasn\u2019t enough, this allows us to look up the task port of any process running as  mobile, which we can then use to read and write process memory, or directly get or set thread register states.\n  platform-application - Normally we would be marked as a non-Apple binary and not be allowed to perform the above operations on task ports of Apple binaries, but this entitlement marks us as a genuine, mint-condition Cupertino Cookie. :P\n And just in case this entitlement magic wasn\u2019t enough, say we needed to pretend to CF that we have certain entitlements as well, we could easily do that with the three above ones now. All we have to do is find a binary that holds the entitlement(s) we want,  posix_spawn it in suspended state, get the newly created process\u2019 task port, and make it do our bidding:\n task_t  haxx ( const  char  * path_of_executable ) {  task_t  task ;  pid_t  pid ;  posix_spawnattr_t  att ;  posix_spawnattr_init ( &amp; att );  posix_spawnattr_setflags ( &amp; att ,  POSIX_SPAWN_START_SUSPENDED );  posix_spawn ( &amp; pid ,  path_of_executable ,  NULL ,  &amp; att ,  ( const  char * []){  path_of_executable ,  NULL  },  ( const  char * []){  NULL  });  posix_spawnattr_destroy ( &amp; att );  task_for_pid ( mach_task_self (),  pid ,  &amp; task );  return  task ; }\n You can further get some JIT entitlements to dynamically load or generate code, you can spawn a shell, or any of literally a thousand other things.\n There are a mere two privileges this bug does not give us: root and kernel. But for both of those, our available attack surfaces just increased a hundredfold, and I would argue that going to root isn\u2019t even worth it, because you might as well go straight for the kernel.\n But I hope you will understand, dear reader, that losing one 0day is loss enough for me, so of course escalating past \u201cmobile with every entitlement ever\u201d is left as an exercise to you. ;)\n  Given the elusive nature of this bug, how did Apple ultimately patch it? Obviously there could only be one way: by introducing MORE PLIST PARSERS!!!one!\n In iOS 13.4 already, Apple hardened entitlement checks somewhat, due to a bug report  credited to Linus Henze:\n Available for: iPhone 6s and later, iPad Air 2 and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPod touch 7th generation\n While I don\u2019t know the exact details of that bug, based on  a tweet of Linus I\u2019m assuming this had to do with bplist, which, while also exploiting parser differences, wouldn\u2019t have gotten past  amfid. And my bug actually survived the 13.4 fix, but was finally killed in 13.5 beta 3.\n I also don\u2019t know whether it was Linus, Apple or someone else who went on to look for more parser differences, but having two entitlement bugs fixed in two consecutive minor iOS releases feels like too much of a coincidence, so I\u2019m strongly assuming whoever it was drew inspiration from Linus\u2019 bug.\n Apple\u2019s final fix consists of introducing a new function called  AMFIUnserializeXML, which is pasted into both AMFI.kext and  amfid, and is used to compare against the results of  OSUnserializeXML and  CFPropertyListCreateWithData to make sure they are the same. You can still include a sequence like  &lt;!---&gt;&lt;!--&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;in your entitlements and it will go through, but try and sneak anything in between those comments, and AMFI will  ...\n  So while this does technically bump the number of XML/plist parsers from 4 to 6, it does sadly actually mitigate my bug. :(\n  As far as first 0days go, I couldn\u2019t have wished for a better one. This single bug has assisted me in dozens of research projects, was used thousands of times every year, and has probably saved me just as many hours. And the exploit for it is in all likelihood the most reliable, clean and elegant one I\u2019ll ever write in my entire life. And it even fits in a tweet!! Well over 3 years since discovery is not half bad for such a bug, but I sure  ...\n We can also ask ourselves how a bug like that could ever exist. Why the hell there are 4 different plist parsers on iOS. Why we are still using XML even. But I figure those are more philosophical than technical in nature. And while this entire story shows that it might be a good idea to periodically ask ourselves whether the inaccuracies of our mental models are acceptable, or something should be documented and communicated more thoroughly,  ...\n Now, I\u2019ve pumped this post out as soon as I possibly could, so if I\u2019ve left any mistake in here, you have any questions, or just wanna chat in general, feel free to  file an issue, hit me up  on Twitter, or shoot me an email at  *@*.net where  * =  siguza.\n At the time of writing, this bug is still present on the latest non-beta version of iOS. The whole project is available  on GitHub, have fun with it while it lasts!\n And finally, some of the reactions I got of Twitter for all of you to enjoy:", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:04:48", "tags": "ios,\u6c99\u76d2,paper,gt,entitlements", "title": "\u901a\u7075\u7eb8\uff1aiOS\u6c99\u76d2\u9003\u8131", "title_en": "Psychic Paper: iOS Sandbox Escape", "transed": 0, "url": "https://siguza.github.io/psychicpaper/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["ios", "\u6c99\u76d2", "paper", "gt"]}]
