"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  In cryptography, the  dining cryptographers problem studies how to perform a  secure multi-party computation of the boolean-OR function.  David Chaum first proposed this problem in the early 1980s and used it as an illustrative example to show that it was possible to send anonymous messages with unconditional sender and recipient untraceability. Anonymous communication networks based on this problem are often referred to as  DC-nets(where DC stands for &#34;dining  ...\n Despite the word  dining, the dining cryptographers problem is unrelated to the  dining philosophers problem.\n    Three cryptographers gather around a table for dinner. The waiter informs them that the meal has been paid for by someone, who could be one of the cryptographers or the  National Security Agency (NSA). The cryptographers respect each other&#39;s right to make an anonymous payment, but want to find out whether the NSA paid. So they decide to execute a two-stage protocol.\n In the first stage, every two cryptographers establish a shared one-bit secret, say by tossing a coin behind a menu so that only two cryptographers see the outcome in turn for each two cryptographers. Suppose, for example, that after the coin tossing, cryptographer A and B share a secret bit            1    {\\displaystyle 1}  , A and C share            0    {\\displaystyle 0}  , and B and C share            1    {\\displaystyle 1}  .\n  if they didn&#39;t pay for the meal, the  exclusive OR (XOR) of the two shared bits they hold with their two neighbours,\n Supposing none of the cryptographers paid, then A announces            1  \u2295  0  =  1    {\\displaystyle 1\\oplus 0=1}  , B announces            1  \u2295  1  =  0    {\\displaystyle 1\\oplus 1=0}  , and C announces            0  \u2295  1  =  1    {\\displaystyle 0\\oplus 1=1}  . On the other hand, if A paid, she announces            \u00ac  (  1  \u2295  0  )  =  0    {\\displaystyle \\lnot (1\\oplus 0)=0}  .\n The three public announcements combined reveal the answer to their question. One simply computes the XOR of the three bits announced. If the result is 0, it implies that none of the cryptographers paid (so the NSA must have paid the bill). Otherwise, one of the cryptographers paid, but their identity remains unknown to the other cryptographers.\n   The DC-net protocol is simple and elegant. It has several limitations, however, some solutions to which have been explored in follow-up research (see the References section below).\n If two cryptographers paid for the dinner, their messages will cancel each other out, and the final XOR result will be            0    {\\displaystyle 0}  . This is called a collision and allows only one participant to transmit at a time using this protocol. In a more general case, a collision happens as long as any even number of participants send messages.\n Any malicious cryptographer who does not want the group to communicate successfully can jam the protocol so that the final XOR result is useless, simply by sending random bits instead of the correct result of the XOR. This problem occurs because the original protocol was designed without using any  public key technology and lacks reliable mechanisms to check whether participants honestly follow the protocol.  [1]\n The protocol requires pairwise shared secret keys between the participants, which may be problematic if there are many participants. Also, though the DC-net protocol is &#34;unconditionally secure&#34;, it actually depends on the assumption that &#34;unconditionally secure&#34; channels already exist between pairs of the participants, which is not easy to achieve in practice.\n A related  anonymous veto network algorithm computes the logical OR of several users&#39; inputs, rather than a logical XOR as in DC-nets, which may be useful in applications to which a logical OR combining operation is naturally suited.\n  David Chaum first thought about this problem in the early 1980s. The first publication that outlines the basic underlying ideas is his.  [2] The journal version appeared in the very first issue of the Journal of Cryptology.  [3]\n  DC-nets are readily generalized to allow for transmissions of more than one bit per round, for groups larger than three participants, and for arbitrary &#34;alphabets&#34; other than the binary digits 0 and 1, as described below.\n  To enable an anonymous sender to transmit more than one bit of information per DC-nets round, the group of cryptographers can simply repeat the protocol as many times as desired to create a desired number of bits worth of transmission bandwidth. These repetitions need not be performed serially. In practical DC-net systems, it is typical for pairs of participants to agree up-front on a single shared &#34;master&#34; secret, using  Diffie \u2013Hellman  ...\n  The protocol can be generalized to a group of            n    {\\displaystyle n}   participants, each with a shared secret key in common with each other participant. In each round of the protocol, if a participant wants to transmit an untraceable message to the group, they invert their publicly announced bit. The participants can be visualized as a  fully connected graphwith the vertices representing the participants and the edges representing  ...\n  The protocol may be run with less than fully connected secret sharing graphs, which can improve the performance and scalability of practical DC-net implementations, at the potential risk of reducing anonymity if colluding participants can split the secret sharing graph into separate connected components. For example, an intuitively appealing but less secure generalization to            n  &gt;  3    {\\displaystyle n&gt;3}  participants using  ...\n Another compromise secret sharing DC-net topology, employed in the  Dissent system for scalability,  [4] may be described as a  client/server or  user/trustee topology. In this variant, we assume there are two types of participants playing different roles: a potentially large number  n of users who desire anonymity, and a much smaller number            m    {\\displaystyle m}   of  trusteeswhose role is to help the users obtain that anonymity. In  ...\n  Though the simple DC-nets protocol uses  binary digits as its transmission alphabet, and uses the XOR operator to combine cipher texts, the basic protocol generalizes to any alphabet and combining operator suitable for  one-time padencryption. This flexibility arises naturally from the fact that the secrets shared between the many pairs of participants are, in effect, merely one-time pads combined together symmetrically within a single DC-net  ...\n One useful alternate choice of DC-nets alphabet and combining operator is to use a  finite group suitable for public-key cryptography as the alphabet\u2014such as a  Schnorr group or  elliptic curve\u2014and to use the associated group operator as the DC-net combining operator. Such a choice of alphabet and operator makes it possible for clients to use  zero-knowledge prooftechniques to prove correctness properties about the DC-net ciphertexts that  ...\n  The measure originally suggested by David Chaum to avoid collisions is to retransmit the message once a collision is detected, but the paper does not explain exactly how to arrange the retransmission.\n Dissent avoids the possibility of unintentional collisions by using a verifiable shuffle to establish a DC-nets transmission schedule, such that each participant knows exactly which bits in the schedule correspond to his own transmission slot, but does not know who owns other transmission slots.  [8]\n  Herbivore divides a large anonymity network into smaller DC-net groups, enabling participants to evade disruption attempts by leaving a disrupted group and joining another group, until the participant finds a group free of disruptors.  [9] This evasion approach introduces the risk that an adversary who owns many nodes could  selectively disrupt only groups the adversary has not  completelycompromised, thereby &#34;herding&#34; participants  ...\n Dissent implements several schemes to counter disruption. The original protocol  [8] used a verifiable  cryptographic shuffle to form a DC-net transmission schedule and distribute &#34;transmission assignments&#34;, allowing the correctness of subsequent DC-nets ciphertexts to be verified with a simple  cryptographic hashcheck. This technique required a fresh verifiable before every DC-nets round, however, leading to high latencies.

These instructions are somewhat complex (latencycloser to 3 cycles than 1, and often port restricted),and it seems like the sort of problem that would have had efficientsolutions before SSE4 finally graced x86 with a  population count instruction.\n In the context of a sorting library\u2019s partition loop,  popcnt and bsf is probably more than good enough: the post shows that the real issue is branch mispredictionsbeing slower than permuting unconditionally.This is just a fun challenge to think about (:\n  Detecting whether a machine integer is a power of two (or zero) isanother task that has a straightforward solution in terms of popcountor bitscan. There\u2019s also a simpler classic solution to this problem:\n  How does that expression work? Say  x is a power of two. Its binaryrepresentation is  0b0...010...0: any number of leading zeros,  2a single \u201c1\u201d bit, and trailing zeros (maybe none). Let\u2019s see what happens whenwe subtract 1 from  x:\n  The subtraction triggered a chain of  borrowsthroughout the trailing zeros, until we finally hit that 1 bit.In decimal, subtracting one from  10...0 yields  09...9;in binary we instead find  01...1.If you ever studied the circuit depth (latency) of carry chains(for me, that was for circuit complexity theory), you knowthat this is difficult to do well.Luckily for us,  chip makers work hard to pull it off,and we can just use carries as a data-controlledprimitive to efficiently flip ranges of bits.\n When  x is a power of two,  x and  x - 1 have no \u201c1\u201d bit in common,so taking the bitwise  and yields zero. That\u2019s also true when  x is 0,since  anding anything with 0 yields zero. Let\u2019s see what happensfor non-zero, non-power-of-two values  x = 0bxx...xx10..0,i.e., where  x consists of an arbitrary non-zero sequence of bits  xx..xxfollowed by the least set bit (there\u2019s at least one, since  x is neither zero nor a power of two), and the trailing zeros:\n  The leading not-all-zero  0bxx...xx is unaffected by the subtraction,so it passes through the bitwise  and unscathed ( anding any bit withitself yields that same bit), and we know there\u2019s at least one non-zerobit in there; our test correctly rejects it!\n  When decoding variable length integers in  ULEBformat, e.g., for  protocol buffers,it quickly becomes clear that, in order to avoid byte-at-a-time logic,we must rapidly segment ( lex or tokenize, in a way) our byte stream to determine where each ULEBends. Let\u2019s focus on the fast path, when the encoded ULEB fits in amachine register.\n We have  uleb = 0bnnnnnnnnmmmmmmmm...0zzzzzzz1yyyyyyy1...:a sequence of bytes  3 with the topmost bit equal to 1,terminated by a byte with the top bit set to 0,and, finally, arbitrary nuisance bytes ( m...m,  n...n, etc.) we wish to ignore.Ideally, we\u2019d extract  data = 0b0000000000000000...?zzzzzzz?yyyyyyy?... from  uleb: we want to clear thenuisance bytes, and are fine with arbitrary values in theULEB\u2019s control bits.\n It\u2019s much easier to find bits set to 1 than to zero, so the first thing to do isto complement the  ULEB data andclear out everything but potential ULEB control bits (the high bit ofeach byte), with  c = ~uleb &amp; (128 * (WORD_MAX / 255)), i.e.,compute the bitwise  and of  ~uleb with a bitmask of the high bit in each byte.\n uleb = 0bnnnnnnnnmmmmmmmm...0zzzzzzz1yyyyyyy1... ~uleb = 0b\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305...1z\u0305z\u0305z\u0305z\u0305z\u0305z\u0305z0y\u0305y\u0305y\u0305y\u0305y\u0305y\u0305y0... c = 0b\u0305n\u03050000000\u0305m\u03050000000...10000000000000000...\n We could now bitscan to find the index of the first 1 (marking thelast ULEB byte), and then generate a mask. However, it seems wasteful togenerate an index with a scan, only to convert it back into bitmapspace with a shift. We\u2019ll probably still want that index to know howfar to advance the decoder\u2019s cursor, but we can hopefully update thecursor in parallel with decoding the current ULEB value.\n When we were trying to detect powers of two, we subtracted  1 from x, a value kind of like  c, in order to generate a new valuethat differed from  x in all the bits up to and including the firstset (equal to  1) bit of  x, and identical in the remaining bits. Wethen used the fact that  anding a bit with itself yields that samebit to detect whether there was any non-zero bit in the remainder.\n Here, we wish to do something else with the remaining untouched bits, wewish to set them all to zero. Another bitwise operator doeswhat we want:  xoring a bit with itself always yields zero, while xoring bits that differ yields  1. That\u2019s the plan for ULEB. We\u2019llsubtract 1 from  c and  xor that back with  c.\n uleb = 0bnnnnnnnnmmmmmmmm...0zzzzzzz1yyyyyyy1... ~uleb = 0b\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305n\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305m\u0305...1z\u0305z\u0305z\u0305z\u0305z\u0305z\u0305z0y\u0305y\u0305y\u0305y\u0305y\u0305y\u0305y0...c = 0b\u0305n\u03050000000\u0305m\u03050000000...10000000000000000... c - 1 = 0b\u0305n\u03050000000\u0305m\u03050000000...01111111111111111...c ^ (c - 1) = 0b0000000000000000...11111111111111111...\n We now just have to bitwise  and  uleb with  c ^ (c - 1)to obtain the bits of the first  ULEB value in  uleb, whileoverwriting everything else with 0. Once we have that, we can either extract data bits with  PEXTon recent Intel chips, or otherwise dust off interesting stunts for  SWAR shifts by variable amounts.\n  Let\u2019s first repeat the question that motivated this post. We want to detect when a byte  p is one of the following nine values:\n  These bit patterns feel similar to those for power of two bytes: if wecomplement the bits, these values are all 1 less than a power of two(or -1, one less than zero). We already know how to detect when avalue  x is zero or a power of two ( x &amp; (x - 1) == 0), so it\u2019s easyto instead determine whether  ~p is one less than zero or a power oftwo:  (~p + 1) &amp; ~p == 0.\n This is already pretty good: bitwise  not the byte  p,and check if it\u2019s one less than zero or a power of two (three simpleinstructions on the critical path). We can do better.\n There\u2019s another name for  ~p + 1, i.e., for bitwise complementing a value andadding one: that\u2019s simply  -p, the additive inverse of  p in two\u2019scomplement! We can use  -p &amp; ~p == 0. That\u2019s one fewerinstruction on the critical path of our dependency graph (down to two, since we can   test whether  anding yields zero), and still onlyuses simple instructions that are unlikely to be port constrained.\n  CL-USER&gt; (dotimes (p 256) (when (zerop (logand (- p) (lognot p) 255)) (format t &#34;0b~2,8,&#39;0r~%&#34; p)))0b000000000b100000000b110000000b111000000b111100000b111110000b111111000b111111100b11111111\n   I hope the examples above communicated a pattern I often observe whenmangling bits: operations that are annoying (not hard, just a bit morecomplex than we \u2019d like) in the bitmap domain can be simpler in two \u2019scomplement arithmetic. Arithmetic operations are powerful mutatorsfor bitmaps, but they \u2019re often hard to control. Subtracting or adding1 are the main exceptions: it \u2019s easy to describe their impact in termsof the low bits of the bitmap. In fact, we can extend that trick  ...\n If you find yourself wishing for a way to flip ranges of bits in adata-dependent fashion, it\u2019s always worth considering the two\u2019scomplement representation of the problem for a couple minutes. Addingor subtracting powers of two doesn\u2019t always work, but the payoff ispretty good when it does.\n P.S.,  Wojciech Mu\u0142a offers a different 3-operation sequence with  -pto solve damageboy\u2019s problem.That\u2019s another nice primitive to generate bitmasks dynamically.\n   I use the  0b... syntax throughout this post to denote bit literals, similarly to the usual  0x... hexadecimal literals.\u00a0 \u21a9\n While I prefer to work with little-endian bytes, I find everything makes more sense with big-endian bits.\u00a0 \u21a9", "posttime": "2020-05-04 07:28:40", "tags": "\u68c0\u67e5,borrows,uleb,bits", "title": "\u68c0\u67e5\u6309\u4f4d\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u501f\u7528", "title_en": "Check for borrows in bitwise operations", "transed": 1, "url": "https://pvk.ca/Blog/2020/05/02/check-for-borrows-in-bitwise-operations/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u68c0\u67e5", "borrows", "uleb", "bits"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000540, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5728\u75be\u63a7\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u50f5\u5c38\u3001\u50f5\u5c38\u542f\u793a\u5f55\u548c\u50f5\u5c38\u51c6\u5907\u7ee7\u7eed\u6d3b\u7740\u6216\u8d70\u6b7b\u5417\uff1f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u521d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u73a9\u7b11\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u7528\u51c6\u5907\u4fe1\u606f\u5438\u5f15\u65b0\u7684\u53d7\u4f17\uff0c\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7ee7\u7eed\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u50f5\u5c38\u9632\u5907\u201d\u63a5\u89e6\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53d7\u4f17\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eec\u53c2\u4e0e\u5230\u6240\u6709\u707e\u5bb3\u7684\u9632\u5907\u4e2d\u6765\u3002\n\u5916\u9762\u6709\u5404\u79cd\u5404\u6837\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u505a\u597d\u51c6\u5907\u3002\u4ee5\u50f5\u5c38\u542f\u793a\u5f55\u4e3a\u4f8b\u3002\n\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u8bfe\u5802\u4e0a\u6559\u6388\u51c6\u5907\u5de5\u4f5c\u5417\uff1f\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u4f9b\u60a8\u4f7f\u7528\u6216\u9002\u5e94\u60a8\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u3002\n\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6765\u88ad\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u4eec\u8003\u8651\u5e94\u6025\u51c6\u5907\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5236\u4f5c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u50f5\u5c38\u6d77\u62a5\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f15\u8d77\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e3a\u65f6\u5df2\u665a\u4e4b\u524d\u8ba9\u4eba\u4eec\u53c2\u4e0e\u8fdb\u6765\u3002\u4e0b\u8f7dpdf\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e3a\u60a8\u7684\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u6216\u5bb6\u5ead\u6253\u5370\u526f\u672c\u3002\u82f1\u6587CDC-pdf[PDF-27MB]|\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bedCDC-pdf[PDF-2 MB]\u3002\n\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5e94\u6025\u51c6\u5907\u5417\uff1f\u8bf7\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6f2b\u753b\u4e2d\u7bc7\u5c0f\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u50f5\u5c38\u542f\u793a\u5f55\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u51c6\u5907\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4efd\u4e2a\u4eba\u51c6\u5907\u6838\u5bf9\u8868\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u4f60\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9605\u8bfb\u5b8c\u6bd5\u540e\u91c7\u53d6\u884c\u52a8\u3002\n\u8bf7\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u50f5\u5c38\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u9875\u9762\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u60a8\u81ea\u5df1\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u5fbd\u7ae0\u548c\u5c0f\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u6211\u4eec\u535a\u5ba2\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u8f9b\u8fea\u52a0\u548c\u50f5\u5c38\u7535\u5b50\u5361\u7247\u3002", "note_en": "Wonder why zombies, zombie apocalypse, and zombie preparedness continue to live or walk dead on a CDC web site?

What exactly is it? It\u2019s a line of research where scientists take viruses and study how they might be modified to become deadlier or more transmissible. Why would they do this? Scientists who engage in such research say it helps them figure out which viruses threaten people so they can design countermeasures.\n To be clear, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is  definitely not a biologically engineered pathogen. It was not released on purpose, and it is likely to have been  the result of accidental transmission through human contact with wild animals, like almost all disease outbreaks in history have been.\n But the emerging reports about the lab in Wuhan are making many people aware for the first time that gain-of-function research happens at all. I wouldn\u2019t blame you if your response to this news is this:  The government gives grants to researchers to make potentially pandemic viruses deadlier and to make them transmissible more easily between people? Why are we doing that?\n The increased attention to gain-of-function research is a good thing. This kind of highly controversial research \u2014 banned under the Obama administration after safety incidents demonstrated that lab containment is rarely airtight \u2014  began again under the Trump administration, and many scientists and public health researchers think it\u2019s a really bad idea. Our brush with the horrors of a pandemic might force us to reconsider the warnings those experts have been sounding for years.\n  In 2019, Science magazine broke the news that the US government resumed funding two controversial experiments to make the bird flu more transmissible.\n The two experiments had been on hold since 2012 amid a fierce debate in the virology community about gain-of-function research. In 2014, the US government, under the Obama administration, declared a moratorium on such research.\n That year was a bad one on the biohazard front.  In June 2014,  as many as 75 scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were exposed to anthrax. A few weeks later, Food and  Drug Administration officials ran across  16 forgotten vials of smallpox  in storage. Meanwhile, the \u201c largest, most severe, and most complex\u201d Ebola outbreak in history was raging across West Africa, and the  first patient to be diagnosed in the US had just been announced.\n It was in that context that scientists and biosecurity experts found themselves embroiled in a debate about gain-of-function research. The scientists who do this kind of research argue that we can better anticipate deadly diseases by making diseases deadlier in the lab. But many people at the time and since have become increasingly convinced that the potential research benefits \u2014 which look limited \u2014 just don\u2019t outweigh the risks of kicking off the next deadly pandemic ourselves.\n While internally divided, the US government came down on the side of caution at the time. It announced a  moratorium on funding gain-of-function research \u2014 putting potentially dangerous experiments on hold so the world could discuss the risks this research entailed.\n But in 2017, the government under the Trump administration   released new guidelines for gain-of-function research, signaling an end to the blanket moratorium. And the news from 2019 suggests that dangerous projects are proceeding.\n Experts in biosecurity are concerned the field is heading toward a mistake that could kill innocent people. They argue that, to move ahead with research like this, there should be a transparent process with global stakeholders at the table. After all, if anything goes wrong, the mess we\u2019ll face will certainly be a global one.\n  Advocates of this kind of gain-of-function research (not all gain-of-function research uses pathogens that can cause pandemics) point to a  few things they hope it will enable us to do.\n In general, they argue it will enhance surveillance and monitoring for new potential pandemics. As part of our efforts to thwart pandemics before they start \u2014 or before they get severe \u2014 we take samples of the viruses currently circulating. If we know what the deadliest and most dangerous strains out there are, the argument goes, then we\u2019ll be able to monitor for them and prepare a response if it looks like such mutations are arising in the wild.\n \u201cAs coordination of international surveillance activities and global sharing of viruses improve,\u201d some  advocates wrote in  mBio , we\u2019ll get better at learning which strains are out there. Then, gain-of-function research will tell us which ones are close to becoming deadly.\n \u201cGOF data have been used to launch outbreak investigations and allocate resources (e.g., H5N1 in Cambodia), to develop criteria for the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool, and to make difficult and sometimes costly pandemic planning policy decisions,\u201d they argue.\n \u201cThe United States government weighed the risks and benefits \u2026 and developed new oversight mechanisms. We know that it does carry risks. We also believe it is important work to protect human health,\u201d Yoshihiro Kawaoka, an investigator whose gain-of-function research was approved,  told Science magazine.\n According to this logic, if we\u2019d known for years that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus \u2014 the virus now keeping us all indoors \u2014 was a particularly dangerous one, maybe we could have had disease surveillance systems out to alert us if it made the jump to humans.\n Others are skeptical. Thomas Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins, told me last year that he doesn\u2019t think the benefits for vaccine development hold up in most cases. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any of the vaccine companies say that they need to do this work in order to make vaccines,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cI have not seen evidence that the information people are pursuing could be put into widespread use in the field.\u201d\n Furthermore, there are unimaginably many possible variants on a virus, of which researchers can identify only a few. Even if we stumble across one way a virus could mutate to become deadly, we might miss thousands of others. \u201cIt\u2019s an open question whether laboratory studies are going to come up with the same solution that nature would,\u201d MIT biologist Kevin Esvelt told me last year. \u201cHow predictive are these studies really?\u201d As of right now, that\u2019s still an open question.\n And even in the best case, the utility of this work would be sharply limited. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that many countries do not have mechanisms in place at all \u2014 much less a real-time way to identify and reduce or eliminate risks as experiments and new technologies are conceived,\u201d Beth Cameron, the  Nuclear Threat Initiative\u2019s vice president for global biological policy and programs, told me.\n With the stakes so high, many researchers are frustrated that the US government was not more transparent about which considerations prompted them to fund the research. Is it really necessary to study how to make H5N1, which causes a type of bird flu with an eye-popping mortality rate, more transmissible? Will precautions be in place to make it harder for the virus to escape the lab? What are the expected benefits from the research, and which hazards did the experts who approved  ...\n \u201cThe people proposing the work are highly respected virologists,\u201d Inglesby said. \u201cBut laboratory systems are not infallible, and even in the greatest laboratories of the world, there are mistakes.\u201d What measures are in place to prevent that? Will potentially dangerous results be published to the whole world, where unscrupulous actors could follow the instructions?\n These are exactly the questions the review process was supposed to answer, but didn\u2019t.\n  The reason the subject of gain-of-function research can inspire such heated opposition is because the stakes can be so high. Pathogens have escaped labs before.\n  In 1977, the last case of smallpox was diagnosed in the wild. The victim was Ali Maow Maalin of Somalia. The World Health Organization tracked down every person he\u2019d been in face-to-face contact with to vaccinate everyone at risk and find anyone who might have caught the virus already. Thankfully, they found no one had. Maalin recovered, and smallpox appeared to be over forever.\n That moment came at the end of a decades-long campaign to eradicate smallpox \u2014 a deadly infectious disease that killed about 30 percent of those who contracted it \u2014 from the face of the Earth. Around 500 million people died of smallpox in the century before it was annihilated.\n But in 1978, the disease cropped back up \u2014 in Birmingham, England.  Janet Parker was a photographer at Birmingham Medical School. When she developed a horrifying rash, doctors initially brushed it off as chicken pox. After all, everyone knew smallpox had been chased out of the world \u2014 right?\n Parker got worse and was admitted to the hospital, where testing determined she had smallpox after all. She died of it a few weeks later.\n  It turned out that the building Parker worked in also contained a research laboratory, one of a handful where smallpox was studied by scientists who were trying to contribute to the eradication effort. Some  papers  reported the lab was badly mismanaged, with important precautions ignored because of haste. (The doctor who ran the lab  died by suicideshortly after Parker was diagnosed.) Somehow, smallpox escaped the lab to infect an employee elsewhere in the building. Through  ...\n In 2014, as the Food and Drug Administration did cleanup for a planned move to a new office,  hundreds of unclaimed vials of virus samples were found in a cardboard box in the corner of a cold storage room. Six of them, it turned out, were vials of smallpox. No one had been keeping track of them; no one knew they were there. They may have been there since the 1960s.\n Panicked scientists put the materials in a box, sealed it with clear packaging tape, and carried it to a supervisor\u2019s office. (This is not approved handling of dangerous biological materials.) It was later found that the integrity of one vial was compromised \u2014 luckily, not one containing a deadly virus.\n The 1979 and 2014 incidents grabbed attention because they involved smallpox, but incidents of unintended exposure to controlled biological agents are  actually quite common. Hundreds of incidents occur every year, though not all involve potentially pandemic-causing pathogens.\n In 2014, a researcher accidentally contaminated a vial of a fairly harmless bird flu with a far-deadlier strain. The deadlier bird flu was then shipped across the country to a lab that didn\u2019t have authorization to handle such a dangerous virus, where it was used for research on chickens.\n The mistake was discovered only when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted  an extensive investigation in the aftermath of a different mistake \u2014 the potential exposure of 75 federal employees to  live anthrax, after a lab that was supposed to inactivate the anthrax samples accidentally prepared activated ones.\n The CDC\u2019s Select Agents and Toxins program  requires \u201ctheft, loss, release causing an occupational exposure, or release outside of primary biocontainment barriers\u201d of agents on its watchlist be immediately reported. Between 2005 and 2012, the agency got 1,059 release reports \u2014 an average of one incident every few days. Here are a few examples:\n In 2008, a  sterilization device malfunctioned and unexpectedly opened, exposing a nearby unvaccinated worker to undisclosed pathogens.\n In 2009, a  new high-security bioresearch facility \u2014 rated to handle Ebola, smallpox, and other dangerous pathogens \u2014 had its decontamination showers fail. The pressurized chamber kept losing pressure and the door back into the lab kept bursting open while the scientists leaned against it to try to keep it closed. Building engineers were eventually called to handle the chemical showers manually.\n In 2011, a worker at a lab that studied dangerous strains of bird flu found herself unable to shower after a construction contractor accidentally shut off the water. She removed her protective equipment and  left without taking a decontaminating shower. (She was escorted to another building and showered there, but pathogens could have been released in the meantime.)\n Now, the vast majority of these mistakes never infect anyone. And while 1,059 is an eye-popping number of accidents, it actually reflects a fairly low rate of accidents \u2014 working in a controlled biological agents lab is safe compared to many occupations, like trucking or fishing.\n But a trucking or fishing accident will, at worst, kill a few dozen people, while a pandemic pathogen accident could potentially kill a few million. Considering the stakes and worst-case scenarios involved, it\u2019s hard to look at those numbers and conclude that our precautions against disaster are sufficient.\n Reviewing the incidents, it looks like there are many different points of failure \u2014 machinery that\u2019s part of the containment process malfunctions;  regulations aren\u2019t sufficient or aren\u2019t followed. Human error means live viruses are handled instead of dead ones.\n Now imagine such an error involving viruses enhanced through gain-of-function research. \u201cIf an enhanced novel strain of flu escaped from a laboratory and then went on to cause a pandemic, then causing millions of deaths is a serious risk,\u201d Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, told me last year.\n The cost-benefit analysis for pathogens that might kill the people exposed or a handful of others is vastly different from the cost-benefit analysis for pathogens that could cause a pandemic \u2014 but our current procedures don\u2019t really account for that. As a result, allowing gain-of-function research means  running unacceptable risks with millions of lives.

"note_en": "A coronavirus antibody test that is more than 99% accurate has been authorized for emergency use in the US, the Swiss drugmaker Roche  said Sunday.\n The test boasts a 100% sensitivity rating and a 99.8% specificity rating, which is much higher than many of the initial antibody tests to reach market, and could significantly reduce the potential for false positives.\n Antibody testing is considered a key step toward reopening the country, as it would offer a better understanding of how widespread the virus is and who may be immune to it.\n However, there has still been no definitive study showing having antibodies means people are immune from getting infected. Researchers also do not yet know how long-lasting any antibody protection is for this new virus.\n   US regulators  authorized Sunday emergency use of a coronavirus antibody test that is more than 99% accurate, addressing concerns about high false positive rates that have plagued some of the first tests.\n The test is made by Roche, a Swiss giant in the pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries. Roche said Sunday it will boost its manufacturing to produce &#34;high double-digit millions per month&#34; of the test.\n Antibodies are proteins created by the body&#39;s immune system to fight invading threats, like viruses or bacteria. Antibody testing is seen by many as a critical step into reopening the economy. Some have floated ideas of using the tests to issue some form of &#34;immunity passports,&#34; which could allow people with the antibodies to return to work.\n Roche stated the test has a 100% sensitivity rating and a 99.8% specificity rating, which are significantly higher than some of the first antibody tests that were cleared for use in the US. The results came from using more than 5,000 samples on its test.\n   It will take about 18 minutes to process a single test, with Roche&#39;s devices able to run up to 300 tests per hour in an automated fashion, the company said.\n One recent study found several of these tests  are less than 90% accurate. Combined with Roche&#39;s ability to mass-manufacture millions of tests, this new test should help address the issue of false positive results, where a test may tell someone they have the antibodies when they actually do not.\n Another medical diagnostics giant, Abbott, has been using its antibody test for the past few weeks in the US. Abbot says its test  is 99% accurate, based on testing about 1,000 samples.\n    Even if fully accurate, antibody testing still faces several\u00a0critical unknowns that may limit the usefulness of these tests.\n First, it is not yet known for sure that having antibodies equals protection. For most viruses, having antibodies means  being protected from future infections. But studies have yet to be done on the novel coronavirus proving this to be the case, and there have been  some reports of potential reinfection.\n Even if antibodies give a degree of protection from the virus,  researchers do not know how long that protection will last. This could be another critical limitation if antibody protection lasts for months instead of years.\n Finally, it is still unknown what percentage of the US or world population has already been infected with the coronavirus. Reliable and widespread antibody testing can help answer this question.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 07:06:09", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u6297\u4f53,antibody", "title": "\u4e00\u79cd\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc799%\u7684\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u6297\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u73b0\u5728\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6279\u51c6", "title_en": "A coronavirus antibody test that is more than 99% accurate is now cleared in US", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/antibody-test-that-is-more-than-99-accurate-gets-emergency-clearance-by-fda-2020-5", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u6297\u4f53", "antibody"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d7cc4ce2648e2935261df65c590b006c.png", "infoid": 1000537, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "01.\u3002Alif Alif\u9884\u5148\u4e0d\u6536\u53d6\u4efb\u4f55\u8d39\u7528\u3002\u5165\u95e8\u662f\u514d\u8d39\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6211\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u6708\u8d39\u3002\n03.\u3002\u5f53\u60a8\u5b9e\u9645\u6536\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba2\u5355\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4f1a\u5458\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u53ea\u9700\u6536\u53d6\u5c11\u91cf\u4f63\u91d1\u3002\n04.\u3002\u968f\u7740\u4f60\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u9500\u552e\u989d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4f63\u91d1\u4f1a\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u4f4e\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u4f60\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u589e\u957f\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "note_en": "01.

videos showing such mysterious objects on Monday.\n The ministry will consider procedures to respond to, record and report encounters, but the unknown nature of such objects may confuse Self-Defense Forces pilots, including those of F-15 fighter jets.\n The videos released by the U.S. Defense Department, taken in 2004 and 2015, show an elliptical flying object.\n Japanese Defense Minister Taro Kono said Tuesday that SDF pilots have never encountered UFOs, but he added that the ministry will set protocols to cover the possibility.\n According to the ministry, Air SDF fighter jets from seven bases located from Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa Prefecture in the south are scrambled to monitor and identify aircraft of unknown nationality.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 06:44:02", "tags":

"note_en": "By now it is difficult to imagine that once there was a time when the utility, and even the possibility, of recursion in programming was in doubt. Yet that was true of the programming community around 1960. Even the committee that was to create Algol 60 was divided on the issue. How recursion got into the language is a story of intrigue and misunderstandings. I came across this story for the first time when reading Gauthier van den Hove\u2019s excellent MSc thesis [ 11]. It is also the subject of Chapter  ...\n  In the late 1950s a committee was formed to design a universal, machine-independent programming language. Such a language was not a superfluous luxury at the time: programmers were using programming systems provided by the hardware manufacturers that were not even uniform across the different models. Fortran was the first exception, but was at the time still tied to a single manufacturer. Lisp was a harbinger of things to come: machine-independent and not tied to a manufacturer. This is what  ...\n McCarthy, fresh from the success of his Lisp project, was enthusiastic about recursion as an elegant way to get computers to do what they are best at: repeat execution of the same code with suitable modification each time around. In fact, the first Lisp had no iteration, so that the only way to add all elements of a linear list was to write a recursively defined function. As a member of the Algol committee he proposed making the possibility of recursion a feature of the new language. The proposal  ...\n There were plenty of reasons to be opposed. It was not clear whether it could be implemented: a flaky academic experiment like the Lisp interpreter was not an authoritative example for the solid, efficient compiler that the German faction of the committee had in mind. But committee members Naur and van Wijngaarden agreed with McCarthy that recursion was too tempting an opportunity to be missed. Van Wijngaarden had been egged on by his sidekick Edsger W. Dijkstra, who was in favour of recursion  ...\n Naur was the committee member editing the final version of the Algol report. Two decades later Naur remembered it as follows [ 1]:\n The last substantial change of language concepts was the admission of recursive procedure activations. This took place as follows. [ \u2026] [O]n about February 10, [ \u2026] I had a telephone call from A. van Wijngaarden, speaking also for E.W. Dijkstra. They pointed to an important lack of definition in the draft report, namely the meaning, if any, of an occurrence of a procedure identifier inside the body of the declaration other than in the left part of an assignment. They also made it clear that  ...\n It turned out that there  was \u201ctrouble over the question\u201d. Several committee members had been tricked into approving a final version of the report that included an easily overlooked late addition that settled the controversy in the direction opposite to their wish. Committee member F.L. Bauer registered his protest by characterizing the addition of recursion to the language as an \u201cAmsterdam plot\u201d [ 1, Appendix 5].\n That this was not paranoia on the part of Bauer is made clear by Dijkstra in an interview in 2001 [ 2]:\n Recursion was a major step. It was introduced in a sneaky way. The draft ALGOL-60 report was circulated in one of the last weeks of December \u201959. We studied it and realized that recursive calls were all but admitted, though it wasn \u2019t stated. And I phoned Peter Naur \u2014that call to Copenhagen was my first international telephone call, I \u2019ll never forget the excitement! \u2014and dictated him one suggestion with the suggestion that he include it. It was something like \u201cAny other occurrence of  ...\n But what was it that Bauer did not and that Dijkstra did implement? Indeed what does \u201crecursion\u201d mean? A closer look at the above testimonies of Naur and of Dijkstra shows that one speaks of \u201crecursive procedure activations\u201d, a runtime concept, whereas Dijkstra speaks of \u201crecursion\u201d, which can be interpreted as a property of source programs.\n  It is possible that during execution a procedure is called for which there exists an activation record of an earlier call.\n Calls to self, directly or indirectly, possibly through calls to procedures that are named as formal parameters.\n Calls to self, directly or indirectly, or indirectly through calls to procedures that are not named as formal parameters.\n  When the Bauer faction of the Algol committee discovered that they were victims of the Amsterdam Plot, it seemed a simple matter to define their preferred version of Algol: remove the offending sentence. They discovered that this did not eliminate recursion. At least not recursion according to meaning 1. And this is what they wanted to remove because they wanted static allocation of procedure activation records.\n The publication of the Algol-60 report was followed by several attempts to redefine the language: SMALGOL [ 3], the ECMA subset [ 4], and SUBSET Algol [ 5]. These are united in their desire to disallow programs that need dynamic allocation of procedure activation records. All three are unanimous in deleting the last sentence of Section 5.4.4 of the Algol-60 report. They are agreed that this is not enough to banish the spectre of recursion, but have different attempts in this direction.  ...\n No call of the procedure itself may occur during the execution of the statements of the body of any procedure, nor during the evaluation of those of its actual parameters, the corresponding formal parameters of which are called by name, nor during the evaluation of expressions occurring in declarations inside the procedure.\n I understand the Algol-60 report, but not this sentence. The SUBSET people supply an alternative formulation for people like me:\n  As Dijkstra had already foreseen, they should have added: \u201cAnd don\u2019t try to do anything sneaky with procedure parameters.\u201d. This way one of the achievements of the Algol 60 was lost: a single document for the implementer and for the user.\n One effective cure against recursion is to eliminate nested procedure declarations and to require a procedure to be declared before the first call to it. We see this for example in C, which has been characterized as \u201cglorified assembler language \u201das a result of being that paragon of efficiency that the Bauer faction valued above all. The irony is that the designer of this paragon of efficiency saw no problem in dynamically allocating procedure activation records nor in allowing  ...\n Of course we cannot blame the Bauer faction for not having the experience of later workers in the field. It is interesting that in 1960 there did exist knowledge that indicated how difficult it is to avoid the need for dynamic allocation when one wants the attractive procedure mechanism of Algol. This procedure mechanism is similar to that of lambda calculus, which was known since the 1930s. It  seemsclear in its compact definition that lambda calculus does not allow recursive  ...\n The lambda calculus is another example of how difficult it is to avoid recursion once one has a simple and general function definition mechanism. Again, one cannot blame the Bauer faction for not knowing these things. Indeed the use of the Y combinator for recursion did not become widely known until the 1970\u2019s with the publication of books such as [ 7].\n And it is safe to assume that the perpetrators of the Amsterdam plot did not know either. How is it then that they were so sure that they were on the right track? In the case of one of the plotters, E.W. Dijkstra, we do know. In October 1961 he published Mathematical Centre report MR 34 \u201cOn the Design of Machine-Independent Programming Languages\u201d [ 8]. In this paper Dijkstra proposes general principles for language design that he considered relevant at the time and that, it  ...\n In one of the most cited papers in all of computing, F.P. Brooks [ 9] contrasts programming systems or languages that have fanatical adherents to a bunch of ho-hum items that, though perhaps useful, do not. He notes that the former were created by individuals, the latter by committees. By implication he suggests that committee-designed artefacts are necessarily in the ho-hum category. Brooks identifies the distinguishing criterion as  conceptual integrity. Brooks places Algol  ...\n I went out for a second opinion, and found this, by Dijkstra [ 10, page 4]:\n And then the 60s started with an absolute miracle, viz. ALGOL 60. This was a miracle because on the one hand this programming language had been designed by a committee, while on the other hand its qualities were so outstanding that in retrospect it has been characterized as \u201ca major improvement on most of it successors\u201d (C. A. R. Hoare).\n How did the miracle happen? How was it possible for a large committee, of varying membership, which is what the Algol committee was, to dramatically advance the state of the art and then come up with a document that is terse, complete, and describes a language with conceptual integrity, that quality prized so highly by Brooks?\n The answer is that there was a gestation period that began with the International Symposium on Automatic Computing held in October 1955 in Darmstadt. Several speakers proposed the need of  a single universal, machine-independent, algorithmic language. The first of a succession of committees started work on this. Contact was sought, and found, with like-minded workers in the United States. It was a joint European/US committee that met in Z\u00fcrich and agreed on criteria for  ...\n Publication of this report aroused interest in further development of the language. Peter Naur was among the new members that joined the Algol committee. Algol 58 was in need of further development. Many new ideas were proposed. In several ways the committee was advancing beyond the most advanced existing ideas and beyond their own intellectual grasp.\n And the committee was floundering. Naur, though the new kid on the block, saw the need for a structured discussion medium and created the Algol Bulletin. He started to consolidate results in the form of a language definition. He studied Backus \u2019s formalism for syntax definition and applied it to the overburdened syntactic wish list for the new language. And got it ready just in time for handing out at the final design conference in January 1960 in Paris. No time for  ...\n  \u2026 explains one of the strange incidents of the Paris ALGOL-60 Conference \u2026 were surprised by Peter Naur handing them out at the beginning of the Paris Conference his 18 pages draft Report. Peter Naur had not been commissioned to do so, it was a  fait accompli. It therefore sounds poetic if he has written that his draft Report was \u2018chosen \u2019as the basis of the discussion; the Committee was simply forced to do so, after Peter Naur had gained this advantage. Likewise, he  ...\n  It should be mentioned, however, that there was not only scepticism among the Committee members, but also resignation that there was nothing one could do when the Editor did arbitrarily change the outcome of the Conference: it was to be swallowed for the sake of loyalty.\n  On the other hand, this situation has certainly helped to get a draft of the Report finished in spite of the very tight time schedule of the six day Paris Meeting.\n This explains the miracle: after the creative, explorative, and floundering stage of the Algol enterprise, the new kid on the block appears, and takes over. The old guard vaguely recognizes that he rescues the enterprise, but does it ever  hurt. Bauer, for one, may never have forgiven Naur; the spite quoted above was written in 1978, long after the events. To me they indicate the extent to which Algol 60, the \u201cmiracle\u201d, was Naur\u2019s creation.\n In summary, let me justify the lurid subtitle: \u201cA tale of intrigue, betrayal, and advanced programming language semantics \u201d. There was intrigue: van Wijngaarden and Dijkstra phoning Naur with the intention of getting him to make (what they thought) a crucial change to the Algol 60 report. There was betrayal of trust, because they intended the change to settle unobtrusively an issue that they knew was controversial and they knew that there was a high probability  ...\n  Until recently I did not realize there was a distinction between recursion and the possibility of multiple activation records for the same procedure. Similarly, I assumed that Peter Naur was just another member of the Algol committee, who happened to be editor. It is only because Gauthier van den Hove kindly showed me some of the results of his research that I learned the fascinating story that appears here.

"note_en": "Disruptions, downturns, and recessions make the weak weaker and the strong stronger. It was true centuries ago, and it is true today.\n The 2001 downturn turned telecom and cable giants into the Internet\u2019s gatekeepers. Microsoft emerged victorious with its Internet Explorer. During the 2008 financial crisis, when cash was king, the big banks \u2014 JP Morgan Chase, for example \u2014 became more prominent and more pervasive. In a similar fashion, the present pandemic is making big tech bigger. And it is not just that their coffers are overflowing coffers. They suddenly have a much larger and more receptive audience.\n Last week, we saw the mid-pandemic report record results for Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook. Spoiler alert: they\u2019re not exactly suffering. Microsoft saw its revenues go up to $35 billion for the quarter, compared to $30.5 billion for the same quarter in 2019. Amazon\u2019s revenues came in over $75 billion. Even with a shutdown, Apple reported earnings of $58 billion. You get the drift.\n Even with worsening economic conditions over the next year or so, these companies are likely to come out big winners. Though, the upshot is not just that a handful of companies will become a more significant presence in our lives. This will be true of technology in general. Sure, there might be some companies \u2014 AirBnB, for example \u2014that suffer in the near term. The startup ecosystem might contract. But overall, this is a big moment for technology, and it\u2019s only going to get bigger.\n If you live long enough, you experience enough downturns to develop at least one of two things: mental resilience or post-traumatic stress disorder. I now need at least two hands to count on my fingers the number of downturns I have experienced. These experiences have largely supported my blind faith in the power of the network and the inevitability of technology. This time around is no different.\n Over the past few months, we have experienced the mainstreaming of technology-enabled behavior previously thought of as being on the fringe. Shopping for groceries online and having them delivered, for example, was something of coastal luxury. Now, it has been experienced and used by millions across the country. Instacart has boasted of hiring another 250,000 shoppers. Amazon is hiring an additional 175,000 delivery people. Food-on-demand services are going through a boom like none other \u2014Doordash  ...\n In a conversation this week, Wired editor Nicholas Thompson marveled at the growth in telemedicine and online education, two technologies (for lack of a better term) that have been around for so long that we often overlook them. Khan Academy has seen 20 times as many registrations. The Silicon Valley investors who viewed remote work and the distributed company as a net negative, and penalized companies that didn\u2019t have a physical presence in their backyard, are now \u201cwork from home\u201d gurus.\n Zoom has 300 million daily participants (which is not the same as users), while Slack has seen as many as 10 million simultaneously connected users. Microsoft\u2019s Slack competitor, Teams, now has more than 75 million daily active users. No matter what, most companies have now experienced \u201cworking from home,\u201d and they are unlikely to just return to their old ways. Once we get accustomed to new behaviors, it is hard for us to go back\n Before technology became so pervasive in the lives of everyday people, it was a luxury for corporations, educational institutions, and governments. Servers, switches, big databases, and productivity software didn \u2019t impact most of us very much. The personal computers were great, but they only sold a mere hundred million units at their peak, and a big chunk of those went to the buyers mentioned above. The Internet changed all that. Technology became us, and we became technology. If anything,  ...\n Just as the productivity gains that were expected of big companies became commonplace in mid-sized operations over the past two decades, we have seen the convenience-of-technology flow downwards. What was \u201cproductivity\u201d for corporations and organizations has morphed into \u201cconvenience\u201d for us normals.\n The economic downturn at the beginning of the millennium saw the emergence of broadband connectivity and its pervasiveness. Seven years later, we all embraced the social web, and then the mobile and app revolution. And as the pandemic ravages our social fabric, we are seeing a wholesale digital transformation in a compressed time frame. Each economic setback creates a craving for convenience, and in the long-term, this opens the door for the widespread adoption of technology.\n Whether we like it or not, we are addicted to it now. We like being able to watch movies and television shows when we want, where we want, and on the screen we want. We love ordering food and groceries and want them delivered. Ironically, the consumer-focused services have been much more prepared for the future than the enterprises, which have been slower in embracing the significant shift to cloud, data, and automation.\n But not anymore! Kicking and screaming, they have been brought into the future. \u201cWe have seen two years\u2019 worth of digital transformation in two months,\u201d noted Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a call with Wall Street analysts after reporting earnings that were just shy of astounding. Box CEO Aaron Levie noted that \u201cyears of IT acceleration being compressed into months.\u201d\n Levie also quipped that he had spoken to \u201cmultiple Fortune 500 CIOs in the past two days who have been implementing a fundamentally different IT strategy than they would have had a year ago. \u201dThey are all thinking more cloud, more digital, and more automation. Others have observed this shift in perspective. In a call with investors, ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott noted that the pandemic has been an accelerant for digital transformation, which has now become a business imperative.

"note_en": "As a founder, there comes a time when you need a business plan, complete with financial forecasts, income statements, and fancy graphs that will impress your investors.\n  A financial model allows you to draft financial projections easily, fast, and in a professional manner. A great template will also force you to think through all the aspects of your project and make sure you really get the financial logic behind your business.\n  This post compares the top 12 templates of financial models for SaaS startups. I have personally tested each model. I have ranked them on 40+ items along 5 categories. I&#39;ve looked at both spreadsheets and SaaS apps, and both free and paid solutions.\n         I compared 40 points across 5 categories: (a) financial statements, (b) analysis capabilities, (c) revenue modeling, (d) cost modeling, (e) extra features. A detailed analysis of each model is available below. In each case, I tested the software/spreadsheet myself.\n  Time scale: Are the statements over 1 year, 3 years or more? You usually want 3 years as a minimum when you speak with professional investors.\n  Income statement: Does the template include an income statement? You usually want a monthly income statement, at least for year 1.\n  Financial analysis: Number of typical financial metrics included e.g. breakeven point, quick ratio, average inventory, etc.\n  SaaS analysis: Number of typical SaaS metrics included e.g. MRR growth, SaaS magic number, CAC/LTV, etc.\n    Costs by P&amp;L category: Does the template break down costs into P&amp;L categories (CoGS, RD, G&amp;A, etc.)\n  Costs by departments: Does the model break down costs into departments (sales, marketing, CS, engineering, etc)\n      VS Actuals: Does the template allow you to run your model versus your actual numbers?\n  New client acquisition: How do you enter new clients into the model? Possibilities include: entering a number manually for each month or year (it sucks); autofill the model from a base number and a growth rate (sucks a bit less); autofill several streams - each stream represents a different type of client e.g SMB/enterprise (better); or even fully model each acquisition channel (the best, very rare)\n  Offerings: How many offers can you define and how precisely can you model them? This includes the possibility to create one-off offers, recurring offers, or a combo, but also the possibility to create introduction times and end times for specific offers.\n  Pricing model: How many pricing models can you define and how precisely: tiers (free, basic, premium), revenue models (per seat, per usage, etc), automatically increase or decrease the plans price over years.\n      Service revenue: Can you model punctual service revenue on top of all the other pricing models and offerings?\n  Enterprise specific: Does the template offer specific features to model complex enterprise sales, such as landing/expansion, custom product developments, various sales cycles, etc?\n  Direct labor costs: The best templates allow you to correlate direct labor costs with relevant metrics. For example, your sales staff is calculated based on forecasted income and sales target per account executive. Same for customer success payroll with number of customers and workload target per CS staff.\n  Direct non-labor costs: just like with labor costs, the best templates allow you to link some direct non-labor costs with relevant metrics. For instance, server costs can be a % of MRR.\n  Indirect labor costs: same as above. Even for indirect costs, some templates find smart ways to tie them to some aspect of the business.\n    Payment terms: Can you define the payments terms with your vendors and suppliers? May be useful if there is a hardware component to your offer.\n  Hardware-friendly: This is a special mention for templates that model things like shipping costs, inventory delay, etc.\n  Documentation : Is there proper documentation in the model and on the website? Are there good explainer videos? What kind of direct support (chat, email) comes with the template?\n    Third-party integration: Third-party integrations can be useful to input or update data over time, or to display advanced graphs.\n  Excel spreadsheet: Can you access your financials as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet? This is a must if you need to share it with investors.\n  Google Sheets: Does the model work in Google Sheets? Not all models that work in Microsoft Excel work in Google, so you may want to consider that point.\n  Editable formulas: Some templates do not allow you to modify formulas - which is a massive bummer when it comes to customization.\n Granted, it&#39;s not a perfect methodology. One could argue forever about whether cap tables should be included in a financial model for startups. But it&#39;s the best I could come up with - without being a finance nerd myself :)\n     Affiliation: Some links in the article are affiliated - which means that if you end up buying a template through one of those links, I&#39;ll get a few $$$. This doesn&#39;t cost you anything, and allows me to keep writing useful articles for you.\n  Impartiality: Regardless of whether there is a referral in place or not, I am committed to providing you with an honest opinion. I take great pride in being an independant, honest, and trusted source of information for entrepreneurs.\n  Non finito: This is a non-finite work. I am happy to update the article if you bring new, relevant information to my knowledge. I am also happy to fix any mistake or clarify any confusion that you may find in the article.\n     For years, this template has been the go-to financial model for French entrepreneurs. However, it didn&#39;t age well.\n Analysis capabilities are limited: only a handful of financial metrics, zero SaaS metrics, a couple of graphs, and it&#39;s impossible to categorize costs. Modeling, be it for revenue or costs, is all too basic and requires a lot of manual input. Also, it&#39;s entirely in French.\n Having said that, it remains a free-of-charge, easy-to-use, easy-to-customize template that covers all the basics while including specificities to the French ecosystem such as CIR, JEI, etc.\n This model makes a lot of sense for French entrepreneurs looking for a simple solution. For the others, keep on reading.\n        This template was built by SaaS apostle Christoph Janz, and you can tell. It packs a punch of SaaS knowledge in a sleek, clear spreadsheet. You&#39;ll find lots of good stuff: basic/pro/enterprise plans, churn/upgrade/downgrade, an elegant client acquisition model and a wealth of graphs and charts.\n It&#39;s not all rosy, though. You want a 5 years forecast? No, you only need 2. You want to sell annual pro plans? Too bad, pro plans are monthly and that&#39;s that. Also, no balance sheet.\n This template works great if you are a typical SaaS startup and fits the vision that Christoph put into his financial plan. If not, you may be better off considering templates with broader horizons.\n        This one got updated just before publishing the article, so I have to scratch my old review and write a new one. I&#39;ll take care of that soon enough.\n       This template published by Ben Murray, AKA the SaaS CFO, has a lot in common with Chris Janz&#39;s model: it&#39;s free, it&#39;s SaaS-centric and it&#39;s really good overall.\n  Cost modeling: Janz does a much better job as many costs are tied to activity metrics. With Murray, you have to fill it all manually. Janz 1 - 0 Murray\n  Commitment: Murray allows you to define which plans are annual and which are monthly. Janz does not. Janz 1 - 1 Murray\n  Client acquisition: Murray wants you to manually input new clients each month, where Janz includes 3 acquisition channels. Janz 2 - 1 Murray\n  Murray also allows you to add service revenue and offers up to 5 years of forecasts. Janz 2 - 2 Murray\n  Since its latest update, Murray&#39;s model also allows you to input your actual number and compare them with your forecasts. Janz 2 - 3 Murray\n At the end of the day, Murray&#39;s SaaS template is great - maybe the best amongst the free templates. It is a bit disappointing when it comes to modeling new client acquisition and costs, though.\n        Because you&#39;re paying, you obviously get a lot more in return: balance sheet, cap table, GAAP/IFRS compliance, 161 currencies to choose from, a ton of financial metrics and graphs, and advanced capabilities to model your costs and your revenue, including for hardware startups.\n Now, because we are paying, we are a lot pickier. And I see 3 problems with this SaaS Startup Kit. First, you cannot account for upgrades and downgrades (you can model churn, though). Second, you cannot break down costs by P&amp;L categories or departments. Third, the formulas are &#34;locked &#39; so you cannot edit them. That&#39;s a big problem if, like me, you like looking under the hood. But maybe you don&#39;t care?\n     All in all, I cannot tell you not to look at the SaaS startup kit. It has a lot going for it, and at $99, it&#39;s priced right. But if you can stretch your budget a little more, look at the next model - it may well be the right one.\n     Let me start right off the bat: this &#34;SaaS Financial Model&#34; by Taylor Davidson is one of the best templates out there.\n For $149, you get all the financial statements you may wish for, laid out over 5 years, and GAAP-compliant. Additional tabs are built-in for fundraising (assess needs and uses), valuation (ownership, DCF, waterfall exit, ROI), variants (simplified scenarios), and impact (for purpose-driven startups). Bonus point: the model works in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, supports all currencies, and is fully editable.\n In terms of analysis capabilities, the template generates boatloads of financial and SaaS metrics, as well as 20+ beautiful graphs. Costs can be broken down by departments and P&amp;L categories so you can make sense of all that good stuff. SaaS experts will especially appreciate the granularity provided by monthly cohort analysis - a rarity!\n Modeling revenue and costs is extremely versatile. Instead of pre-modeling everything for you, the template provides you with very unique features (Pricing, Pipeline, Drivers) that allow you to customize it to your needs. Here are a few examples of what you can do:\n Contract length is not limited to monthly or annual but can be anything you want.\n  Billings are separate from contract cycles, so can do an annual contract with quarterly billings, or 3-year contract with annual billings, or annual contract with monthly billings\n  All costs, direct and indirect, labor and non-labor, can be tied to relevant activity metrics (revenue, headcount, etc.) which is what you would expect from this kind of template.\n  All costs can also be tied that are *not* tied to an activity metric, say periodic costs that occur quarterly or annually, or costs that increase a % over time, or costs that are a % of salaries, or a % of revenues, for example. This is all built-in within the Drivers sheet and an absolute delight to use.\n  For Enterprise sales, you can model a good old Pipeline in the Pipeline sheet and attribute different numbers of seats and &#34;likelihood to close&#34; to each deal.\n True, it takes a bit of time to wrap your head around the internal logic of that model. But once you master it, there is virtually no limit to what you can do.\n Thankfully, this financial model is well-documented. The website includes a long, detailed &#34;Getting Started&#34; page as well as specific articles and videos for technical points. The highlight is definitely the email support - I&#39;ve consistently received detailed replies within 24 hours - at zero extra cost. Kudos to that.\n Long story short - if you are willing to shell out $149 for a SaaS financial model, Taylor Davidon&#39;s template is arguably one of the absolute best you can get your hands on. The other one is the model built by Alexander Jarvis - read on to learn about it.\n        It&#39;s hard to write a serious review about this template - everything about it is absolutely ridiculous. It is ridiculously rich, ridiculously detailed, ridiculously powerful. It&#39;s the kind of template that you use when you want to make a statement, like impress your investors or make your CFO feel irrelevant. It&#39;s heavy, bold, and over-the-top, in the best way possible. Brace yourselves, let&#39;s dive in.\n This template by Alexander Jarvis comes in 2 versions. The &#34;SaaS: SME &amp; Users&#34; is perfectly fine for most SaaS businesses. It sells at $319. The &#34;SaaS: Enterprise, SME &amp; Users&#34; retails at $1,299 and includes extra logic to model enterprise sales. Because of their complexity, both models only work in Microsoft Excel (no Google Sheets).\n  Each acquisition channel is modeled in great details: paid, organic, blog, social, emailing, and channel partners. Each channel can be assigned its own conversion rate from visitor to user. You can also differentiate between the customers that self-onboard and those who require sales intervention.\n  You can design composite offerings based on usage fee, monthly fee and/or a one-time service fee. The templates allow 3 paid plans - typically basic, premium, pro - as well as a free trial plan, and each of these plans can exist with a monthly or annual commitment.\n  Customers can upgrade, downgrade or churn, and you can even schedule module releases at different points in time, so you create new revenue streams over the years.\n  All costs, direct and indirect, labor and non-labor, are modeled in a clever way i.e. they are tied to relevant activity metrics\n I cannot stress enough how detailed this model is. Here is an example: the &#34;email marketing&#34; tab (yes, there is such a thing) takes into account 12+ inputs including stuff like the % of recipients who will share the newsletter with their friends. I love this kind of detail because it gives actionable points when thinking about execution. It also makes it easier to defend your numbers in front of investors because you can explain the underlying  ...\n If you buy the $1,299 version, you get an extra slew of tabs specifically dedicated to enterprise sales in all its complexity: enterprise-specific products and offerings, geographies, sales cycles, &#34;land and expand&#34;, custom development, etc. If you are building the next Oracle or Palantir, that stuff alone is invaluable.\n Documentation is ok. Instructions and comments are included inside the template, but not much in terms of FAQ/articles on the website. Having said that, I particularly appreciated the tutorial videos: one 28-min overview and 20 shorter videos that each cover a specific tab.\n You want more? Time to talk about analysis capabilities. Alexander Jarvis&#39; model is most lavish when it comes to that point. 50+ graphs are readily available - and that&#39;s without counting the sparklines that are peppered throughout the sheet. Because modeling is so detailed, the template can provide advanced SaaS metrics such as marketing leverage or expansion % of new MRR. Of course, costs can be allocated to P&amp;L categories and departments  ...\n When it comes to financial statements, the $319 version gives you only 3 years of forecasts, with no balance sheet and no cap table. The $1,299 version does a bit better with 5-year forecasts, but still no sign of balance sheet nor cap table. Some would argue that an early-stage startup doesn&#39;t need formal financial statements... However, this template does include a tab to compare your forecasts to your actuals, and another tab listing down industry  ...\n If you want the best spreadsheet ever, it boils down to comparing Taylor Davidson&#39;s and Alexander Jarvis&#39; templates, and picking the one that fits you the most. See the final section &#34;Conclusion&#34; for a side-by-side of both models.\n    However, some prefer using a specialized SaaS app to build your financial model. If that&#39;s your case, check out the last 4 models.\n     The Finance Navigator was developed by Alexander Matthiessen and Wout Bobbink from EY&#39;s Dutch office. It&#39;s a SaaS app: you pay a monthly subscription to access an online tool. It&#39;s a fundamentally different approach from the spreadsheet-based models we&#39;ve explored so far.\n The Finance Navigator costs $30 per month without commitment or $380 over an 18 month period. For that price, you get very exhaustive financial statements: income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets over 10 years - no cap table though. All currencies are available and you can export the statements to a clean, well-designed spreadsheet format (only numbers, no formulas).\n Documentation is good, with in-app guidance, website posts, a Q&amp;A, and a 37 min walkthrough video. The tool was clearly thought to be user-friendly and the onboarding is best-in-class. You will have zero difficulties using EY&#39;s Finance Navigator whatsoever.\n Unfortunately, simplicity is a double-edged sword. Revenue and cost modeling is super basic. For example, revenue is defined as a base number for month 1, then a monthly growth rate. No channels, no conversion rate, no pricing plans. The same goes for costs: you cannot tie costs to specific activity metrics, so you have to input them manually. Because it&#39;s a SaaS application, you cannot customize the model by adding fields or modifying  ...\n At the end of the day, EY&#39;s Finance Navigator holds a lot of promises. UX is great and they have a couple of nice features like comparables and scenarios. The product has evolved over the years, adding up features and getting more usable. In my estimation, it&#39;s not quite enough to be used by advanced SaaS entrepreneurs. The product is geared towards traditional businesses - think bakery, restaurant, consulting, who just want clean  ...\n        Liveplan sells its financial modeling SaaS app at $20 per month ($360 over 18 months), which makes it a close competitor to EY Finance Navigator.\n Starting with the strong points, Liveplan offers exhaustive statements over 5 years: income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets. Compared with EY&#39;s model, you have a bit more control over revenue modeling: offerings can be defined as recurring fees, billable hours, and a one-time upfront fee can also be added. Pricing can be increased automatically over time, churn can be factored in, and you can model monthly or annual  ...\n When looking at cost modeling, you can adjust payment terms for clients and suppliers. There are also specific variables for hardware products. Documentation is just fine, with a tutorial video per section embedded directly in the app, as well as plenty of instructions. Liveplan exists in 5 languages, and integrates with Quickbooks, which allows importing your actual numbers and comparing them with your forecasts. You can also export your  ...\n Now, although Liveplan&#39;s software has more powerful modeling capacities than EY&#39;s, it remains insufficient in my estimation. Here are just a few examples.\n Direct labor costs can be set as a % of revenue, but do not update the number of employees accordingly.\n  Indirect costs can only be set as a constant, a % of overall revenue, or a % of a specific revenue.\n  New client acquisition is just manual input - as in you manually input &#34;2&#34; clients in March and &#34;4&#34; clients in April. There is no channel modeling whatsoever.\n When modeling is too superficial, it translates into poor analysis capabilities. In Liveplan&#39;s case, you do have a dozen financial metrics available (net cash flow, account payable, cash on hand\u2026) and another dozen graphs. But SaaS metrics are absent, which is a bummer for SaaS entrepreneurs.\n At the end of the day, LivePlan was built for non-tech entrepreneurs. Perfect for a bike shop owner, but not quite there for SaaS people.\n Don&#39;t take my word for it: there is a 60-day trial, so give it a spin for free and make up your own mind.\n        Summit is a young startup (founded 2019) that brings a fresh take on the whole financial modeling thing with a SaaS solution.\n Let&#39;s make it clear - Summit is not meant for fundraising. Forecasts on Summit are made for an 18-month period only. Costs cannot be allocated to P&amp;L categories and departments, nor can you differentiate between labor/non-labor or direct/indirect costs. Therefore, you won&#39;t be able to generate any financial statements that your investors may require . Hell, you can&#39;t even export a spreadsheet!\n So why talk about Summit? Because Summit is pretty awesome when it comes to piloting your SaaS startup with a financial model. Here is how it works. First you connect your live metrics (Stripe, Baremetrics, etc.) to your Summit account. This allows Summit to derive your future growth from the current trends. The next step consists in optimizing that future growth. To do that, you define a baseline scenario around 20+ metrics from  ...\n Summit is still a young product and there is room for improvement: currencies, tax rates, expansion and contraction of existing clients, one-off revenue. In particular, client acquisition would greatly benefit from more granularity and native integrations with social media accounts for instance.\n At the end of the day, Summit is not meant to build financial statements, but to make decisions in a data-driven way. It&#39;s such a refreshing approach in the space that I highly recommend trying it out. Bonus point: it&#39;s 100% free for now, so it&#39;s a no-brainer.\n        At first glance, Causal seemed very similar to Summit. It&#39;s also a SaaS solution, also founded in 2019, also bringing a new approach to modeling. But that&#39;s where the comparison stops because the philosophy behind Causal is quite unique.\n Causal is not just a financial modeling tool for SaaS startups. It&#39;s a modeling tool that aims at replacing Excel for every modeling need you may have. This means that (a) Causal is super versatile and goes much deeper than Summit, and (b) Causal is much more complex with a steeper learning curve than Summit.\n Looking at revenue and cost modeling, you can model anything you want on Causal with an interface that&#39;s 10x more modern and user-friendly than a spreadsheet. The same thing goes for analysis capabilities: you can generate dashboards, tables, and graphs for absolutely anything - including any financial statement your investors may want. You can also connect live data sources (Stripe and Google Sheets for now, more to  ...\n As a SaaS entrepreneur, you don&#39;t have time to build a model from scratch. Lucky you, Causal has built-in templates - including two SaaS models built by Taylor Davidson himself (see template #6). You are then able to augment or fine-tune those models to suit your specific needs.\n In terms of documentation, there are a few videos, a live chat as well as a walkthrough when you start a new model. That&#39;s not much, but Causal assumes that you are a modeling &#34;nerd&#34; and that your usual work environment is massive spreadsheets. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;ll be just fine. Assuming you have the time and desire to put in the hours to learn a new tool, Causal may very well be the ultimate  ...\n         If you want a &#34;good enough&#34; model but are not willing to pay for it, go for  Ben Murray&#39;s (model #4) or  Chris Janz&#39;s (model #2). Customize them a bit to offset their weaknesses.\n     If you want the best financial model spreadsheet out there and are willing to pay for it, go for  Taylor Davidson&#39;s (model #6) or  Alexander Jarvis&#39; (models #7/#8). They are by far the best stuff on the market today.\n     If you want to experience the future of financial modeling, go for  Summit (model #11) or  Causal (model #12) - while keeping in mind that both are very different.\n    Thanks for reading. Don&#39;t hesitate to leave a question in the comments, I try to reply personally to each one of them.", "posttime": "2020-05-04 05:37:11", "tags": "\u8d22\u52a1,financial,\u6a21\u578b,model",

Individuals, including directors, have the potential to become liable, as well.\n  Many popular CARES Act funding programs \u2014like the PPP and EIDL programs \u2014require an applicant company to make eligibility certifications. For example, the PPP loans require a certification that \u201cthe uncertainty of current economic conditions makes necessary the loan request to support the ongoing operations of the eligible recipient. \u201dThe SBA further clarified that \u201cBorrowers must . . . [take] into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity  ...\n  VB Transform 2020 Online - July 15-17, 2020: Join leading AI executives at VentureBeat&#39;s AI event of the year.  Register today and save 30% off digital access passes.\n There has obviously been a spate of news stories about well-resourced companies obtaining PPP funding (e.g. Ruth\u2019s Chris, Shake Shack). But in the  VC and startup community, clients are questioning whether a VC-backed startup really \u201cneeds \u201dthe money. This isn \u2019t just a moral question. Given the certification described  ...\n  What happens if a company makes false certifications to obtain CARES Act stimulus funding? The answer is found under the False Claims Act.\n The False Claims Act provides for civil and criminal liability for \u201cknowingly\u201d submitting a false claim to the federal government \u2014 including a request for a government loan.\n Merely submitting a false claim is not enough. It must be \u201cknowingly\u201d false. But there need not be a specific intent to defraud.\n False Claims Act liability arising from the CARES Act is not just a theoretical concern. The Department of Justice has already issued  a press release asserting that it will be prioritizing investigations of COVID-19 related fraud. So, attention and resources are being put into ferreting out CARES Act fraud.\n The government isn\u2019t the only one that can sue you for a false claim\n It\u2019s not only the government that one needs to worry about. A member of the public can stand in the government\u2019s shoes and file a suit under the False Claims Act. This is called a  qui tam action.\n Why would someone bring a qui tam claim under the False Claims Act? Because it can be worth a lot of money. A private plaintiff in a qui tam action may be able to keep up to 30% of the recovery in the lawsuit, plus an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The rest of the recovery goes to the government.\n The plaintiff\u2019s bar has already started advertising for whistleblowers to come forward for the obvious purpose of bringing a slew of qui tam actions under the CARES Act.\n  The False Claims Act doesn\u2019t limit liability to just the applicant company. It can extend to directors as well as investors.\n And remember \u2014 lots of startups are cash poor. Investors, however, are often not. Thus, VCs and other investors make attractive targets with big pockets for plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers seeking to file qui tam actions.\n Let\u2019s focus on two important aspects of False Claims Act liability for VCs and other investors.\n First, is the notion of \u201csubmitting\u201d a false claim. You might think that given the potential liability an investor faces when a startup seeks CARES Act funding that the best thing to do is to insert yourself in the process. This might not have the desired result.\n You are not automatically liable under the False Claims Act just because the company becomes liable. In fact, knowledge of the company submitting a false claim isn \u2019t even enough to impose personal liability. Rather, the individual must have taken some affirmative steps to cause the company to submit the  ...\n This has different implications for VCs themselves vs. directors who may be appointed by a VC.\n Investors are not generally expected to have any role in deciding whether to seek government funding. So, from a liability avoidance perspective, there is a strong case to be made to stay out of it.\n For investor directors, it is more difficult to close your eyes and let the company do what it wants to do. That can raise fiduciary duty concerns. But the job of a director is to make sure the company has policies and procedures in place for the officers to make decisions on government funding, not to  ...\n Second, there is the knowledge element of a False Claims Act claim. The False Claims Act is not a strict liability statute, nor does it seek to punish negligence. To be liable, the government (or a private plaintiff in the government\u2019s shoes) must show that the defendant acted \u201cknowingly.\u201d\n As an investor director, you want to make sure you can demonstrate, at a minimum, that you have acted reasonably and in good faith. In that regard, documentation is always recommended.\n In addition, make sure you are consulting with legal counsel in ensuring compliance with federal funding requirements. This is a particularly key when dealing with facing potential False Claims Act litigation. Reliance on advice of counsel can be, in itself, a defense to a claim that you violated the  ...\n  For many investors, this guidance may be seen as coming too late \u2014 their portfolio companies already obtained stimulus loans when perhaps they weren\u2019t really eligible. Thankfully, the SBA has provided a solution.\n Any company that has received a PPP loan can return the loan in full by May 7, 2020. This safe harbor will allow companies to avoid liability for having obtained a loan when they were potentially ineligible.\n Mital Makadia and David Siegel are partners at  Grellas Shah LLP, where

It\u2019s easy to throw stones after an event that \u201cno one could have foreseen\u201d.\n OK, then today I\u2019d like to do some  Sunday morning quarterbacking. I\u2019d like to ask you guys whether we are prepared for other black swans. Let\u2019s start with a collapse of the electrical system due to solar flares or electromagnetic pulse attacks.\n   In testimony before a Congressional Committee, it has been asserted that a prolonged collapse of this nation\u2019s electrical grid\u2014through starvation, disease, and societal collapse\u2014could result in the death of up to 90% of the American population.\n Well that caught my attention. It sounds worse than being cooped up for a few months watching lots of Netflix films.\n HV transformers are the weak link in the system, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has identified 30 of these as being critical. The simultaneous loss of just 9, in various combinations, could cripple the network and lead to a cascading failure, resulting in a \u201ccoast-to coast blackout\u201d.\n If the HV transformers are irreparably damaged it is problematic whether they can be replaced. The great majority of these units are custom built. The lead time between order and delivery for a domestically manufactured HV transformer is between 12 and 24\u2009months, and this is under benign, low demand conditions.\n OK, I think I understand what needs to be done\u2014stockpile some of these transformers that cannot be quickly replaced.\n Ordered today, delivery of a unit from overseas (responsible for 85% of current American purchasing) would take nearly 3\u2009years. The factory price for an HV transformer can be in excess of $10 million\u2014too expensive to maintain an inventory solely as spares for emergency replacement.\n Yes, $300 million dollars for a stockpile of 30 HV transformers is far too expensive to prevent 90% of the public dying and the rest reduced to cannibalism.\u00a0 Too much for a government that spends  trillions of dollars with about as much care as a drunken sailor spending his wages in a red light district.\u00a0 Instead, let\u2019s buy another    F-22 jet fighter.\n  Obviously I\u2019m no expert here, and I expect commenters will tell me why I\u2019m wrong.\u00a0 Perhaps the very same commenters who told me that I was foolish to think that surgical masks would provide any protection.\n BTW, this isn\u2019t one of those once in 60 million year events like dinosaur-killing asteroids; a huge solar flare hit Earth in 1859.\n Update:\u00a0 I forget to mention that I\u2019m far more worried about accidental

"note_en": "This past week \u2019s horrific announcement from the UN \u2019s World Food Program that up to 250 million people may be facing starvation from the economic impact of COVID-19 should permanently change the conversation about the pandemic. Up to now, we \u2019ve looked to scientists for guidance. Our public health experts have told us we need to shut down social, community and economic life to win this battle. Now as the pressure grows to resume normal life, many insist we wait for experts to give us a scientific  ...\n Beginning in January, epidemiologists began warning of a pandemic which, left unchecked, could lead to millions of deaths around the world. They were right and their warning was an invaluable service to society. Unfortunately, many of these experts have been since asked to make recommendations that ranged well beyond their area of expertise.\n While quarantines of the infected have long been an effective means of impeding disease, shutting down the healthy \u2014and the global economy \u2014at this scale is utterly unprecedented. It is the equivalent of prescribing to the entire population a highly toxic untested drug with massive side effects. Epidemiologists know viruses, but have no special expertise in agriculture, supply chains, labor markets, fiscal policy, social fabric, mental health, education, family relations, national security, or  ...\n The highly influential Imperial College\u2019s report \u2014 briefly \u2014 acknowledged these obvious limitations. Yes, proposed shutdown will entail \u201c enormoussocial and economic costs \u201dwhich may themselves create \u201csignificant impact on health and well-being. \u201dBut since the report \u2019s authors had no capacity to measure these potentially overwhelming costs, they ignored them. Science may not have to worry about trade-offs, but policy \u2014and health care \u2014always does: to save the village, we must first be careful  ...\n As the world watched the terrifying impact of COVID-19 on northern Italy in March, the pressure to do something big was inevitable. But the shutdown of major economies itself has been a worldwide calamity of historic proportions. Education, social, and cultural life have essentially stopped. In the US alone, 26 million people have lost their livelihoods and millions of families are seeing their fragile financial security imperiled \u2014a level in line with the Great Depression. The long-term impact  ...\n Despite the massive human costs of the shutdown \u2014 and a better if still very incomplete understanding of the virus \u2014 public health experts keep doubling down on their initial strategy. Several experts have warned that we may need to continue shutdowns \u2014 turned on and off like a spigot \u2014 for years.\n It \u2019s bizarre: this highly toxic drug that was considered unavoidable when epidemiologists worried about COVID-19 case fatality rates of 2 \u20133% is somehow equally unavoidable even though the range now looks more like 0.5 \u20131.0%. Alternative targeted mitigation ideas initially considered impractical \u2014such as quarantining the most vulnerable and focusing resources on nursing homes \u2014are somehow still impractical even though it \u2019s now clear deaths are heavily concentrated, and that society is willing  ...\n Our news media \u2014and the echo chamber of social media \u2014has been fully bought in to apocalyptic estimates and only one plausible \u201cscientific \u201dsolution. No anchor dares mention that this pandemic is likely to increase US deaths in 2020 by less than 4%. Presumably, reporters know that the chance of a healthy person dying from this virus is very small \u2014yet grim analysts insist that standing only five feet apart, walking your dog, or going to vote is \u201crisking death. \u201dPundits revel in false dichotomies:  ...\n All this has proven very good for TV ratings. But it\u2019s been terrible for helping the public understand the relative risks of this pandemic.\n Proponents are so bought into shutdown that they seem to have forgotten its original rationale. Shutdown was designed to \u201cflatten the curve, \u201dspreading infections over a long enough time period to prevent surge demand at any time on the health care system. Shutdown was intended to defer some of the pain of the pandemic, not eliminate it. An alternative strategy of encouraging rapid herd immunity accepts the risks of worse short-term results in hopes of a quicker end to the pandemic. By definition,  ...\n Developments have undermined the very premise of shutdown: to save the lives of COVID-19 sufferers by limiting surge demand on the health care system. Taking nothing away from the bravery and commitment of health care professionals, we now realize medical care has only limited ability to reduce COVID-19 deaths. Even worse, the shutdown is harming the tens of millions unable to get effective treatment for non-COVID conditions, and by decimating revenue, likely causing long-term damage to  ...\n In the media, shutdown has somehow morphed from a temporary, emergency response into a long-lasting bridge to an \u201call-clear \u201dHollywood ending. Public health experts who should know better haven \u2019t used their platforms to discourage such magical thinking. Perhaps, if we wait, we \u2019ll see a medical treatment for those with severe symptoms. Or an effective vaccine. Currently, the hope is that a broader testing regime will allow for a phased re-opening. Any of those would be great developments,  ...\n We will end the shutdown not because the virus is no longer a threat; we will end it because we can \u2019t continue such toxic treatment. Of course, ending the shutdown will increase risk of infections growing again, but that itself isn \u2019t a sufficient reason to maintain our current policy. As individuals, we make trade-offs between life and mortality every day, in our eating and exercising habits, our career decisions, our choices of fun. Half of us don \u2019t get flu shots each year, and that  ...\n It may be years before we can make a judgement on the overall wisdom of shutdown as our initial tool for attacking this virus. But whatever the strategy\u2019s theoretical merits, it is unsustainable and unrealistic among actual human beings.\n So, what should our public health experts do to treat the patient and not just the virus? First, they can encourage us to maintain the many social distancing techniques short of suppression that individuals and communities can use to reduce transmission. Second, as our knowledge of this virus and its transmission evolves, they can be creative about finding more targeted mitigation approaches. This requires opening up debate on alternatives with an eye to finding acceptable trade-offs,  ...\n Most importantly as we end these unsustainable shutdowns, our experts can give us perspective. Even though we don \u2019t have a way to end this pandemic today, we will almost certainly develop better public health and medical interventions. These innovations take experimentation and time, and we \u2019re more likely to find them if we don \u2019t simultaneously burden ourselves with massive economic and social problems. COVID-19 is likely to be with us for a while and it will be painful.
