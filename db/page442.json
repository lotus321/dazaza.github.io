But don&#39;t worry - Lyft is still moving forward in Oakland, and is here to help you get to where you need to go during this time.&#34;\n Lyft has also permanently shut down its operations in  Austin and  San Jose. The decision to shut down permanently in Austin came after Lyft temporarily removed the scooters in mid-March and then brought them back in early April to better serve essential workers.\n Moving forward, Lyft scooters will only be available in Denver, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Monica and Washington, D.C., according to the company&#39;s site. Right now, Lyft&#39;s operations in Miami are still paused.\n Lyft is not the only scooter operator that has been affected during the pandemic. Lime and Bird, for example,  have both paused operations in certain markets. Bird has also similarly faced financial troubles during these times. In March,  Bird laid off about 30% of its workforce.\n But even before the pandemic, Lyft had ceased scooter operations in a number of cities. In November, for example,  Lyft ended its operations in Nashville, San Antonio, Atlanta, the Phoenix area, Dallas and Columbus. At the time, Lyft also laid off 20 employees.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:47", "tags": "\u7ed3\u675f,ends,\u6ed1\u677f\u8f66,lyft", "title":

"note_en": "Last year researchers at Princeton and the University of Chicago   published the results of a study  on so called \u201cdark patterns\u201d. Dark patterns are tactics online businesses use to manipulate users to do things that will make the business more money.\n For example, email capture popups that cannot be minimized or recurring billing schemes that are nearly impossible to cancel.\n While the research concluded they are generally effective, overly aggressive use can cause a backlash that erodes trust and hurts your brand. Some of these tactics might soon be illegal if the   Deceptive Experiences to Online Users Reduction Act  becomes law.\n All this got me thinking about opposite tactics that make me trust a business more. I will call them anti-dark-patterns. Here are a few:\n      Recently, we had to hold one of regular meetups online due to the corona virus. As I already used Zoom for virtual meetings, I looked into using their webinar solution. It was a one-time event and I did not need a recurring webinar solution, so I treaded cautiously to avoid being locked into a forever billing scheme if I forgot to cancel.\n Guess what? They had an option for just one month (see image above), which I checked. I immediately felt that this is a company I could trust. Most others would never offer this option, or if they did, it would be in tiny print at the bottom of the page\u2014or worse yet, require you to go through customer support.\n Later that week, someone on a large forum I belong to asked about webinar solutions. Due to my positive experience, I instantly recommended Zoom to more than 2,000 members. I suspect this kind of word of mouth referral based on trust (as well as product simplicity) has contributed a lot to Zoom\u2019s hockey stick curve growth (they were doing well even before the corona virus).\n     Closely related to 1) above is letting a free trial user know that they will be billed, a few days before the billing date. One company with a 7-day free trial took it even a step further: while letting me know I would be billed soon, they said something along the lines of  \u201cjust in case you need extra time, we\u2019ve thrown in two more free days. You will be billed on the 9  th  day\u201d.  Something about this made me want to pay for at least a month. Before, I was on the borderline.\n     When you buy plane tickets on Google, the headline price shown is the same price at Checkout. This\n makes me trust Google and in the last few years I have not bought my tickets anywhere else!\n  For example, below is a headline price of $197 for a round-trip ticket from Seattle to Dallas:\n      When I click through to the checkout page, it is actually 80 cents cheaper at $196.20. Most importantly, they already included all the taxes and fees in the headline price.\n      Contrast this approach with Pandora\u2019s, when selling concert tickets alongside the current song playing. About a year ago, while listening to a  Boyz II Men song, I noticed an ad for a tour date in Seattle. Intrigued by the low price, I clicked through. By the time I got to the checkout, the price had ballooned to almost 30% to 40% more, with all the taxes, surcharges, convenience fees and god-knows-what other fees! I have never again clicked on a concert ticket sale ad on Pandora.  ...\n      Many a time I have opted in for a free report or eBook only to be hounded by daily emails. I unsubscribe immediately, as I suspect many others do. Unless you are explicitly a daily newsletter kind of business, this is too much email for a new list member to handle.\n  To piggyback on the courtship analogy often used in marketing, it is like going from first date to showing up at her door every day asking if she is ready to do it! You will quickly turn her off, whereas if you had taken it a little slower, a meaningful relationship might have developed.\n    I recall a story told by   Derek Sivers  (I think) about a company that sold music CDs by emailing their list once or twice a week with a recommendation. It was a nice profitable business ran by music enthusiasts who cared about recommending the most relevant CDs for different musical tastes.\n  Then they got acquired and the investors figured: If you make a million a year emailing twice a week, we can make at least three times as much by emailing daily. They gave the marching orders, \u201cfrom now on, send a daily email\u201d. With the original musician owners gone, the suits recommended random CDs which resulted in fewer sales despite a higher email frequency.\n  And in less than a year they were out of business! The listed got burned out from the aggressive promotions and most people no longer opened the emails or simply unsubscribed.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:41", "tags":

"note_en": "While auto-correct frustrates every iPhone user at one time or another, I imagine it\u2019s an insanely complex feature to get right. After using it for 13 years now, I find that I have a list of  small things I\u2019d love to see change rather than a few number of really  big changes.\n I wanted to make this more a list of suggestions that to just rip into auto-correct. Note that I can always keep a very close eye on the completion bar but to have to look at three possible spellings as I type a word is cumbersome.\n  Auto-correct likes to outsmart us by choosing a more common word than we actually typed.\n In some cases, it might be a welcome surprise, but I feel it\u2019s outweighed by the frustration when it changes my valid word. If I really meant the more common one, I can fix it myself and the system will learn over time that it\u2019s a word I use.\n  One variation on this is adding an ending to a valid word. For example, I typed \u201cflummox\u201d (a valid word) and it auto-corrected it to \u201cflummoxed\u201d, probably because it\u2019s a more commonly used word.\n 2) When an auto-capitalized correction is retyped by the user, don\u2019t preserve capitalization\n This is pretty close to the top of my list. Here\u2019s what happens.\n      Auto-correct capitalized \u201cChicago\u201d for me, which is wonderful. But when I changed my sentence, it capitalized the word \u201cWhere\u201d inappropriately. Note you can double-tap \u201cChicago\u201d to get around it, but text editing can be fiddly so I usually just backspace.\n  Note that you can turn off auto-capitalization, but it\u2019s nice to just have the first word capitalized in a sentence and also proper names like Chicago.\n  When I tap the space bar, I sometimes tap it too high and hit a letter in the row above. I\u2019d love auto-correct to see that I\u2019m typing real words, but intermixing c, v, and b in with them. For example:\n    Especially when I\u2019m typing a long word, I use the completion bar more to save time. But many times, it\u2019ll have forms of the word that aren\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for. For example, if I want to type \u201cflummoxes\u201d so I start typing \u201cflummo\u201d and note I don\u2019t get what I want for suggestions.\n  I\u2019m not a UI designer, but I\u2019d love to tap and hold on \u201cflummox\u201d in the completion bar and it would show all the different available forms (singular, plural, tenses, parts of speech). For a long word or one that is difficult to type, it would save time to make sure I type it correctly.\n 5) The hidden \u201cReplace\u2026\u201d the feature works so well; why doesn\u2019t auto-correct use it?\n A lot of people don\u2019t know this, but if you have a misspelled word and it is underlined, you can double-tap on it, choose Replace\u2026 (if present) and you\u2019ll get a number of suggestions.\n In my experience, the suggestions are really, really good and since it\u2019s underlined, they are words that auto-correct couldn\u2019t figure out.\n So why is it that this \u201cReplace\u2026\u201d feature seems to be\u2026 better?\n   If you type 100 words of text, how many words are auto-corrected wrong? I don\u2019t know the answer, but I\u2019d guess about 10. It\u2019s very tedious to fix a bad auto-correction. One way that few people know about is you can use Undo.\n If you don\u2019t mind shaking your phone violently and risking damage, this is a great option. Another might be an Undo button that perhaps appears briefly on screen after an auto-correction takes place. Or squeeze it into the completion bar.\n   Sadly, note that the Undo feature is extremely buggy. Sometimes it highlights the word and the previous space. Other times it highlights everything from 2 corrections ago to the current cursor position.\n  Sometimes I type a whole paragraph, read it over, then realize that there were a number of bad auto-corrections. I think it would be nice if auto-corrected words would be highlighted, either for a short period of time, or until you are finished typing.\n This would allow you to catch errors in context rather than much later. Also, it\u2019ll help identify words that may be more likely to be incorrect depending on your typing style.\n One specific case where this would be useful is where it corrects words earlier than the one you last typed. Typically, your eyes are on the current word and it\u2019s hard to notice things changing before that.\n This works nicely with the Undo feature mentioned above. Imagine hitting Undo multiple times to cycle through auto-corrected words you need to fix.\n  I don\u2019t know how this would work but I find myself wanting a way to temporarily turn off auto-complete. Maybe I\u2019m speaking with someone where we make up words or use words in a subject area that the dictionary is not familiar with. Perhaps we use a lot of acronyms.\n As far as user interface, I don\u2019t know how you would pull this off but I think it\u2019s an interesting idea.\n 9) Make completion bar more obvious what is going to happen when tapping space or return\n I find the completion bar really useful in certain cases, but due to its interface that relies on the typical Apple grey on slightly lighter grey background, I find it hard to understand what the completion bar is supposed to do. There are at least three states I know of.\n     3&gt; I\u2019m going to replace what you typed with the word circled in a slightly lighter grey\n  Since the two \u201ccolors\u201d match the keyboard exactly, I think it\u2019s hard to easily notice #2 and #3 especially. It\u2019s a lot faster to type if you know it\u2019s already guessed your word completely versus it has an idea but is not sure yet, so you need to type more.\n  The original purpose of auto-correct was to correct fat-fingering the keyboard. So, if I type nanana instead of banana, it found a word based on the fact that \u201cn\u201d and \u201cb\u201d are adjacent to each other.\n Nowadays, machine learning is all the rage, and the goal is often to be smarter than the user and choose words it thinks the user meant based on popularity or usage in the past or trending on Twitter.\n For fun, I typed the word \u201ckerfuffle\u201d but I accidentally type \u201ckeffuffle\u201d\u2014a one character difference between two adjacent keys. What does it suggest? Keep. If machines are supposed to learn, this one hasn\u2019t learned that much!\n   When typing fast, sometimes I type a word and a character is missing. I find that auto-correct works well when the typed word is longer, but not shorter. I go back to my \u201ckerfuffle\u201d example. If I type \u201ckerfffle\u201d which is missing the \u201cu\u201d it doesn\u2019t even suggest an alternative.\n I\u2019m no expert, but a word that has 8 out of 9 characters in common and in order at least deserves to be in the suggestions bar.\n  One of the biggest sources of frustration, confusion, embarrassment, and relationship breakups is misinterpreted auto-corrected text.\n I\u2019ll save the best idea for last (in my opinion). What if the recipient could see auto-corrected text highlighted in the message from you! Then if something were weird or unclear, they would know it\u2019s not actually what you typed.\n  1&gt; You could have a way for the recipient to see what was originally typed\n 2&gt; The sender could quickly send a message to the effect of \u201cI said A but really meant B\u201d without having to type all that text\n   As I said at the start, auto-correct is a far harder technology to crack than most people realize. I consider my suggestions to be anywhere from simple to moderate to implement, with a few impossible ones thrown in.\n I think they would do a good job of improving the user experience of auto-correct and make people enjoy using it rather than getting frustrated by it sometimes.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:29", "tags": "\u66f4\u6539,auto,\u5355\u8bcd,word", "title":

"note_en": "There \u2019s nothing that epitomises the attitudes of pre-Revolutionary France quite like the job of executioner. The men in this job served the royal will, dealing out death and torture as decreed by the upper classes. Officially they were esteemed for this role. Unofficially they were despised for it. The aristocrats saw them as tools to be deployed against the lower classes to keep them in line, but they also saw them as members of those lower orders. And so, when the Revolution came, an executioner  ...\n  Like the  Pierrepoints, the Sansons made executions a family trade. This wasn\u2019t really a coincidence. It was difficult to get men to join the ranks of  les Bourreaux, and so the law said that if an executioner could not find an apprentice then his son or son-in-law would have to take their place. The first of them to take up the trade was an impoverished nobleman named Charles Sanson de Longval. He married the daughter of an executioner, either for love (family legend said that she was his nurse after  ...\n The daughter who Charles married died giving birth to their son, also named Charles. This Charles grew up to take on his father \u2019s job, and married a formidable woman named Anne-Marthe. Charles junior died in 1726, leaving behind a seven year old son named Charles-Jean-Baptiste and a five year old son named Nicolas-Charles-Gabriel. Officially Charles-Jean-Baptiste was now the state executioner for Paris, a lucrative position and one that Anne-Marthe Sanson had no intention of giving up. So the  ...\n  Charles-Henri learned at an early age that his family trade was one held in contempt by the world at large. By common arrangement it was never discussed by them at home, and the Sansons only ever spoke of \u201cthe work \u201d. In order to safeguard him from the disgrace of \u201cthe work \u201d, young Charles-Henri was enrolled anonymously at a fairly prestigious school run by the Sisters of Providence of Rouen. There he studied medicine, hoping to be able to escape his family trade. Unfortunately at the age of  ...\n  Initially, like his father, Charles-Henri had to leave the actual executions to \u201cassistants \u201d. In 1757 he himself played assistant to one of the goriest executions of the 18th century, on a man who tried to do what Charles-Henri would become infamous for \u2013regicide. Robert-Fran\u00e7ois Damiens was an unemployed ex-servant who seems to have been suffering from some form of mental illness. He blamed Louis XV for Jansenism (a sect of Catholicism) having been ruled heretical, and so when the King was  ...\n On the morning of the 28th March 1757 Robert-Fran\u00e7ois Damiens was taken to a scaffold in the center of Paris. There a massive crowd (which included the infamous Casanova) were witness to him being subjected to literally medieval tortures. The official executioner was Charles-Henri \u2019s uncle, Nicolas-Charles-Gabriel Sanson. Charles-Henri and several others assisted. From the outside it was terrifying, but from the inside it was almost farcical. France \u2019s last regicide had been in 1610, and the  ...\n  Nicolas-Charles-Gabriel retired after the Damiens execution, it apparently being one step too far for him. Charles-Henri, on the other hand, seems to have had the opposite reaction. Far from putting him off his trade, the gruesome event inured him to it. No other job could be so bad after it. That wasn \u2019t to say it was smooth sailing. One notable incident came in 1766 when an old friend of his father \u2019s was the subject of \u201cthe work \u201d. Thomas Arthur, the comte de Lally, was a French nobleman  ...\n Thomas Arthur and Madame Tiquet were both high-born, which is why they rated decapitation as their method of execution. Most other criminals were hanged, though those whose crimes were considered more heinous rated more elaborate forms of death. Heretics were burned, counterfeiters were boiled alive and murderers faced being \u201cbroken on the wheel \u201d. They were lashed to a circular wheel and had their limbs broken with an iron bar before being finished off. As the more compassionate ideals of  ...\n  Leading the charge was Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, a doctor who had been elected as one of the deputies for Paris to the General Assembly in 1789. Guillotin was actually against the death penalty on principal, but thought that the first step would be to make the process as painless as possible. He proposed a motion that all death sentences should be decapitations carried out by mechanical means. The motion was passed. The decapitation machine was originally called a \u201clouisette \u201d, after its designer  ...\n Charles-Henri Sanson was a huge advocate of the guillotine, though his motives may have been slightly selfish. Not only would it make his job a lot easier, but it would also mean that he would no longer need to maintain a vast array of execution tools. He took on the job of testing the prototype, starting with straw bales. These were followed by living sheep and then human corpses. The machine was declared a success and the first official guillotine was created by Tobias Schmidt, a maker  ...\n  At first glance, you might have expected the French Revolution to have been bad news for Charles-Henri. Here was a man who dealt out death on behalf of the upper classes, after all. He was well-paid; enough that his fancy green coats actually set a fashion at court. And he was descended from a noble family. But the Revolution was not the sudden violent upheaval that popular imagination portrays. It began with social reform, and it was middle-class artisans like the Sansons who were at the  ...\n It was no light thing to execute a king. When King Charles of England was executed, his executioner \u2019s identity was a closely held secret. And in validation of that secrecy, after the Restoration every member of Parliament who had voted for his execution was tracked down and themselves executed in far more tortuous fashion. Charles \u2019executioner had been either Irish or Scottish, too. [1] But the principles of the Republic meant that it was important to them that Louis be executed by a  ...\n  The execution took place in January of 1793. It was a gloomy damp morning, and reportedly the King was silent except for some prayers on his two-hour coach ride to the scaffold. Once he arrived there was some confusion, which led to a rumour that the king had tried to fight his way free. This wasn \u2019t true though, and apparently was due to the king \u2019s protests when he found out that his hands were to be bound with a length of rope. His confessor persuaded him (by pointing out that Jesus  ...\n That same blood now bound Charles-Henri Sanson to the Revolution, which had much more need of his services as the frenzy of execution known as \u201cthe Reign of Terror \u201dwent into full swing. In the first half of 1793 the Committee of Public Safety took power, and over the course of the year the number of those sent to the guillotine grew larger and larger. The victims were not just nobles left over from the Revolution, now they included the political opponents of Robespierre and his cronies.  ...\n  The end of Robespierre led to the end of the Terror, as the new government sought to disassociate themselves from the excesses of the previous regime. The death penalty remained, however, and \u201cth work \u201dcontinued. Charles-Henri Sanson retired in 1795, handing over his position to his younger son Henri. Both of Charles-Henri \u2019s sons had followed into his trade but the eldest and original heir, Gabriel, had died in a workplace accident several years earlier. While holding a head up to  ...\n In his retirement Charles-Henri retained a macabre celebrity. One famous story is that he was visited by Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon asked him if the people he had killed as an executioner weighed on his conscience. Charles-Henri joked:\n  Napoleon \u2019s response was not recorded. Charles-Henri continued in his retirement until 1806, when his ill-health caught up with him and he died. Henri continued as the High Executioner of Paris until 1839, when he was replaced by his own son Henri-Clement. Henri-Clement was the last Sanson to be an executioner, and the story of how he lost his job is somewhat sordid. He was always a spendthrift, and deep in debt he wound up either selling or pawning his guillotine, which dated back  ...\n  [1] There were three men who were picked as executioner, and only they knew which one wielded the axe. Famously one went to live in Galway afterwards where he used the money to establish a pub, amusingly titled \u201cThe King\u2019s Head\u201d.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:22", "tags":

"note_en": "NASA on Thursday awarded three companies contracts to build spacecraft capable of landing humans on the moon, sparking a new space race that NASA hopes will propel the United States back to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972.\n Blue Origin, the  space outfit owned by Jeff Bezos; Dynetics, a subsidiary of Leidos, a Reston, Va.-based information technology firm; and  Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX won contracts, giving NASA three options that would compete against each other as NASA scrambles to meet an ambitious White House mandate to put humans on the moon by 2024. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n Boeing, typically among NASA\u2019s key contractors but whose space program has experienced multiple setbacks and delays,  also submitted a bid but was not selected.\n  In an interview with The Washington Post, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said he remains confident NASA will be  able to meet the 2024 deadline, even though the first flight of the Space Launch System, the Boeing-built rocket that would launch astronauts to the moon, will be  pushed back again, this time to November 2021.\n  Still, the announcement of contracts for the landers \u2014 the first lunar spacecraft contracts NASA has awarded since the 1960s\u2019 Apollo era \u2014 is a significant step toward getting the U.S. crews to the moon quickly and building what NASA hopes will become a permanent presence on the moon\u2019s surface.\n A lunar landing is \u201cstarting to feel very, very real,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. There have been lots of attempts to go back to the moon since 1972, but none have materialized.\u201d\n   It\u2019s not clear yet, however, that NASA\u2019s latest effort, dubbed \u201cArtemis\u201d after the twin sister of Apollo, will materialize, either.\n To give itself a better shot at pulling off the feat by 2024, NASA has changed its plans. Initially NASA was going to fly its astronauts to an outpost in orbit around the moon, known as the Gateway. From there, they would descend to the lunar surface. But now NASA says that while it remains committed to the Gateway for the long term, it will likely not use it for the next moon landing.\n  Instead it intends to fly  astronauts in the Orion spacecraft, built by Lockheed Martin, to lunar orbit, where it would meet up and dock with the lander, which would take them to the moon\u2019s surface. Still, NASA officials said, the plan could change.\n  For a moon landing to become a reality, however, NASA and the White House must sell their plan to a skeptical Congress, which has not yet signed off on a program projected to  cost $35 billion through 2024. NASA and Boeing, the prime contractor on the SLS program, also must make significant progress on the rocket. A recent Government Accountability Office report said that despite years of development, the rocket \u201cmay develop leaks when it is filled with fuel. \u201dAnother recent report, by the  ...\n  NASA also is struggling to get to the moon under a drastically expedited timeline. Initially it was planning to land humans on the moon by 2028. But Vice President Pence last year directed the space agency to do it by 2024 \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d\n  Despite the many challenges, the plan is attainable, Douglas Loverro,  NASA\u2019s head of human spaceflight, said in an interview.\n  \u201cThis is a first giant step, but it\u2019s only the first step,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have so much work ahead of us. Now the hard part begins. And it\u2019s going to take the best of NASA and the best of industry to get there.\u201d\n NASA officials declined to comment on Boeing\u2019s absence from the list. The loss for the aerospace behemoth comes as it has struggled not only with the SLS rocket, but with the Starliner spacecraft it is developing to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station in low Earth orbit. A recent test mission without crews onboard went so badly that the  company decided to refly the flight.\n  For Blue Origin, the contract award is a major victory. Founded in 2000 by Bezos, the company has for years been urging the space agency to return to the moon, specifically the south pole, where scientists have discovered water in the form of ice.\n  Blue has been pitching its lander,  called Blue Moon, since 2017, and Bezos has said he would invest heavily in it himself. Last year,  Blue Origin announcedit was teaming up on the project with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper \u2014\u201ca national team for a national priority, \u201dBezos said. \u201cThis is the kind of thing that \u2019s so ambitious that it needs to be done with partners. This is the only way to get back to the moon fast. We \u2019re not going back to the moon to visit. We \u2019re going  ...\n   Bob Smith, Blue Origin\u2019s CEO, said at a news conference that the effort would \u201chumbly stand on the shoulders of Apollo. \u2026 I know I speak for many on our team that going to the moon is the reason why we got into this business, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about that.&#34;\n NASA said that  Blue Origin was furthest alongwith its project and awarded it the largest award, $579 million. Dynetics, which has paired with the Sierra Nevada Corp., would receive $253 million and scored the highest marks, according to NASA \u2019s source selection document. SpaceX, which bid its Starship spacecraft, won $135 million. The contracts are for the first stage of the program and would last through February 2021. After that, NASA could decide whether to proceed with all three  ...\n  The award was the latest in a string of wins for SpaceX, which is poised to fly  NASA\u2019s astronauts to the space station on May 27. NASA had previously awarded SpaceX a contract, worth as much as $7 billion, to resupply the Gateway with cargo.\n   During the news conference Musk said the announcement would ultimately help move humanity into deep space. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got potential for an incredibly exciting future in space, with a base on the moon and ultimately sending people and having a self-sustaining city on Mars,\u201d he said.\n While the Gateway likely won\u2019t be used for the next lunar landing, Bridenstine said the agency is \u201c100 percent committed to the Gateway. That being said, we are also committed to going as fast as possible.\u201d\n Bridenstine said SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket could be used to launch the habitat and power and propulsion elements of an orbiting space station after they are assembled on the ground.\n  Though the astronauts would only be on the surface of the moon for a number of days, as in Apollo, the goal would be to study the region around the moon\u2019s south pole to help NASA set up a permanent presence there. NASA is particularly interested in the ice discovered in the perpetually shadowed craters, and how it could be used to sustain life and even be converted into rocket fuel.\n  \u201cI view this as learning to fly to the moon again and learning the right way so we can do it again and again,\u201d Loverro said. \u201cThis is not a flash in the pan. It is the first step of many steps we\u2019re going to take there.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:18", "tags": "blue,nasa", "title": "SpaceX\uff0cBlue

"note_en": "Yesterday, I learned that we\u2019re closing down Cliqz\u2014the company I worked for since 2017. I\u2019m digesting this heavy news by reflecting on what I learned during this time and the lessons I\u2019d like to carry with me for my career.\n  Cliqz is a tech company from Munich, Germany. Chestnut trees surround our office. Every Thursday there\u2019s a local farmers\u2019 market in front of our building. (Missing this and the grilled chicken smell especially now during Corona lock-down). We\u2019re around seventy people\u2014mostly engineers. Most of them are called Alexander, Alexandra, Alexei, or Alex. Our coffee machine breaks every two months\u2014about the same time as our backend.\n  We set for ourselves the mission to build a better way to search and browse the Internet. We decided against the easy way to piggyback on already existing technology. Which means that we\u2019re building our very own search engine from scratch. For almost seven years, we\u2019ve been relentlessly working on it. Until yesterday.\n    Cliqz lost the fight against Google. There\u2019s no way to sugarcoat this. This gigantic tech monopoly left no room for a small, privacy-centric competitor from Europe to innovate and bring up new ideas. If Cliqz is not taking up the fight \u2014 who else is? If we never even try to change a system or come up with something new, we\u2019re never going to make a change.\n  Cliqz\u2019s mission wasn\u2019t wrong. Our technology wasn\u2019t wrong. We just didn\u2019t have enough support to pull it off.\n This is a wake-up call. Dear politicians, investors, and consumers:  Support companies that support you. Help them to help you.\n We all have choices, as individuals and as corporate entities. I will use mine wisely. My attention will now more than ever go to companies that offer products and services that want to make a positive change, for our democracy, for our planet, for our economy.  I\u2019ll try my best to pick David over Goliath. What will you do?\n   When you work in a creative role like I did at Cliqz as a Brand Manager, you\u2019ll always experience pushbacks on your ideas. A big part of my job was to come up with new\u2014sometimes weirdly good and sometimes plain stupid\u2014ideas to reach people. Some of the back-burner ideas were: Changing the Cliqz name, turning the browser colors to pick for Valentine\u2019s day, advertising on porn websites (okay, that one made it).\n As the nature of a creative job is, there will always be people who don\u2019t like your idea. How to deal with that?\n  First, walk a mile in their shoes. See it from their perspective. Is there something you can learn from this place of empathy? Secondly, focus your attention and energy on the people who are in favor of your idea and take it from there. Usually, excitement creates more excitement. Soon enough, you\u2019ll have many more people joining in and fueling your idea with useful recommendations and feedback.\n   Most people who work for Cliqz are the very best in their field\u2014browsers, search engines, privacy. These are highly intelligent tech experts. I worked in the Marketing department.  Sometimes it felt like we were speaking entirely different languages. Emoji vs. Python.\n  I wasn\u2019t used to a company that is so strongly driven by tech. We innovated because we could. We went the extra mile for our users because it was the right thing to do\u2014even if nobody would ever notice or appreciate it.\n  A cynic might say that Cliqz failed because of our strong passion for technology and a missing drive from business development. If I were presented with the choice, I\u2019d always choose to work with highly intelligent\u2014sometimes a bit stubborn\u2014tech experts. Their motivation comes from a place of honesty and authenticity and is not driven by pure profit and growth.\n    Cliqzers know one thing: How to party. We were incredibly lucky to have a dedicated Talent and Culture team that pulled off the most incredible events and parties for us.\u00a0I will probably not be this lucky in the future but what I learned is:  Take a break. Dance it off. Celebrate your victories more than you wallow your failures. Grab your colleagues and go for walks. Complement and appreciate each other for your achievements.\n  I\u2019m incredibly thankful for this crazy ride and my team that feels like a family to me. I\u2019m thankful for fearless, honest, and vulnerable leadership, especially from the Marketing leader Corina Cristal. I poured so much of myself into Cliqz and I\u2019m not regretting any of it. This is the way I\u2019d like to work in the future:  With passion, empathy, and a challenge that seems way too big.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:04", "tags": "cliqz", "title":

"note_en": "When I started working with Kubernetes and Infrastructure as Code, I quickly found out that I needed a secrets management solution, but when I googled around there didn \u2019t seem to be a solid consensus on a best practice approach that could be universally applied to all situations. So, earlier this year I set a goal for myself to discover what application and infrastructure secret management solutions exist, come up with which one I thought was best and develop a working mastery of it. While pursuing  ...\n  The majority of people don\u2019t have a technical to layman\u2019s-terms understanding of what a Cloud KMS is or does.\n Those same people don\u2019t realize that although in the past there was no safe way to store encrypted secrets in Git, Cryptography has evolved since then, and now safely storing encrypted secrets in Git is possible thanks to Cloud Provider KMS Solutions such as AWS KMS, Azure KeyVault, or GCP KMS.\n Most of Vault \u2019s hype is warranted as for decades there were no good secrets management solutions, and then here comes Vault from the makers of Terraform, with built-in secrets rotation, actively maintained over time, with great docs, support, and a community, and Vault was the only* solution that met my requirements for what the ideal secrets management solution looks like. I say Vault \u2019s overhyped because I often see it recommended as the gold standard cure all that should be applied to all  ...\n  Integrates nicely with any tech stack via REST API or platform independent CLI binaries. (Bonus if it has smooth integrations with Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, and CICD Pipelines)\n Future Proof Large Community or a history of being maintained over time (Don\u2019t want abandonware, unless it\u2019s could be timeless/feature complete abandonware like Unix Utilities)\n Truly secure (I should be able to convince any security head that it\u2019s bulletproof enough to pass a security audit.)\n Support for Granular ACLs + Dev secret creation self-service options Project level isolation: Ops of project A, shouldn\u2019t see project B\u2019s prod secrets.\n Versioned secrets (Can assist with staging and automating, deployments, rollbacks, and supporting technical debt scenarios where secrets and configuration are intertwined in config files and database connection strings.)\n *Note: Mozilla SOPS also met my requirements, but I didn\u2019t realize it at the time because I originally thought there was no safe way to do git encrypted secrets.\n  Many tools involve storing the decryption key in the user\u2019s home directory or keyring, which leads to the encrypted data and the key being on the same machine.\n In that scenario compromised decryption keys are a statistical inevitability (Vulnerabilities multiplied by clones of the repo multiplied by time)\n It\u2019s impossible to revoke a leaked decryption key. If you\u2019re worried a decryption key could have been compromised, but the probability that it was compromised is low, revoking the key isn\u2019t an option, due to git\u2019s distributed history. Even if you could purge the history of the git server and re-encrypt all the secrets with new encryption keys, there would still exist a historic clone of the repo that could be decrypted with the old key.\n If a compromise is suspected the only viable countermeasure is to rotate all the credentials, which is an expensive operation that management usually isn\u2019t willing to back on a hunch.\n Some of the git encryption tools are footgun solutions: Run command to decrypt secret, then forget to encrypt it before pushing it up to the repo.\n Whenever I found a secrets management solution I noticed I could group it into 4 main categories:\n Specific to a single tech stack (Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Salt, Jenkins) (I dismissed these for reasons 2 and 5)\n  Roll your own Secrets Management Service (There were a few potentially viable options, but each introduced it\u2019s own complexity so it made sense to focus on one. Hashicorp\u2019s Vault was the clear winner given its number of features, documentation, big community, and track record for long term support and development.)\n With my analysis complete, I spent a month of spare time working on a Vault Server for storing static secrets to help me gain a working mastery of Vault, I wanted it to be secure, easy to maintain, and easy to use. I did my best to achieve this by enabling TLS, adding Vault Configuration, Roles, Policies, and Kubernetes Infrastructure as Code for a highly available Vault/Consul Cluster to a git repo, using KMS auto unseal, writing good readme documentation, enabling versioned key-value store,  ...\n  Vault still needs a place to store its secrets. (Where does Vault store its Infrastructure as code secrets? HTTPS cert and IAM password for KMS Auto Unseal)\n Vault \u2019s very expensive in more ways than one. (You have to pay for infrastructure and storage. It \u2019s not simple enough that you could set it up from scratch, write a readme, and train a few people on how to use it within an hour, using Infrastructure as Code and a premade readme in a git repo can help, but even then there \u2019s still a lot to learn. Ops will need to spend time maintaining it with backups, upgrades, and monitoring. Devs need to spend time writing custom wrapper scripts to  ...\n Vault makes life harder for people who need to store secrets, so they\u2019ll avoid using it, which hurts its goal of being a central secrets repo. (Devs need to learn several new commands to interface with Vault or rely on slow Vault GUIs. The majority of preexisting tools are designed to interface with files on a file system. So using tools like vimdiff now require extra steps of logging in, fetching the secret, converting it to a file, and removing the file when done.)\n The default implementation has a security vulnerability that \u2019s expensive to secure. (If someone gets root access to a Vault Server, they can get the master decryption key by doing a memory dump. Hosting Vault on Kubernetes or Cloud VMs leads to more opportunities to get root access. In order to fully mitigate the risk of root access, you \u2019d need to provision machines with Intel Software Guard Extensions, and run your Vault Servers on those in SCONE Security Enclaves (containers running  ...\n Given these drawbacks, I decided to dive deeper and research further, that research lead me to  Soluto\u2019s Kamus where I was introduced to 2 cool concepts: GitOps and zero-trust secrets encryption. That got me leaping through a rabbithole of encryption techniques. At the end of the journey I came up with the following mental schema.\n         KMS is a trusted service that encrypts and decrypts data on behalf of clients, it basically allows a user or machine to encrypt and decrypt data using their identity instead of encryption/decryption keys. (A client authenticates against a KMS, which checks their identity against an ACL, if they have decryption rights, the client can send encrypted data in a request to the KMS, which will then decrypt the data on behalf of the client, and send the decrypted data back to the client over  ...\n   KMSs are extremely secure, they make it feasible to go a decade without leaking decryption keys. KMS encryption technique\u2019s invention introduced 3 killer pieces of functionality: When responding to a known breach: Before KMS decryption keys would get leaked: you can \u2019t revoke a decryption key, which means you \u2019d need to rotate several decryption keys, re-encrypt all data with the new keys, and try your best to purge old encrypted data. While doing all of this you \u2019ll need to fight with  ...\n Management of encrypted data shifts from an impossible task involving distributed decryption keys, to a trivial task of managing a centralized ACL. It now becomes possible to easily revoke, edit, and assign granular access to encrypted data; and as a bonus since Cloud KMS, IAM, and SSO Identity Federations integrate  ...\n Crypto Anchoring techniques become possible: Network ACLs can be applied to KMS to make it so data can only be decrypted in your environment.\n KMS decryption rates can be monitored for a baseline, when an anomalous rate occurs, alerts and rate limiting can be triggered.\n  Opportunities for decryption keys to get leaked are near zero because clients don\u2019t interact directly with decryption keys.\n Cloud Providers can afford to hire the best security professionals and implement expensive operational processes that are required to keep the backend systems as secure as possible, so backend key leakage opportunities are also near zero.\n My new understanding of advanced encryption techniques lead me to realize that KMS could be leveraged to prevent decryption keys from being leaked. That plus the ability to revoke decryption rights without needing to make any changes to encrypted files makes truly secure encrypted files in Git a reality. I revisited a few Git based encryption solutions I \u2019d previously dismissed and discovered that Mozilla SOPS satisfied all of my criteria for an ideal secrets management solution. It  ...\n    One of the footguns in other Git based encryption solutions was that someone could accidentally push a decrypted secret to the git repo. With SOPS when you want to edit a file, the file stays encrypted on disk, gets decrypted in RAM where you can edit it with vim, and when you save the edited file it gets re-encrypted before being written to disk. At the same time, it does offer the flexibility to quickly decrypt a few files so you can use a tool like vimdiff.\n  It doesn\u2019t require infrastructure and it\u2019s as cheap as KMS. You could easily set it up, train a few people, and write a readme file within an hour, here\u2019s an example of how easy it is to setup and use:\n        This will open the vim editor so you can type what you want to store in the secret. This simple command is used to both create and edit files.\n     SOPS will use your AWS credentials stored in  ~/.aws to authenticate against KMS so you can encrypt and decrypt without a password. SOPS will also recursively look for .sops.yaml files so it\u2019ll auto discover metadata about how it should encrypt and decrypt things, which has two important ramifications: first, a user doesn\u2019t have to learn a ton of commands or flags. Second, an additional  .sops.yamlfile can be added to a subfolder representing a production environment or different project,  ...\n SOPS encourages workflows patterns that make life easier. Devs can store their secrets encrypted right next to and in sync with the version of the code that uses it. Secrets management suddenly gains all the benefits of git: auditable change management, peer reviews via pull requests, diffs of edits to secrets are meaningful because only edited values will get updated on edits, vs the entire file getting re-encrypted, this also makes merge conflicts less likely. Consistency and  ...\n Hashicorp Vault will have trouble achieving its goal of being a centralized secret repo for your organization because users will find it hard to use, devops will find it troublesome to maintain, and management could find it expensive. SOPS, on the other hand, is pain-free to use, easy to learn, cheap to maintain, and supports workflow patterns that make life easier! These things together mean as long as someone can pitch it to the organization, there will be no barriers to adoption,  ...\n I\u2019d like to clarify that the purpose of this article isn\u2019t to say Vault\u2019s bad and you should use SOPS and KMS instead. I wrote this article for 3 reasons: One, I love to teach. Two, I wanted to point out some shortcomings of Vault. Three, KMS with SOPS is an amazing combo that\u2019s massively underrated: no one seems to know about it, I never encountered a proper explanation of either during my research, and according to  Google Trendsthere are not many searches of SOPS compared to  ...\n I \u2019d like to end this article by saying that I wholeheartedly recommend everyone learn SOPS, KMS, and Vault. Why learn Vault if it \u2019s hard and SOPS with KMS does the same thing with ease? Two reasons really: One, Vault is among the best in class when it comes to PKI and secrets rotation, both of which can be needed to satisfy many government and banking security compliance standards. Two, Vault gets easier to use every year: The community has accepted it as a clear winner and  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:58:58", "tags": "sops,\u673a\u5bc6,vault", "title": "Mozilla sops with

"note_en": "Google Cloud  Data Catalog is a fully managed and scalable metadata management service. It can help your organization quickly discover, understand, and manage all your data from one simple interface. Accessible from within the  Google Cloud console, Data Catalog allows immediate access to data discovery without requiring any upfront setup.\n The Data Catalog service is now generally available, providing regionalized service in 23 different regions globally. In addition to providing higher resilience against potential outages, the regionalized service delivers metadata residency at rest in each of the supported regions while providing a unified view of all data assets distributed across multiple regions.\n Most organizations today are dealing with a large and growing number of data assets, and want to open up access to that data so business users can find the right data assets through self-service. Past approaches have failed to scale up, required tedious set up, and did not deliver easy data discovery for all.\n At Google, we also faced this challenge for large and growing data assets, and built an internal data catalog service to help bring comprehensive metadata management to all data users. You can see more about the techniques used to build an effective data catalog in  Goods: Organizing Google\u2019s Datasets. Data Catalog builds on that foundation, bringing a scalable managed service to all Google Cloud users for data within BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Storage. Here are some details on how Data Catalog  ...\n Auto-syncing technical metadata Technical metadata for all  Google BigQuery data assets like datasets, tables, and views is synced into Data Catalog on a continuous basis. This means you can start using Data Catalog instantly and don\u2019t need to deal with any tedious setup. Data Catalog also auto-syncs technical metadata from  Pub/Sub and user-created filesets from  Cloud Storage. These filesets are simple to create \u2014you just need to specify a pattern with wildcards and apply it to a bucket. A fileset  ...\n  Technical metadata vs. business metadata Technical metadata refers to metadata that is available in the source system. Technical metadata for a BigQuery table includes table name, table description, column names, column types, column descriptions, creation date, last modification date, and more. For Pub/Sub, technical metadata refers to Pub/Sub topic names and date created. For Cloud Storage filesets, technical metadata refers to the fileset name, the pattern used for creating the fileset, creation  ...\n Business metadata refers to the collection of metadata that is critical for business and operational purposes but is not available in technical metadata. Business metadata might include the person responsible for a particular data asset, whether the data asset contains personally identifiable information (PII), if the data is approved for official use, the data retention policy for the data asset, the life cycle stage of the data asset, the data quality score, any known data quality issues, or  ...\n Data discovery Data Catalog can be used from a Google Cloud project by simply enabling it in that project. Data Catalog discovers data assets that are located not only in the project where the API is enabled but across all projects and across all regions. Support for data assets outside of BigQuery, Pub/Sub and Cloud Storage are in the Data Catalog roadmap, while support for non-Google Cloud data sources are available through open-source connectors (see below).\n You can use Data Catalog to search for all your data assets by simply typing a keyword and discovering all matching data assets. You can also narrow down your search to locate data assets in specific projects, systems, types of data assets, or data assets created during specific time periods.\n  Structured tags for business metadata At Google, we believe that simple string tags, once used widely, are no longer sufficient to capture the richness of business metadata. With Data Catalog, you can create tags with structure such that each tag contains multiple attributes, and each attribute is of one of the types  string, double, boolean, enumerated, and  datetime. Creating structured tags is a two-step process. First, define the structure of your tag in a tag template, then create tags with  ...\n As illustrated below, the structured tags on data assets provide rich business metadata to all data users. You as a data analyst or a data scientist can search for specific tags and better understand your data assets with the business context provided by the collection of tags. You as a data curator or a data governor can better manage data assets by using the metadata on data quality and data governance.\n  Access control for metadata Data Catalog is integrated with Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM). All operations, including search for data discovery, are serviced in accordance with the applicable access control specifications. If user A has read access to a data asset and user B does not have any access to that data asset, a search carried out by user A reveals the data asset, while the same search carried out by user B does not return the data asset.\n Metadata can be sensitive in nature and data governance teams might want certain business metadata tags to be visible only to select groups of users. Data Catalog provides access control on templates, and the access control extends to all tags created using that template.\n Auto-tagging PII data with Cloud DLP Data Catalog\u2019s integration with Cloud Data Loss Prevention (Cloud DLP) enables users to run Cloud DLP inspection jobs on BigQuery and  automatically create Data Catalog tags for identifying PII data. You can find this in the Cloud DLP interface. You can also refer to the Google tutorial  Create Data Catalog tags by inspecting BigQuery data with Cloud Data Loss Prevention and use the accompanying  source code.\n  Data Catalog support for non-Google Cloud data assets The Data Catalog API supports ingestion of technical metadata from non-Google Cloud data assets as well. The open-source connectors are organized in four Google Cloud Github repositories:  datacatalog-connectors contains the common components for all connectors;  datacatalog-connectors-rdbms has connectors for Oracle, SQL Server, Teradata, Redshift, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Vertica, and Greenplum;  datacatalog-connectors-bihosts connectors for Looker  ...\n  You can attach structured metadata tags on the Data Catalog entries for data assets that reside outside of Google Cloud. The single interface of Data Catalog lets you discover, annotate, and manage all your data assets.\n Next steps with Data Catalog\u00a0 Data Catalog is now GA and provides self-service data discovery at scale to enterprise users across all regions. Getting started with Data Catalog couldn\u2019t be easier, as it does not require any setup to quickly discover, understand, and manage all your data in Google Cloud and supports ingesting on-premises metadata from non-Google Cloud data sources.

And it needs to be secure. While AWS could have gone with existing technology, to satisfy both these main requirements, they went with building something new, Firecracker, that is both really fast \u2013it can boot Linux and start executing user space processes in 125ms \u2013and secure \u2013it uses hardware virtualization and more to isolate one Lambda environment from the other. In this article, we \u2019ll take a deep dive and look at how  ...\n   While it certainly is fun to read a lot of source code and figuring out what is going on under the hood, it is not as much fun as firing up your favorite editor and whipping up a lightweight virtual machine environment under Linux. With  Sparkler, will build a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that manages a virtual machine while providing a certain environment to the virtual machine, which it runs. We will also write a tiny \u201coperating system \u201dwhich will run inside the virtual machine. The VMM emulates  ...\n If you are interested in understanding how KVM works while getting your hands dirty with example code, I recommend you read this  article on Sparkler.\n  Running unmodified operating systems, especially ones for which source code isn \u2019t available means that the virtual machine has to very closely resemble a real PC. QEMU or Virtual Box do use KVM to speed up guests as much as possible, but they also emulate a real PC with BIOS routines, various legacy and peripheral devices like graphics, sound and storage cards. This is why is is easy to run off-the-shelf versions of MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows or binary Linux distributions like Fedora or Ubuntu  ...\n But, as for these legacy and other devices, KVM directly has very limited support for these. Also, when operating system boot, the boot loader usually depends on BIOS routines to deal with hardware like the screen, keyboard and disks. QEMU uses  SeaBIOS as its choice of BIOS firmware, for example and it ships with it. Without BIOS routines being present, it wouldn\u2019t be a real PC and this will stop it from running off-the-shelf operating systems.\n The most important takeaways are that there is a lot of legacy code like the BIOS and emulation of full-blown peripherals, which is relatively very slow in virtualization systems that are designed to emulate a PC as closely as possible.\n  When a PC starts, the CPU is in real mode or 16-bit mode. The BIOS runs the power-on self-test or POST, reads in the boot loader from the designated boot device to a set location in RAM and passes control over to it. The boot loader usually uses BIOS routines to display text, read disks, get system information etc.\n It turns out that the Linux kernel does not need BIOS routines at all. It is the boot loader that does. Linux has what is know as a \u201cboot protocol\u201d, which tells the boot loader or any other program present at boot time, how to lay out the kernel and supporting data structures in RAM and how to pass control to the kernel. For the x86 architecture,  boot protocols are available for real mode, 32-bit and 64-bit modes.\n So, just like how we loaded the monitor program binary into the allocated guest memory, Firecracker loads the Linux kernel, setting up the required data structures like initial stack, command line parameters, as per the Linux kernel boot protocol. See the following files from the Firecracker Git repo:\n  This does away with the need for having any BIOS routines loaded during the boot process. This simplifies the design of the virtual machine by removing all the complexity required to enable a boot loader or having a need for BIOS routines at all.\n In the tiny Sparkler monitor program, there is no use of any BIOS routines as well. Also, because there is no BIOS at all. The  print_str routine for example, uses the  OUT x86 instruction to output characters, which causes a VM exit. These exits are handled by the  sparkler program, which uses the  putc()library function to display the character on to the terminal. Something very similar happens in Firecracker as well. A virtual serial console is setup for the Linux kernel via memory-mapped  ...\n  The other clever thing about Firecracker is that the virtual machine in which it runs the Linux kernel has very few devices. Linux, on x86 assumes the presence of an interrupt controller and an interval timer. These are really fundamental since the CPU doesn \u2019t have these built in. While it is possible to emulate these devices in the VMM, KVM provides a way better alternative. It is able to emulate them in-kernel for you. This is a big deal. Remember that as long as there is not VM  ...\n   If you look at the source code of the PS/2 keyboard controller emulated by Firecracker, you\u2019ll notice that it is really sparse and it implements only one main function  trigger_ctrl_alt_del(), which is pretty self-explanatory.\n  VirtIO needs a bit more explanation. Real hardware devices have all kinds of quirks and are fairly complicated to program. When you have operating systems that can \u2019t be modified, but come with drivers for some hardware devices, it makes sense to emulate them. That way, it becomes possible to run these operating systems unmodified. But with Linux \u2019s rich history of virtualization, there are more high-performance solutions available. Modern Linux kernels ship with drivers for a virtual  ...\n VirtIO was developed initially by Rusty Russell for  LGuest, which made its way into the kernel in 2007, but was removed in 2017. VirtIO however, continues to thrive. VirtIO now has a  specificationand device drivers are available in-tree in the Linux kernel. The concept behind VirtIO is very simple. It specifies a way for the guest and host to communicate efficiently. It defines various device types like: network, block, console, entropy, memory balloon and SCSI host. It supports  ...\n Since the Linux kernel also ships with device drivers for VirtIO devices, all the host needs to do is to emulate the specially-designed-for-virtualization VirtIO devices and have Linux work seamlessly with them, with much better performance compared to emulating some other real hardware device Linux also supports.\n There is another very powerful feature of the Linux kernel called vhost. These are basically VirtIO devices emulated in the kernel directly, which means that there is no need to context switch to the VMM to deal with I/O from VirtIO devices. At the time of this writing however, Firecracker emulates both the network and the block VirtIO devices in the VMM and does not depend on vhost for further acceleration.\n At the time of this writing, Linux kernel 5.4 hasn\u2019t yet been released, but there is a  patch that implements virtio-fs, which allows efficient sharing of files and directories between hosts and guest. This way, a directory containing the guests\u2019 file system can be on the host, much like how Docker works.\n  For a use case like AWS Lambda, it might not be a such good idea to just run processes (inside which Lambda functions run) belonging to different accounts on the same physical or virtual server. It would be a security nightmare. You can \u2019t blame an architect however, if she chose to run processes from different accounts inside of Linux containers (using something like Docker). The only thing is we don \u2019t really know what holes exist yet, letting processes break their container  ...\n With containers being the main unit of abstraction, one common worry about Kubernetes security is the Linux API\u2019s attack surface. Well, there has been improvement in this direction with projects like  Kata Containers, which run micro-VMs that use hardware virtualization for the containers, while providing a Kubernetes compatible interface so that Kubernetes can be used to orchestrate these containers. Similar to Firecracker, Intel started a project,  NEMU, which is QEMU cleaned  ...\n From the interface perspective, another important point to consider is the minimal set of devices supported by Firecracker. This further reduces the available attack surface.\n  Firecracker goes much further than just resting on security that hardware-based virtualization buys. There are two primary mechanisms used to secure the Firecracker process further. First, it can be deployed via a  jailor utility, which uses  chroot() and  cgroups to restrict the Firecracker process. Furthermore, it also  uses seccomprules to limit what the Firecracker process can do on the host system. Rules are setup carefully to only allow system calls that Firecracker explicitly  ...\n  Firecracker is a VM environment specially built to run only the Linux kernel, doing away with legacy BIOS or devices, while leveraging modern, virtualization techniques like VirtIO and securing the Firecracker process with  chroot(),  cgroupsand seccomp rules. On one side we have the most generic virtualization systems like QEMU and Virtual Box which can run pretty much any OS targeted at PCs, whereas on the other side, we have systems like Firecracker that are specialized  ...\n We also went into great detail of how KVM works by building a virtual machine monitor (VMM) in C. This is the piece that interfaces with KVM to create a hardware based virtual machine in which we ran a small program written in assembly language which talks to the VMM using devices that the VMM emulates. While there is a simple \u201cconsole \u201ddevice that lets the VM input and output text, there are other more complex devices that can read a tweet, get the weather and air quality  ...",

"note_en": "A private equity firm will not gain control of dot-org, the digital real estate that is home to millions of nonprofits, nongovernmental organizations and community groups.\n The board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees the internet naming system, decided on Thursday night to veto the sale of the rights to dot-org to Ethos Capital, which had offered more than $1 billion.\n Maarten Botterman, the chair of ICANN, wrote in  a blog post that after all the considerations were weighed, rejecting Ethos\u2019s proposed bid was \u201creasonable, and the right thing to do.\u201d\n Ever since the planned sale was announced in November, the deal had stirred  fierce opposition. Dot-org is best known as the cyber neighborhood to nonprofit organizations with civic missions like the Red Cross (redcross.org), Human Rights Watch (hrw.org) and NPR (npr.org).\n To many, handing control of dot-org to a private equity firm seemed almost like heresy. The growing ranks of opponents eventually included internet pioneers, nonprofit leaders and the attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra.\n  The opponents raised several concerns, including the risk of steep price increases, underinvestment and censorship. Ethos Capital tried  to address those worries by pledging to set up a \u201cstewardship council\u201d of outside experts and making \u201cpublic interest commitments\u201d to restrain price increases and not censor web content.\n But critics remained unconvinced. They did not believe that a private-equity firm, driven by the need to deliver rich returns for investors, would act in the best interests of what they regard as the domain of online civic society.\n In an interview on Friday, Mr. Botterman said a \u201cconvincing majority\u201d of the 15 voting members of the board opposed the Ethos Capital bid. The overarching concern, he said, was the apparent \u201clack of guarantees that the spirit that was always intended for dot-org\u201d would be preserved if the private equity firm gained control.\n ICANN\u2019s ruling on Thursday and the current arrangements for managing dot-org are byproducts of the arcane governance and history of the internet naming system.\n In 2002, ICANN granted the Public Interest Registry, another nonprofit, the right to run the dot-org domain. Part of the rationale was that the domain should not be managed on a purely commercial basis \u2014 unlike dot-com and dot-net, for example.\n The Public Interest Registry, in turn, is controlled by the Internet Society, a nonprofit that helps develop internet standards, education programs and policy. The registry holds a contract to manage dot-org, which was renewed last year for 10 more years.\n But under the rules governing the registry, ICANN must approve major changes in its practices and ownership.\n The Internet Society saw the sale to Ethos Capital as a way to gain an endowment to fund its operations and get out of the business of operating dot-org, which it wanted to do for some time.\n In an interview this week, Andrew Sullivan, chief executive of the Internet Society, said the Ethos Capital bid was one of several proposals it had received \u2014 and one that appeared to combine people who had internet experience with the financial resources to help dot-org grow and prosper.\n \u201cWe viewed it as a good transaction and that would be good for everyone,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.\n If ICANN rejected the Ethos Capital deal, the Internet Society had no immediate backup plan, Mr. Sullivan said, adding that dot-org would be run as before. \u201cWe will not neglect dot-org,\u201d he said.\n The opposition to the Ethos Capital bid took a number of forms, including  an alterative proposal made in Januaryby a group of internet veterans and nonprofit leaders called the Cooperative Corporation of .ORG Registrants. Among the cooperative \u2019s initial seven directors are Esther Dyson, who was the first chair of ICANN, and Mike Roberts, ICANN \u2019s first president. The Internet Society, Mr. Sullivan said in the interview this week, has not yet had talks with the cooperative \u2019s founders.  ...\n On April 14,  Ms. Dyson and Mr. Roberts wrote to Mr. Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general, urging him to oppose the private equity deal. ICANN is incorporated in California. (The letter was also addressed to the attorney general of Pennsylvania, where the Public Interest Registry is incorporated.)\n In January, Mr. Becerra had expressed concerns about the deal and requested documents. Then, in  a letter to ICANN\u2019s chief executive and board chair on April 15, Mr. Becerra sided with the deal\u2019s opponents and concluded that the dot-org domain and \u201cthe global internet community \u2014 of which innumerable Californians are a part \u2014 are better served if ICANN withholds approval of the proposed sale.\u201d\n The ICANN board came to the same conclusion, after lengthy deliberations and seeing the breadth and intensity of the opposition.\n \u201cThe idea of a private equity firm owning this crucial public asset on the web was just anathema to a lot of people,\u201d said Andrew Allemann, editor of Domain Name Wire, an industry news site.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:58:44", "tags": "equity,\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,internet", "title":

The results of this study do not constitute endorsement by the American College of Sports Medicine. The results are presented clearly, honestly, and without fabrication, falsification, or inappropriate data manipulation.\n   High postprandial plasma lipids (i.e.; triglycerides) (PPL) are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Physical inactivity, characterized by  prolonged sitting and a low step count elevates PPL and thus risk of disease.\n    This study determined if the interruption of  prolonged sitting (i.e.; 8-h of inactivity) with hourly cycling sprints of only 4-s duration each (i.e.; 4-s x 5 per h x 8-h = 160-s per day; SPRINTS) improves PPL. The 4-s sprints employed an  inertial load ergometer and were followed by 45-s of seated rest.\n    Four men and four women participated in two trials. Interventions consisted of an 8-h period of sitting (SIT), or a trial with equal sitting time interrupted with five SPRINTS every hour. The morning after the interventions, PPL and fat oxidation were measured over a 6-h period. Plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations were measured bihourly and incremental area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.\n    No differences (p&gt;0.05) between interventions were found for plasma insulin or glucose AUC. However, SPRINTS displayed a 31% (408\u00b1119 vs. 593\u00b188 mg/dL/6h; p=0.009) decrease in plasma triglyceride incremental AUC and a 43% increase in whole body fat oxidation (P=0.001) when compared to SIT.\n    These data indicate that hourly very short bouts (4 s) of maximal intensity cycle sprints interrupting  prolonged sittingcan significantly lower the next day \u2019s postprandial plasma triglyceride response and increase fat oxidation after a high fat meal in healthy young adults. Given that these improvements were elicited from only 160-s of non-fatiguing exercise per day, it raises the question as to what is the least amount of exercise that can acutely improve fat metabolism

Students working part-time to pay for their studies, parents with two jobs just to stay afloat\u2014not everyone has the luxury of managing their time the way they see fit. But many people do have this flexibility, and yet rush from one task to another without ever taking a step back to ask: am I  really enjoying any of this? Or are these tasks actually making me too busy to enjoy life?\n Research shows that humans tend to do whatever it takes to keep busy, even if the activity feels meaningless to them. Dr Bren\u00e9 Brown from the University of Houston describes being \u201ccrazy busy\u201d as a numbing strategy we use to avoid facing the truth of our lives.\n We are scared of idleness because stopping would mean having to really consider what we want out of life and what we currently have. Sometimes, the gap feels so wide, we\u2019d rather stay on the hamster wheel.\n Being busy is a defense mechanism. It\u2019s a way to avoid just  being. Having responsibilities, deadlines, a long task list\u2026 Overloading our senses can make us believe we are moving in the right direction, or at least in  a direction. But the constant cycle of tasks we tackle without ever thinking often leaves us stagnant. Who proudly looks back at their old to-do lists at the end of the year and thinks: \u201cWow, I tackled so many tasks this year\u201d?\n Instead of measuring progress by the quantity of work we produce, we should consider the quality of our work. Not just the quality of the output, as usually measured by externally-designed metrics, but the quality of the impact it has on our mental and physical well-being. \u201cDid the work feel intellectually stimulating, did I learn something new, did it help me cultivate my  curiosity, did it give me the opportunity to connect with interesting people? \u201dare sensible questions to ask when work represents  ...\n  \u201cYou cannot step into the same river twice, for other waters are continually flowing on,\u201d supposedly said Heraclitus. Time is like a river. If you\u2019re too busy to enjoy life\u2014too busy to spend time with friends and family, too busy to learn how to paint or play the guitar, too busy to go on that hike, too busy to cook something nice for yourself\u2014these moments will be gone, and you will never get that time back.\n You may think it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s not. Like many people, I personally experience  time anxiety\u2014the recurring thought that it\u2019s too late to start or accomplish something new\u2014but the reality is you probably still have many years in front of you. Defining what \u201ctime well spent\u201d means to you and making space for these moments is one of the greatest gifts you can make to your future self.\n Next time you think of  learning something new, or a friend asks you if you want to do something together or have a chat, and your automatic answer is: \u201cI\u2019m just too busy\u201d, take a few minutes to actually consider whether you are actually too busy, and, if that\u2019s the case, whether this busyness is more valuable to you in the long-term than learning something new or spending time with your friend.\n Maybe you are actually going through a temporary phase where you\u2019re working on an exciting but all-consuming project\u2014and that\u2019s fine. Such activities you feel extremely passionate about are actually nurturing. But if \u201cI\u2019m just too busy\u201d is becoming a recurrent answer of yours, you may want to consider whether it is possible to be  that excited over such a long period of time.\n Again, if that\u2019s the case, lucky you\u2014the problem is we usually don\u2019t even take the time to consider the alternative, which is that we\u2019re numbing our minds with work. Being busy with exciting work is good. Being too busy to enjoy life, spending time with the people you love, and exploring your full potential is not. If you belong to the people who do have a choice, consider making the most of your fortunate situation.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:58:34", "tags": "enjoy,\u65f6\u95f4", "title":

13.4", "note_en": "Valve on Thursday  announced that SteamVR no longer supports macOS so that its team &#34;can focus on Windows and Linux.&#34;\n As noted by  UploadVR, Mac users will still be able to use SteamVR by running Windows with virtualization software like Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion. Valve says legacy builds of the virtual reality platform will also remain accessible on the Mac by right-clicking on SteamVR in Steam and selecting Properties &gt; Betas.\n Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi announced that SteamVR was coming to the Mac at WWDC 2017, but a  recent Valve survey indicated that more than 95 percent of Steam users are running Windows or Linux.\n Multiple reports have indicated that Apple plans to release a  combination AR/VR headset by 2021 or 2022, followed by sleeker AR glasses by 2023.\n This is not surprising at all. Apple has not been friendly to developers who want to write cross-platform, enduring code, doing things like deprecating OpenGL and 32-bit support and just in general constantly making it difficult for people to keep old code working. Hell, the rumors of transitioning to ARM suggests this is going to get even worse.  Meanwhile Windows can still run binaries from 20 years ago without much issue. Windows is the gold standard for keeping code working for a long time, second  ...\n Not surprised, only a tiny fraction of Mac machines have the GPU required to use VR.  Also, given the fact that Mac user base is small compared to PCs... it&#39;s not worth while for Valve.  No serious gamer really uses a Mac for games, they use Windows PCs, and Consoles.\n It is only a question or market share, Macs can be great for gaming. OS is super stable, Metal is pretty fast. Toxic comment like yours are another reason.\nToxic? It&#39;s not toxic when it&#39;s a valid criticism. I want gaming on Mac to thrive. Apple has done little on their end to bring this to reality. MacOS may be ready for prime time, but lets be real the hardware side is very lacking to take advantage of that.\n They should have announced they were discontinuing support at the same time they were announcing support for it. Anyone who is involved with gaming at all knew any type of realistic VR solution on Mac was a pipe dream.  Apple is stubborn in their support for the standards needed for gaming. The big game devs aren&#39;t going to rewrite their entire graphics subsystems to Metal and all of the other Apple centric API&#39;s for some piece of a 5% market share (most of that 5% of Steam Mac users are  ...\n Remember, these toxic replies are just opinions, useless, irrelevant opinions. For the Apple haters this is just bias confirmation. We\u2019ve listened for decades to the cacophony of the haters and nothing they predicted has ever come to pass.\nI&#39;m not an Apple hater... Macs have been my daily driver since 2005... But for gaming, and especially VR? It&#39;s a dead end. That&#39;s what PCs are for. Yes, I can play Civ 6 on just about any Mac. That&#39;s great! But almost no Macs support the minimum specs for VR, and the ones that do are very expensive and have either no or very expensive GPU upgrade options, so they have a very short shelf life.\n  Apple last week launched its new 2020 iPhone SE, a low-cost $399 smartphone that features iPhone 8 components upgraded with the same A13 chip available in Apple&#39;s flagship iPhones. We did a full hands-on video back on Friday, but we took the weekend to see how the iPhone SE&#39;s camera measures up to the iPhone 8 and iPhone 11 Pro.\rSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. ...\n Apple has never sold a new iPhone with an OLED display for under $999, but with the iPhone 12 lineup expected to include a wider range of models, that could soon change.\riPhone 12 pricing could start at $649 this year, according to Jon Prosser of the YouTube channel Front Page Tech. Prosser says this information comes from his same source who accurately revealed the new iPhone SE&#39;s launch...\n Many people are wearing masks that cover their faces when going outside, visiting stores, and other tasks, and Apple&#39;s Face ID iPhones do not unlock when the face is obscured by a mask.\rIn the iOS 13.5 beta, released this morning, Apple has streamlined the speed with which the passcode pops up when a person wearing a mask is detected, making it easier to get into an iPhone with a passcode...\n During today&#39;s earnings call covering the second fiscal quarter of 2020, Apple CEO Tim Cook provided some insight on what we can expect from Apple in terms of new products during the global health crisis. A mockup of an iPhone 12 with smaller notch Cook said that Apple is continuing to operate, and that Apple employees are getting used to working from home. &#34;In some areas of the company, some ...\n Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS and iPadOS 13.5 updates to developers, two weeks after seeding the second betas and a month after releasing iOS and iPadOS 13.4 with iCloud Folder Sharing, iPad trackpad support, and more.\riOS and \u200c\u200ciPadOS\u200c\u200c 13.5 can be downloaded from the Apple Developer center or over the air after the proper developer profile has been installed. ...\n VESA today announced that it has released DisplayPort Alt Mode 2.0, paving the way for future USB4 devices to support DisplayPort 2.0.\rAnnounced in June 2019, DisplayPort 2.0 has a max effective bandwidth of 77.4 Gbps, nearly triple that of DisplayPort 1.4. The new standard enables support for displays with up to 16K resolution, higher refresh rates, HDR support at higher resolutions,...\n Intel today officially announced its lineup of 10th-generation &#34;Comet Lake&#34; desktop processors, which includes a number of chips that would be appropriate for the iMac. AnandTech details all 32 of the new processors in organized tables, but only a handful of the chips would make their way into the iMac.\rAt the top of the list is the flagship Core i9-10900K that Intel calls the world&#39;s...\n Google has announced that its Meet videoconferencing service will be free to use for anyone with a Google account from next month. Following a gradual rollout through May, Meet will no longer be exclusive to paying G-Suite members, and will remain open to Google account holders until September 30, 2020. Google Meet offers many of the features that have made Zoom so popular in recent...\n Apple today announced financial results for the second fiscal quarter of 2020, which corresponds to the first calendar quarter of the year.\rFor the quarter, Apple posted revenue of $58.3 billion and net quarterly profit of $11.2 billion, or $2.55 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $58.0 billion and net quarterly profit of $11.6 billion, or $2.46 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter...\n Customers who have purchased the new 2020 iPhone SE have found a surprising missing feature - Haptic Touch does not work with notifications.\rOn the 2020 iPhone SE, long pressing on a notification in the Notification Center or on the Lock screen does not appear to bring up rich notification options to allow iPhone SE users to interact with incoming content.

"note_en": "I realized I was asking Google Assistant the same questions over and over again. Like  What\u2019s the current weather? or  What\u2019s on my calendar for today? So I set out to build a small dashboard for my Raspberry Pi that I could check instead.\n I bought a  Waveshare 2.7inch e-Paper HAT (B) for ~$20. This version comes with a printed circuit board that slots right onto the general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins of a Raspberry Pi. You can also use the included wires to avoid blocking the unused GPIO pins.\n  I followed the installation instructions from the  Waveshare wiki and fired up one of the hello world programs \u2014 there are  versions in C and Python. The steps to get this going, as well as the example programs, are quite accessible compared to other Raspberry Pi hardware accessories.\n  I started picking through the source code of the Python examples to understand how  epd-library works. The version  B of this screen is tri-colored, it can display white, black, and red, and the resolution is 264x176. The examples start by clearing the screen (filling it with white) and then create two layers which are  Image objects from the  Pillow library. One of the layers is the black content and the other layer is the red content. These are then passed to the render function  EPD::display.\n  # initialize the EPD classepd  = epd2in7b .EPD ( )epd .init ( ) # start with a clear (white) backgroundepd .Clear ( ) # define a simple fontfont24  = ImageFont .truetype (os .path .join (picdir ,  &#39;Font.ttc&#39; ) ,  24 ) # create empty image objects/layersHBlackimage  = Image .new ( &#39;1&#39; ,  (epd .height , epd .width ) ,  255 )HRedimage  = Image .new ( &#39;1&#39; ,  (epd .height , epd .width ) ,  255 ) # render the black sectionblack_draw  = ImageDraw .Draw (HBlackImage )black_draw .text ( ( 1 ,  1 ) , top_text , font =FONT_LARGER , fill = 0 ) # calculate  ...\n For the prototype, I\u2019ll show the current weather and some news headlines from the BBC.  Open Weather and  News API both have generous free-tiers. For each of these features, I\u2019ll write functions that return text which I can create layers from.\n I\u2019ll be using  formatted strings from Python 3.5 (as opposed to the superior  f-strings) because that\u2019s what  Raspian (the default Raspberry Pi operating system) comes with.\n  def  get_weather ( ) :  &#39;&#39;&#39; Get the formatted weather description. E.g. `Richmond, GB: Clear sky` &#39;&#39;&#39; owm  = pyowm .OWM (OPEN_WEATHER_KEY ) observation  = owm .weather_at_place (LOCATION ) w  = observation .get_weather ( ) detailed  = w .get_detailed_status ( ) .capitalize ( ) temp_data  = w .get_temperature ( &#39;celsius&#39; ) current_temp  =  str (temp_data [ &#34;temp&#34; ] ) min_temp  =  str (temp_data [ &#34;temp_min&#34; ] ) max_temp  =  str (temp_data [ &#34;temp_max&#34; ] ) text  =  &#39;{}: {}\\n{}\u00b0C ({}\u00b0C  ...\n News API sadly doesn\u2019t have an up-to-date library available so I use  requests to make an HTTP call and parse the data. I can display about three headlines (including an extra wrapped line for each). The text needs to be manually  wrapped to stop it going off-screen.\n def  get_news (limit = 3 ) :  &#39;&#39;&#39; Get some news headlines from the BBC formatted in a list. E.g. `- Acclaimed Swedish author Per Olov Enquist dies - PM&#39;s return to work &#39;a boost for the country&#39; - &#39;Myth that Sweden has not taken serious steps&#39;` &#39;&#39;&#39; url  =  &#39;https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=bbc-news&amp;apiKey={}&#39; . format (NEWS_API_KEY ) resp  = requests .get (url =url ) data  = resp .json ( ) articles  =  [article [ &#39;title&#39; ]  for article  indata  ...\n With these two sections of text, I create the image layers. I want the weather to be on the black-colored layer with a slightly larger font. The news will be underneath on the red-colored layer. Here\u2019s a function that takes an instance of the EPD class as well as two sections of text.\n def  show_text (epd , top_text = &#39;&#39; , bottom_text = &#39;&#39; ) :  &#39;&#39;&#39; Given an EPD instance, and sections of text, render the text. &#39;&#39;&#39; HBlackImage  = Image .new ( &#39;1&#39; ,  (epd2in7b .EPD_HEIGHT , epd2in7b .EPD_WIDTH ) ,  255 ) HRedImage  = Image .new ( &#39;1&#39; ,  (epd2in7b .EPD_HEIGHT , epd2in7b .EPD_WIDTH ) ,  255 )  # render the black section black_draw  = ImageDraw .Draw (HBlackImage ) black_draw .text ( ( 1 ,  1 ) , top_text , font =FONT_LARGER , fill = 0 )  # calculate the depth of the black  ...\n The two Image objects contain simple data and don\u2019t \u2018know\u2019 what color they are. They look like this when rendered to bitmap format.\n  Notice the space that the second layer leaves for the first layer so that the text doesn\u2019t overlap.\n  The main function of this program makes sure that we only display the dashboard during hours when someone will be awake. I want to avoid  ghosting which the documentation warns about. The EPD class that gets passed to the  show_text function is initialized here.\n def  main ( ) :  try : epd  = epd2in7b .EPD ( ) logging .info ( &#34;Init and Clear&#34; ) epd .init ( ) epd .Clear ( ) show_text (epd , top_text =get_weather ( ) , bottom_text =get_news ( ) )  # leave the dashboard up for half an hour time .sleep ( 60 * 30 ) logging .info ( &#34;Clear...&#34; ) epd .init ( ) epd .Clear ( )  except IOError  as e : logging .info (e ) sys .exit ( )  except KeyboardInterrupt : logging .info ( &#34;ctrl + c:&#34; ) epd2in7b .epdconfig .module_exit ( ) sys .exit ( ) while  True : t  = datetime .datetime .now ( )  # rest the screen  ...\n   I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll flesh this prototype out into an open source project so for now the full source code is in a  gist.\n  I didn\u2019t invest any time in working with the four buttons on the left of the screen (they\u2019re labelled KEY1, KEY2, etc. in the above picture) but I think it would be worthwhile to integrate them in a fleshed out dashboard \u2014 they connect as standard GPIO buttons.\n I\u2019ve learned that e-ink screens are worth the investment for me and I might look into getting a much larger version. The viewing angle is like that of a  Kindle and although it\u2019s small it\u2019s beautiful to look at and has a more \u2018real\u2019 feel than a laptop or smartwatch screen.\n I look forward to seeing this technology progress and the commercial applications that arise. I saw that Whole Foods Market were using them in-store back  in 2016. It would be nice to have less LEDs staring at me whenever I leave the house!", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:58:19", "tags": "\u7535\u5b50,ink,epd", "title":

"note_en": "Runa Sandvik works on digital security for journalists, founded upon her experiences working at The New York Times, the Freedom of the Press Foundation and The Tor Project.\n Online child exploitation is a horrific crime that requires an effective response. A  draft bill, first proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) in January, intends to provide exactly that. However, technology experts warn the bill not only fails to meet the challenge, it creates new problems of its own. My job is to enable journalists to do their work securely \u2014to communicate with others, research sensitive stories and publish hard-hitting news. This bill introduces significant harm to journalists  ...\n Under the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (or EARN IT) Act, a government commission would define  best practices for how technology companies should combat this type of material. On the surface, EARN IT proposes an impactful approach. A New York Times  investigationin September found that \u201cmany tech companies failed to adequately police sexual abuse imagery on their platforms. \u201dThe investigation highlighted features, offered by these companies, that provide  ...\n In reality, the criticized features are exactly the same ones that protect our privacy online. They help us read The Washington Post in private and ensure we only see authentic content created by the journalists. They allow us to communicate with each other. They empower us to express ourselves. And they enable us to connect with journalists so the truth can make the page. This raises the question of whether the bill will primarily protect children or primarily undermine free speech online.  ...\n It should be pointed out that EARN IT does not try to ban the use of these features. In fact, the bill does not specifically mention them at all. But if we look at how companies would apply the \u201cbest practices, \u201dit becomes clear that the government is intending to make these features difficult to provide, that the government is looking to discourage companies from offering \u2014and increasing the use of \u2014these features. By accepting EARN IT, we will give up our ability \u2014and our children \u2019s future  ...\n  Four of the \u201cbest practices\u201d relate to requiring companies to have the ability to \u201cidentify\u201d child sexual abuse material. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not possible to identify this material without also having the ability to identify any and all other types of material \u2014 like a journalist communicating with a source, an activist sharing a controversial opinion or a doctor trying to  raise the alarm about the coronavirus. Nothing prevents the government from later expanding the bill to cover other illegal  ...\n Our digital life is protected by the same features that allow some bad people to do bad things online. They protect us as we visit The Washington Post  website, use the  Signal app to contact one of its journalists or use the  Tor Browser to submit information to their  anonymous tip line. These features all enable privacy, a core component of the journalistic process. They enable journalists to pursue and tell the truth, without fear or favor. And not just in the U.S., but globally. We should  ...\n The same New York Times  investigationfound that law enforcement agencies devoted to fighting online child exploitation \u201cwere left understaffed and underfunded, even as they were asked to handle far larger caseloads. \u201dThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), established by Congress in 1984 to reduce child sexual exploitation and prevent child victimization, \u201cwas ill equipped for the expanding demands. \u201dIt \u2019s worth asking, then, why EARN IT does not instead empower  ...\n We must consider the possibility that this bill fails to achieve its stated goal. That it will not protect children online, and will introduce harm to their digital presence and ability to speak freely. Everyone deserves good security, and it \u2019s on us to find ways to prevent harm without compromising on our digital rights. To force companies to weaken our protection to give law enforcement greater insight would be the equivalent of forcing people to live without locks and curtains in their  ...\n That\u2019s not to say we have to accept no solution.
