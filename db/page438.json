"note_en": "Know the architecture just as well as anyone else \u2014 and stay current with the tech stack.\n Schedule 1-1s with your direct reports on a weekly basis. Schedule skip-levels on a monthly basis.\n Be customer-focused. Understand how your products are used in the wild. For example, join sales and support calls.\n Set aggressive but achievable goals. Work backwards by focusing on the outcomes you want to achieve.\n     Ensure every report is aware of the top priorities of the team, organization and company.\n  No task is beneath a manager. Get your hands dirty even if it&#39;s not coding:\n  Never skip one on ones. It&#39;s the best platform for receiving and giving feedback. Most teammates value it and usually when they don&#39;t it&#39;s because they haven&#39;t seen one conducted well.\n   Questions to help frame each topic. &#34;On a scale of 1-10 how would you rate:...&#34;\n Additional questions to ask on a less frequent basis: Organization awareness: What do you see as your top 3 priorities this quarter? The team\u2019s? The org&#39;s?\n  See  getting more from your one on ones for more thoughts on effective one on ones.\n  Default to open questions: ask questions starting with  what,  how,  who instead of closed-ended ones like  do,  have,  is to invite conversation and give ownership over a problem. &#34;Why do you think this is the right approach?&#34; is better than &#34;Is this a good idea?&#34;.\n Summarize what the person is saying so you&#39;re both on the same page and are pinpointing the problem. &#34;It sounds like there are two issues, x and y. Which should we focus on first?&#34;\n  Be specific even if it&#39;s positive feedback. &#34;I like the initiative you took to reduce the service&#39;s memory footprint. It shows ownership.&#34;\n Focus on data and not behavior: &#34;I noticed you didn&#39;t address any of the comments made in your last three PRs&#34;\n Talk about why this matters and who it&#39;s affecting: &#34;I mention it because the ticket I assigned you is critical to this quarter&#39;s roadmap&#34;\n   Highlight positive patterns (remember to be specific). &#34;I like it when you take initiative in cleaning up code because it shows ownership.&#34;\n &#34;It&#39;s great to see you teach X about Y so that they&#39;re as proficient as you. That&#39;s a trait of a senior engineer.&#34;\n  How is your team moving the needle? Are you focusing on the right things? How do you know the features you&#39;re building will benefit the customer?\n  What are the company&#39;s top priorities this year? Where should the company be three years from now?\n   If you were to get promoted, who from your team would take your place? What skills or experience does this person need to acquire?\n  Determine if the decision is  reversible vs. irreversible. Irreversible decisions cannot be changed without significant rework. These decisions should takelonger and be documented and discussed. Examples: architecture changes, language decision, data models.\n Whenever there is disagreement, focus on the intended outcome of the decision and make sure the teamis aware of your reasoning. &#34;While database X is better, I want us to standardize on one stack so that it&#39;s easier to maintain.&#34;\n If someone disagrees with a reversible decision, set a date to revisit that decision with the team.Ideally you also have metrics to define the success of that decision. &#34;I understand your concerns. Let&#39;s revisit this in a month and see where we stand.&#34;\n If someone disagrees with an irreversible decision, give them the opportunity to present their case.Regardless, everyone should be aware the decision is ultimately yours and the team needsto  disagree and commit wholly to the decision made.\n Document your decisions so that you can refer to why they were made and the tradeoffs your team faced.\n   Picking up a p2 bug that&#39;s annoying but never seems to become top priority?  \u2705\n    Avoid  shitty brainstorm sessions. Don\u2019t defer decisions to meetings. Make decisions on the spot, communicate it over long-form writing, and use the meeting to discuss it.\n  Always end a meeting with actions, owners and timing, so it&#39;s clear what next steps are.\n For staff meetings, go around the table and ask reports what their biggest concerns are. Many managers want to attend executive staff meetings, as it makes them feel needed and puts them in the know. I made use of this desire by setting a price of admission to the meeting: you had to fess up to at least one thing that was &#39;on fire.&#39;&#34; - Horowitz\n  The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones. They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability. \u2013 Randall E. Stross\n   Owner. Takes ownership of a problem even when it&#39;s not 100% their responsibility; understands the why. &#34;Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside of your area of responsibility. Why was it important? What was the outcome?&#34;\n &#34;Tell me about a time when you made a hard decision to sacrifice short term gain for a longer term goal.&#34;\n Handles ambiguity &#34;Can you tell me about a time when you had to solve an ambitious problem? Why was the problem important?&#34;\n &#34;Can you tell me about a time when you had to make a decision without complete information? What was the situation? What risks did you take? Why did you make the decision you made?&#34;\n  Communicator. Can articulate ideas at different levels. &#34;You mentioned X in your resume. Explain it to me as if I&#39;ve never come across it?&#34;\n  Deep diver. Digs a level deeper to understand what&#39;s happening under the hood. &#34;Tell me about a time you were trying to understand a problem on your team and you had to go down several layers to figure it out.&#34;\n Simplifier. Simplifies problems instead of just hacks at things and adds tech debt. Does the person have a build vs. buy mentality.\n  Short tenure at companies. If a candidate typically stays at companies for less than a year, ask them why. There might be perfectly valid reasons or it might indicate a pattern that the person is difficult to work with.\n Menu of technologies. Resumes that just list technologies used instead of problems solved may indicate person may not be thinking big picture. Also a typical trait of junior engineers.\n Long resumes. More than 2 pages may indicate the person has difficulty distilling what&#39;s important. That being said, there can be culture reasons for long resumes. For example, in some European countries, resumes are encouraged to be long.\n  Having a good onboarding process is crucial to the success of your team and new team members. It ensures team members are contributing as early as possible and are assimilated into your processes and culture.\n An onboarding process is successful if your new team member can contribute a bug fix on their first day of joining.\n      The Pendulum or the Ladder: On the challenges of being a manager who wants to stay technical.\n  What You Do Is Who You Are: Why company culture matters and how to establish one.\n    LifeLabs Learning. Great workshop for new and experienced managers. I learned a lot from it on feedback, coaching and 1-1s.\n How Software Engineers Can Help Interview Their Future Managers: A list of questions for engineers to ask interviewing managers.\n The Feedback Fallacy: focus on replaying positive performance so team members know how to repeat excellence.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:28", "tags": "\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f,playbook,\u51b3\u7b56,team",

"note_en": "We spoke to Rob Pike, the co-author of the Go programming language, about a career spanning four decades, the evolution of Go over the last ten years, and into the future.\n  Evrone: Unlike many developers today, you started your career decades ago at Bell Labs. What\u2019s been the biggest change in the way we develop software that you can think of, given your rare perspective?\n Rob: The scale is much bigger today. Not just of the computers and the network, but the programs themselves. All of Unix version 6 (circa 1975) fits comfortably on a single RK05 disk pack, which has just over 2MB of storage, with lots of room left over for user software. And that was a fine computing environment, or at least seemed like one at the time. Although I can, of course, explain much of the growth, it is astonishing and perhaps not all of it is justified.\n  Evrone: Given the &#34;resistance to change&#34; and &#34;promise of compatibility&#34; ideas, how do you see the next 10 years for the Go programming language and its ecosystem? What is the best future you envision for your technology?\n Rob: Although it&#39;s far from certain, after over a decade of work it looks like a design for parametric polymorphism, what is colloquially but misleadingly called generics, is coming in the next year or two. It was a very hard problem to find a design that works within the existing language and feels as if it belongs, but Ian Taylor invested a phenomenal amount of energy into the problem and it looks like the answer is now in reach.\n How that affects the libraries, the ecosystem, and the community will be fascinating to watch.\n  Evrone: With &#34;gradual typing&#34; being introduced into &#34;dynamically typed&#34; languages and &#34;type inference&#34; into &#34;statically typed&#34;, the line between two is now blurred. What is your opinion on a type system for a modern programming language?\n Rob: I am a big fan of static typing because of the stability and safety it brings.\n I am a big fan of dynamic typing because of the fun and lightweight feel it brings. (As a side note, the big push for integrated unit testing can be credited to languages like Python, which drove testing to demonstrate correctness that the typing system failed to provide.)\n I am not a fan of type-driven programming, type hierarchies and classes and inheritance. Although many hugely successful projects have been built that way, I feel the approach pushes important decisions too early into the design phase, before experience can influence it. In other words, I prefer composition to inheritance.\n However, I say to those who are comfortable using inheritance to structure their programs: pay no attention and please continue to use what works for you.\n  Evrone: Sometimes people use technologies in strange ways. For example, to generate efficient Go code from the high-level Python or Ruby code (yes, we saw that happening!) Over the years, what is the strangest, most creative or amusing Go usage have you seen? What surprised you the most?\n Rob: The biggest surprise was when we learned that Go was being used to write malware. You can&#39;t control who will use your work or what they will do with it.\n  Evrone: You created a number of text editors. What do you think about the Visual Studio code? With technologies like LSP, the line between &#34;text editor&#34; and IDE is blurred now. Do you think software developers need full-featured IDEs like GoLand or using VSCode is fine?\n Rob: I am from a different time, before IDEs, but there was talk early in the project about whether Go needed an IDE to succeed. No one on the team had the right skill set, though, so we did not try to create one. However, we did create core libraries for parsing and printing Go code, which soon enabled high-quality plugins for all manner of editor and IDE, and that was a serendipitous success.\n More recently, we&#39;ve been working hard on an LSP server for Go called gopls, which can be used by any editor or IDE that supports that protocol to improve the experience working with the language.\n Perhaps because of our comfort working with simpler styles of editor, we made sure that one could work comfortably in Go without heavy lifting from the programming environment. An IDE can certainly help, though: most of those I see working in Go today use one, or at least an editor with custom Go support, and get much value from it.\n The question of what style of editor to use is a matter of taste, colored by the culture of the language you work in.\n  Evrone: Software developers tend to label things, such as Dart being a &#34;frontend language&#34;, and C being a &#34;system low-level language&#34;, and so on. How would you term the Go programming language now, given its feature set and usage?\n Rob: Go is a general-purpose programming language. Write whatever you want in it and don&#39;t worry about pinning the language, or any other technology for that matter, to a single problem domain.\n   Rob: The Go experience has taught me that people love to opine about languages, perhaps more than almost any other element of our field. And I have certainly done so myself. But I am tired of the negativity that often results, so now I try to avoid judging things for others.\n There has been a real renaissance in language design over the last 10 years or so, after a period where very few new languages were arriving and succeeding. It&#39;s great to see this and the innovation it brings.\n  Evrone: How does being a Google employee help you develop and guide the Go language? How important is it to be able to ask &#34;tell us how you use our language&#34; on Twitter and get responses from the biggest companies all over the world? Is it just a nice addition or an essential part of language development? How does Google help you?\n Rob: Google has been very generous in its support for the Go project, for which I am very grateful. And of course the language was created because we thought Google needed it; what became called &#34;cloud computing&#34; needed a language with good support for concurrency and easy deployment, among other things. But Google has not directed the project in any significant way. It supports us and lets us do what we think is best.\n Regarding other companies and other users, input from the community is a vital part of understanding how the project, by which I mean the language, compiler, tools, runtime, library, environment \u2014 all of it \u2014 advances.\n  Evrone: After 10 years of Go development and observing how it is used, what can you name the biggest design success and, opposite, biggest design failure for the language? It&#39;s strongest and weakest points, respectively?\n  The technical one is first-class support for concurrent computation. Go is only a decade or so old, but when it was being developed, &#34;threading&#34; and concurrency were not widely appreciated in the programming community. In fact a major reason for creating Go was the difficulty of doing concurrent computation in C++ at the time. It became clear shortly after launch that the concurrency support was a major attraction, one that compensated for what some felt were  ...\n As John Graham-Cumming of Cloudflare says, &#34; I came for the easy concurrency, I stayed for the easy composition&#34;.\n  The political success was the firm  promisemade about compatibility for Go version 1. Once we, and the community, had used Go for a few years, we had a long list of things we wanted to fix, but change is disruptive. So we did a careful program of updates, with the &#34;go fix&#34; command to pull the community along, and once that was done, not only did we stop, we promised to stay stopped. That stability \u2014Go programs written in 2012 will still compile and run perfectly  ...\n  Evrone: What does your work-life balance look like? There are lots of talks about &#34;burn-outs&#34; right now, and the epidemic situation does not help at all. Any hints from your 40-year journey for new generations of developers?\n Rob: The best way to avoid burnout is to do something you truly enjoy in an environment that supports you. I&#39;ve been very lucky in that regard through my whole career, but I realize not everyone is as fortunate. If you&#39;re feeling stressed by work, you should feel free to take a break or change direction, especially in our current situation.\n  Evrone: In hindsight, the popularity of many technologies is credited to so-called &#34;killer apps&#34; that made them popular. Can you name such a &#34;killer app(s)&#34; for the Go programming language and what do you think about such a &#34;killer app&#34; idea as a whole?\n Rob: A few years ago, Danny Berkholz called Go &#34; the emerging language of cloud infrastructure,&#34; and that is no accident. Go was designed by people working at Google to make it easier to write Google-relevant software, in particular network-resident servers. That&#39;s what we call &#34;cloud&#34; today. (Some of the motivation for the design is in my Splash keynote from 2012,  Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering.)\n So although it was gratifying and important to see Docker, Kubernetes, and many other components of  cloud computing written in Go, it&#39;s perhaps not too surprising. Go has indeed become the language of cloud infrastructure.\n  Evrone: What competition do you see for the Go programming language right now and in what area? What is your opinion about Rust with its &#34;no-garbage-collection&#34; ideas and compile-time guarantees?\n Rob: Rust is an intriguing language and I watch its development with interest. Beyond that, I offer no opinion, as I said above.\n  Evrone: Go has just reached 70k stars on GitHub! How do you see different social activities like GitHub, Reddit, Twitter, offline and online conferences, webinars etc influence the language? Are they important for the language&#39;s success or they just reflect it?\n Rob: The people we have met through conferences and social media have been a critical part of the development of Go and all its elements. Many, many contributors have affected the development in positive ways, including the original port to Windows and a number of non-x86 architectures, development of tools and libraries, thoughtful discussions of technical proposals, and much more.\n And it goes the other way, as the Go team reaches out to the community to start discussions, pose questions, and ask for help and guidance.\n One thing that I think is important is to engage with the community as one voice, to speak as a team rather than as individuals. A consistent message is more easily understood.\n  Evrone: How being the author of one of the popular programming languages has changed your life?\n Rob: A correction: I am a co-author, not the author. Ken Thompson and Robert Griesemer started the project with me, and many others contributed massively. So please don&#39;t single me out as &#34;the author&#34;.\n To answer your question, Go has certainly raised my public profile and introduced me to a new and vibrant community but beyond that it hasn&#39;t had much effect. I&#39;ve had a long career with other successes (and innumerable failures).\n  Evrone: Imagine that you have an opportunity to travel back in time and give only one piece of advice to your younger self, at around the time you\u2019ve started to design the Go language spec. What advice would you give to yourself and your colleagues?\n Rob: That&#39;s easy: Ignore the haters. Just listen to the voices that understand and share your goals; they&#39;re the ones to care about. Not everyone agrees with what you&#39;re doing, and that&#39;s OK. But those who engage in advancing what you&#39;re trying to do can be a fantastic source of ideas, energy, and inspiration.\n   At Evrone we pride ourselves on using the best tool for the job, whether that\u2019s  Ruby on Rails,  Python,  Elixir, or, of course,  Go. We strive to stay at the forefront of a range of technologies to be able to provide the best and most appropriate solutions to meet our clients\u2019 needs, and we\u2019re very happy to do all we can to help bring developer communities together.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:21", "tags": "\u7f57\u4f2f,pike,language", "title": "\u7f57\u4f2f\u00b7\u6d3e\u514b\u91c7\u8bbf", "title_en": "Rob Pike

"note_en": "Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve started to see computers take to the street, and lucky for us, it\u2019s been mostly to help us get deliveries or transport us around. These robots are a combination of sensors, compute units, and some form of connectivity. They have personalities, and if you look closely, two cute eyes on  Postmates\u2019 Servethat provide it with stereo vision to navigate the streets. While \u2018Serve \u2019is fully equipped to navigate the streets, even the smartest robots need help from a  ...\n Many of us have taken accessing computers remotely for granted, despite the fact that our production servers are running behind NAT. This has been made possible by SREs who set up public endpoints and bastion hosts, and configure identity-based authentication as we\u2019ve covered in a previous post called   How to SSH properly. But what if your computer is on the move? What happens if you have thousands of them in thousands of cities? How do you provide access for system-level debugging? Which technical  ...\n   We are lucky to have a range of connectivity options available to IoT devices, from high speed LTE connections to new  LoRaWANnetworks. Once connected to a network, the next step is to get access to the device. This post will focus on using SSH by following best practices. Earlier, we \u2019ve outlined how to configure the local ssh-agent to connect to a Bastion Host. This method works well, but unless you start off with a very good naming convention, it becomes much harder to find that one robot  ...\n We \u2019ve taken the best practices of accessing systems and rolled them into our open source project, Teleport. Teleport was designed as a drop-in replacement for OpenSSH, but with a focus on fleets of servers (clusters) where individual nodes such as self-driving trucks (or regular AWS instances) can be located anywhere in the world. The certificate authority and the audit log are deployed in secure networks with only the proxy available to the public internet. Let \u2019s dive a bit deeper into it.  ...\n  While the technical details of delivery robots are often kept under wraps, we know other people have gone to great lengths to be able to  SSH into lamp posts with David\u2019s Awesome  Shadowing Project. The same approach could be applied to self-driving robots using a reverse SSH tunnel, but this method only scales so far, and it requires more than 50 steps to set up.\n A reverse SSH tunnel is an SSH connection initiated by the host (self-driving vehicle) to the proxy. This connection is maintained for as long as the host is online, and if an engineer or an Ansible script wants to connect to the vehicle, they connect to the proxy, which in turn proxies the connection through the tunnel to the host who initiated it.\n We had many  long standing requests to support reverse tunnels, and with OSS Teleport 4.0, we\u2019ve made setting up and managing these reverse tunnels simpler. This can be set up on the node in a couple of quick steps.\n On the robot/lamp post/self-driving truck, the Teleport daemon will be installed and will then dial back to a central Teleport Cluster.\n  Extra configuration options can be set up to add labels and extra supporting metadata to help the operator.\n After connecting to the proxy, the \u2018node\u2019 - in our case a single Raspberry Pi - will show in the Teleport web UI and you can see it by using the CLI client as well:\n \u279c ~ tsh lsNode Name Address Labels--------------------- --------------- --------------------------------------------------Truck-1821 \u27f5 Tunnel arch=Linux, hostname=postmate-serve-342145 uptime=up 0 minutes, \ud83d\udccd=SF \ud83d\udcf6=5G\n I\u2019m now able to SSH into the node using it\u2019s node name.\n   You can ssh into truck-1821 using it\u2019s nodename, meaning you no longer have to worry about IP addresses or having to setup Dynamic DNS at its location.\n Labels can provide both system and location data. This makes managing a large fleet of devices much easier.\n  Moving up in scale, we\u2019ve started to see more computers move to the edge, and some have speculated that this could be the  end of cloud computing. For context, a self driving truck generates 10 gigabytes of data per mile. Some self-driving companies have published how they manage and set up network infrastructure. Cruise has a  great blog for anyone interested in the topic.\n As these systems become more complex, having more compute and extra redundancy running a container-orchestration system makes sense to scale the workloads associated with many gigabytes of data every mile. Yet for operators, these systems can be increasingly difficult to update, debug, and access. Providing access opens Pandora \u2019s box of issues. If robots or humans can access machines, there needs to be an audit trail, approval workflows, and full visibility into what \u2019s been run  ...\n These problems can be easy to solve on a small scale, but become increasingly difficult with 100+ Clusters. Combining a large cluster with hundreds of employees can create extra operational complexity. We have had many users facing the same problem and by using external identity providers combined with a flexible Role Based Access Control (RBAC), They get access quickly and securely.\n In this quick example we\u2019ll show how a fictional company has deployed multiple kubernetes clusters into trucks, yet still require a centralized command and control over the cluster.\n  Teleport provides users two options for connecting to a Kubernetes cluster, it can be run as a proxy outside the cluster or deployed inside a cluster. We recommend deploying inside a cluster, then registering the cluster back to a central root cluster using t rusted clusters.\n All of these features are available in the OSS version of Teleport, using Github as an SSO provider. We\u2019ve more information on our  Kubernetes integration here.\n   No matter where you run a computer, be it a small home lab, a small robot or many thousands of self-driving trucks, these patterns can be used to get secure access quickly. The use of reverse tunnels to access infrastructure can be very powerful when you don\u2019t have full control over the network.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:19", "tags":

"note_en": "Plants are intelligent beings with profound wisdom to impart \u2014if only we know how to listen. And Monica Gagliano knows how to listen. The evolutionary ecologist has done groundbreaking experiments suggesting plants have the capacity to learn, remember, and make choices. That \u2019s not all. Gagliano, a senior research fellow at the University of Sydney in Australia, talks to plants. And they talk back. Plants summon her with instructions on how to live and work. Some of Gagliano \u2019s conversations happened  ...\n Along with forest scientists like  Suzanne Simard and  Peter Wohlleben, Gagliano raises profound scientific and philosophical questions about the nature of intelligence and the possibility of \u201cvegetal consciousness. \u201dBut what \u2019s unusual about Gagliano is her willingness to talk about her experiences with shamans and traditional healers, along with her use of psychedelics. For someone who \u2019d already received fierce pushback from other scientists, it was hardly a safe career move to reveal her personal  ...\n Gagliano considers her explorations in non-Western ways of seeing the world to be part of her scientific work. \u201cThose are important doors that you need to open and you either walk through or you don \u2019t, \u201dshe told me. \u201cI simply decided to walk through. \u201dSometimes, she said, certain plants have given her precise directions on how to conduct her experiments, even telling her which plant to study. But it hasn \u2019t been easy. \u201cLike Alice, [I] found myself tumbling down a rather strange rabbit hole,  ...\n Shortly before the COVID-19 lockdown, I talked with Gagliano at Dartmouth College, where she was a visiting scholar. We spoke about her experiments, the new field of plant intelligence, and her own experiences of talking with plants.\n   You are best known for an experiment with  Mimosa pudica, commonly known as the \u201csensitive plant,\u201d which instantly closes its leaves when it\u2019s touched. Can you describe your experiment?\n I built a little contraption that allowed me to drop the plants from a height of maybe 15 centimeters. So it\u2019s not too high. When they fall, they land in a softly padded base. This plant closes its leaves when disturbed, especially if the disturbance is a potential predator. When the leaves are closed, big, spiny, pointy things stick out, so they might deter a predator. In fact, they not only close the leaf, but literally droop, like, \u201cLook, I\u2019m dead. No juice for you here.\u201d\n  Exactly. It makes no sense for a plant or animal to repeat a behavior that is actually useless, so we learn pretty quick that whatever is useless, you don\u2019t do anymore. You\u2019re wasting a lot of energy trying to do something that doesn\u2019t actually help. So, can the plant\u2014in this case,  Mimosa\u2014learn not to close the leaves when the potential predator is not real and there are no bad consequences afterward?\n  The test is for a specific type of learning that is called habituation. I decided they would be dropped continuously for 60 times. Then there was a big pause to let them rest and I did it again. But the plants were already re-opening their leaves after the first three to six drops. So within a few minutes, they knew exactly what was going on \u2014like, \u201cOh my god, this is really annoying but it doesn \u2019t mean anything, so I \u2019m just not going to bother closing. Because when my leaves are open,  ...\n  You say these plants \u201cunderstand\u201d and \u201clearn\u201d that there\u2019s no longer a threat. And you\u2019re suggesting they \u201cremember.\u201d You\u2019re not using these words metaphorically. You mean this literally?\n Yes, that \u2019s what they \u2019re doing. This is definitely memory. It \u2019s the same kind of experiment we do with a bee or a mouse. So using the words \u201cmemory \u201dand \u201clearning \u201dfeels totally appropriate. I know that some of my colleagues accuse me of anthropomorphizing, but there is nothing anthropomorphic about this. These are terms that refer to certain processes. Memory and learning are not two separate processes. You can \u2019t learn unless you remember. So if a plant is ticking all the boxes and  ...\n Do you think these plants are actually making decisions about whether or not to close their leaves?\n This experiment with  Mimosawasn \u2019t designed to test that specific question. But later, I did experiments with other plants, with peas in particular, and yes, there is no doubt the plants make choices in real decision-making. This was tested in the context of a maze, where the test is actually to make a choice between left and right. The choice is based on what you might gain if you choose one side or the other. I did one study with peas that showed the plants can choose the right arm  ...\n  Oh, yeah, of course. And I\u2019m not talking about electrical signals. We have also discovered that plants emit their own sounds. The acoustic signal comes out of the plant.\n  We call them clicks, but this is where language might fail because we are trying to describe something we \u2019re not familiar enough with to create the language that really describes the picture. We worked out that, yes, plants not only produce their own sound, which is amazing, but they are listening to sounds. We are surrounded by sound, so there are studies, like my own study, of plants moving toward certain frequencies and then responding to sounds of potential predators chewing on  ...\n  You are describing a surprising level of sophistication in these plants. Do you have a working definition of \u201cintelligence?\u201d\n That\u2019s one of those touchy subjects. I use the Latin etymology of the word and \u201c intelligere\u201d literally means something like \u201cchoosing between.\u201d So intelligence really underscores decision-making, learning, memory, choice. As you can imagine, all those words are also loaded. They belong in the cognitive realm. That\u2019s why I define all of this work as \u201ccognitive ecology.\u201d\n Do you see parallels between this kind of intelligence in plants and the collective intelligence that we associate with social insects in ant colonies or beehives?\n That kind of intelligence might be referred to as \u201cdistributed intelligence\u201d or \u201ccollective intelligence.\u201d We are testing those questions right now. Plants don\u2019t have neurons. They don\u2019t have a brain, which is often what we assume is the base for all of these behaviors. But like slime molds and other basal animals that don\u2019t have neural systems, they seem to be doing the same things. So the short answer is yes.\n What you\u2019re saying is very controversial among scientists. The common criticism of your views is that an organism needs a brain or at least a nervous system to be able to learn or remember. Are you saying neurons are not required for intelligence?\n Science is full of assumptions and presuppositions that we don \u2019t question. But who said the brain and the neurons are essential for any form of intelligence or learning or cognition? Who decided that? And when I say neurons and brains are not required, it \u2019s not to say they \u2019re not important. For those organisms like ourselves and many animals who do have neurons and brains, it \u2019s amazing. But if we look at the base of the animal kingdom, sponges don \u2019t have neurons. They look  ...\n   You know, they just say plants do not learn and do not remember. Then you do this study and stumble on something that actually shows you otherwise. It \u2019s the job of science to be humble enough to realize that we actually make mistakes in our thinking, but we can correct that. Science grows by correcting and modifying and adjusting what we once thought was the fact. I went and asked, can plants do Pavlovian learning? This is a higher kind of learning, which Pavlov did with his  ...\n There\u2019s an emerging field of what\u2019s called \u201cvegetal consciousness.\u201d Do you think plants have minds?\n What is the mind?  [Laughs] You see, language is very inadequate at the moment in describing this field. I could ask you the same question in referring to humans. Do you think humans have a mind? And I could answer again, what is the mind? Of course, I have written a paper with the title \u201cThe Mind of Plants\u201d and there is a book coming called  The Mind of Plants. In this context, language is used to capture aspects of how plants can change their mind, and also whether they have  ...\n Let me ask the question a different way. Do you think plants have emotional lives? Can they feel pain or joy?\n It\u2019s the same question. Where do feelings arise from, and what are feelings? These are yes or no questions, usually. But to me, they are yes  and no. It depends on what you mean by \u201cfeeling\u201d and \u201cjoy.\u201d It also depends on where you are expecting the plant to feel those things, if they do, and how you recognize them in a human way. I mean, plants might have more joy than we do. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t know because we\u2019re not plants.\n We have only talked about this from the scientific perspective, which is the Western view of the world. But I \u2019ve also had a close relationship with plants from a very different perspective, the indigenous world view. Why is that less valuable? And when you actually do explore those perspectives, they require your experience. You can \u2019t just understand them by thinking about them. My own personal experience tells me that plants definitely feel many things. I don \u2019t know  ...\n  You\u2019ve studied with shamans in indigenous cultures and you\u2019ve taken ayahuasca and other psychoactive plants. Why did you seek out those experiences?\n I didn \u2019t. They sought me. So I just followed. They just arrived in my life. You know, those are important doors that you need to open and you either walk through or you don \u2019t. I simply decided to walk through. I had this weird series of three dreams while I was in Australia doing my normal life. By the time the third dream came, it was very clear that the people that I was dreaming of were real people. They were waiting somewhere in this reality, in this world. And  ...\n  The first time I went, I found this place that was in my dream. It was just exactly the same as what I saw in my dream. It was the same man I saw in my dream, grinning in the same way as he was in my dream. So I just worked with him, trying to learn as much as I could about myself with his support.\n This was a local shaman whom you identify as Don M. And there was a particular plant substance, a hallucinogen, that you took.\n I did what they call a \u201cdieta, \u201dwhich is basically a quiet, intense time in isolation that you do on your own in a little hut. You are just relating with the plant that the elder is deciding on. So for me, the plant that I worked with wasn \u2019t by itself a psychedelic in the normal way of thinking about it. But of course, all plants are psychedelic. Even your food is psychedelic because it changes your brain chemistry and your neurobiology all the time you eat. Sugars,  ...\n  When you \u2019re trying to describe this to people haven \u2019t had the experience, it probably doesn \u2019t make much sense because this kind of knowledge requires your participation. I don \u2019t hear someone talking to me as if from the outside, talking to me in words and sound. But even that is not correct because inside my head it does sound exactly like a conversation. Not only that, but I know it \u2019s not me. There is no way that I would know about some of the information that  ...\n Early this summer I met a friend for breakfast at a restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. While waiting for him to arrive I spent some time staring at a lot next door\u2014a vacant lot, as the spaces are called, but also...  READ MORE\n Are you saying these plants had specific information to tell you about your life and your work?\n Yeah, I mean, some of the plants tell me exactly how wrong I was in thinking about my experiments and how I should be doing them to get them to work. And I \u2019m like, \u201cReally? \u201dI \u2019m scribbling down without really understanding. Then I go in the lab and try what they say. And even then, there is a part of me that doesn \u2019t really believe it. For one experiment, the one on the Pavlovian pea, I was trying to address that question the year before with a different plant.  ...\n Do you think you are really encountering the consciousness of that plant? Maybe your imagination has opened up to see the world in new ways, but it\u2019s all just a projection of your own mind. How do you know you are actually encountering another intelligence?\n If you had this experience of connecting with plants the way I have described \u2014and there are plenty of people who have \u2014the experience is so clear that you know that it \u2019s not you; it \u2019s someone else talking. If you haven \u2019t had that experience, then I can totally see it \u2019s like, \u201cNo way, it must be your mind that makes it up. \u201dBut all I can say is that I have had exchanges with plants who have shared things about topics and asked me to do things that I have  ...\n  I\u2019m not a medical scientist, but I\u2019ve been given information by plants about their medical properties. And these are very specific bits of information. I wrote them in my diary. I would later check and I did find them in the medical literature: \u201cThis plant is for this and we know this.\u201d I just didn\u2019t know. So maybe I\u2019m tapping into the collective consciousness.\n What do you do with these kinds of personal experiences? You are a scientist who\u2019s been trained to observe and study and measure the physical world. But this is an entirely different kind of reality. Can you reconcile these two different realities?\n I think there are some presuppositions that a scientist should just explore the consensus reality that most of us experience in more or less the same way. But I don \u2019t really have a conflict because I find this is just part of experimenting and exploring. If anything, I found that it has enriched and expanded the science I do. This is a work in progress, obviously, but I think I \u2019m getting better at it. And in the writing of my book, which for a scientist  ...\n  Steve Paulson is the executive producer of Wisconsin Public Radio\u2019s nationally syndicated show \u201cTo the Best of Our Knowledge.\u201d He\u2019s the author of Atoms and Eden: Conversations on Religion and Science.

The decision came in response to two patents \u2014 one for a food container and the other for a flashing light \u2014 that were created by an AI system called DABUS.\n Among  the USPTO\u2019s arguments is the fact that US patent law repeatedly refers to inventors using humanlike terms such as \u201cwhoever\u201d and pronouns like \u201chimself\u201d and \u201cherself.\u201d The group behind the applications had argued that the law\u2019s references to an inventor as an \u201cindividual\u201d could be applied to a machine, but the USPTO said this interpretation was too broad. \u201cUnder current law, only natural persons may be named as an inventor in a patent application,\u201d the agency concluded.\n \u201cUnder current law, only natural persons may be named as an inventor in a patent application.\u201d\n The patents were submitted last year by the  Artificial Inventor Project. Along with the patents submitted to the USPTO, the team also submitted documents to the UK\u2019s Intellectual Property Office (IPO) and the European Patent Office (EPO). The  IPO and  EPO have already ruled that DABUS, which was created by AI researcher Stephen Thaler, cannot be listed as an inventor based on similar legal interpretations. The  USPTO asked the public for opinions on the topic last November.\n The Artificial Inventor Project is not arguing that an AI should own a patent, just that it should be listed as an inventor,   MIT Technology Review notes. It argues that this might be necessary when hundreds or even thousands of employees have contributed code to a system, like IBM \u2019s Watson supercomputer, before the computer itself then goes on to solve a problem. If no human was involved closely enough with an invention to claim credit for it, then the group fears it may be impossible to patent  ...\n The project also argues that allowing AI to be listed as an inventor would incentive innovation since the value these machines are adding would be more clearly recognized. \u201cIf you make a point of recognizing how valuable a machine has been in the creative process, that machine will inevitably become more valuable,\u201d the Artificial Inventor Project\u2019s Ryan Abbott  told the  Financial Times last year.\n Unless the law changes in the future, however, artificial intelligence is likely to continue to be seen as an inventing tool, rather than an inventor.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:00:09", "tags":

"note_en": "Git branches are a powerful tool to organize ongoing work as part of a team and ensure that software delivery stays effective. If you use git today, there are high chances that you&#39;re either using the famed git-flow or the more recent GitHub flow. Both these workflows depend extensively on using branches effectively \u2014 and naming a new branch is something many developers struggle with.\n There are so many conventions and formats that are recommended, but at times following these conventions becomes painful in itself. Herein we outline a simple git branch naming convention that\u2019s easy to follow, and takes care of most common use-cases.\n   Most conventions recommend leading the branch name with prefixes like  hotfix-,  feature-,  chore-, or some other variant of the categorization of tasks. Practically, if you are using an issue tracker, you \u2019re tagging the category of the task in the issue tracker anyway \u2014in addition to much more additional context. Using these categorical prefixes, this, seems redundant at least and requires additional decision-making when naming branches at worst. Leading with the issue tracker ID is convenient,  ...\n The issues created in the issue tracker, in most cases, are used for tracking the team\u2019s progress. It becomes easy to correlate the relevant working branch with each task \u2014 especially when each developer is working on many issues at the same time.\n Searching and filtering is much easier in the issue tracker. Once you know your issue number, it becomes easy to find the branch using auto complete in the local git tree.\n \u279c super-secret-project git: (master ) git checkout 72&lt;TAB&gt;722-add-billing-module -- Apply suggestions from code review720-submodules-rc 722-add-billing-module 723-fix-highlighting 728-fix-homepage-css\n  While using the issue tracker ID itself is sufficient to identify a unique branch in a project in most cases, there could be chances that some more nuance is needed. For example, there could be multiple branches needed to work on one issue, possibly by different people.\n Use a short, actionable descriptor of the task after the issue ID. This makes the branch name recognizable, distinct, and easy to search for in case you don\u2019t have the issue ID handy. Make sure that the descriptor is concise, but descriptive enough to give you an idea of what\u2019s going on in the branch.\n  This is a little opinionated, but hyphens make for good separators in branch names. You could use an underscore,  _, too. The key is to be consistent, though.\n  And that\u2019s it \u2014 just these three rules to keep in mind. No complex naming schemes or rules to follow make it easy for everyone in the team to stay on the same page. Naming things can be difficult at times, and it\u2019s helpful to have simple heuristics. In a world where almost everyone is using some sort of issue tracking anyway, this approach makes git branch naming as easy as possible.\n DeepSource helps you automatically find and fix issues in your code during code reviews, such as bug risks, anti-patterns, performance issues, and security flaws.

"note_en": "The move to innovate at speed and scale is stressing software quality and exposing the limitations of testing.\n  Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 testing in all its forms is inseparable from the software delivery supply chain. Tests and static analysis are essential to software development pipelines, and this holds true for both traditional and cloud-native applications.\n  We are in the midst of  unprecedented times, and in an era of disruption where long-established financial institutions are facing competition from 7 year old startups. Companies are under pressure to move fast to remain viable, even those that have been around for over 100 years, and they need to move twice as fast to defend their position and remain competitive.\n Over a decade ago, when Test-Driven Development (TDD) was introduced, it promised to improve productivity and quality. Even for teams that don\u2019t follow it religiously, but treat it more as a north star. Since then, release cycles shortened, CI/CD is no longer a buzzword, and new companies that develop pipeline automation products \u2013  I\u2019m looking at you GitLab \u2013 are mature enough to IPO.\n To reiterate this point, testing is perhaps more relevant than ever, but when moving fast is table stakes, relying on traditional tests alone for preventing errors is no longer enough. Even though tests are irreplaceable, critical errors still reach production, while customers are waiting on the seamless experience they were promised (right before their  application breaks).\n The bottom line?   Testing is no longer enough. And in this post, we\u2019ll outline how we got here and what the experts have to say on that.\n  In the context of digital business, standing still is the equivalent of losing. Lewis Carroll said it best in \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d which became the basis for what\u2019s called the  \u201cRed Queen Hypothesis:\n  Apart from being a nice anecdote from a great book, the Red Queen Hypothesis originates from an evolutionary concept, proposing that organisms must constantly adapt in order to survive, while pitted against other organisms in a constantly changing environment.\n The same idea can be applied to a business setting, demonstrating why every company is rushing to automate their CI/CD workflows. The second-order effect here is how it applies to testing. When you\u2019re releasing code faster and faster, increasing your development velocity, how can you prevent errors from being promoted? And how can you fix them fast if they do occur?\n The safety measures for a road car going 70mph are very different from those of a F1 car going over 200mph, so as you automate your CI/CD workflows, testing needs to evolve as well.\n  According to Google Cloud\u2019s DevOps Research &amp; Analysis (DORA)  State of DevOps report, change failure rates (i.e. the percentage of changes in production that result in degraded service and require remediation)\u00a0  can go up to 60% of all new code releases.\u00a0 For elite performers, the failure rate can be kept under 15%, but since this addresses only known errors and is based on self-reporting of engineers (not customers), the actual rates might even be higher.\n The difference between low performers and elite performers is quite high, giving the elite an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d in their ability to innovate and move fast. This explains the results we\u2019ve seen from big tech companies like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Google, although even they are not free from errors.\n A key driver behind this is the ability to release smaller changes at a higher frequency \u2013 but that\u2019s not the only difference. While all companies test in one form or another, how they do it and what they look for varies greatly.\n During a recent live panel, we discussed this issue with the co-hosts of  DevOps Paradox,  Darin Pope, a DevOps Consultant that\u2019s known for making the complex simple, and  Viktor Fracic, a Principal Software Delivery Strategist, Developer Advocate and a published author. Together with  Eric Mizell, OverOps VP of Solution Engineering.\n An on-demand recording of that conversation, including takeaways for balancing speed and quality with Continuous Reliability,  is available here.\n Below are three key takeaways from that conversation that illustrate why traditional testing is not sufficient:\n  Viktor Fracic: \u201cCode coverage means nothing. I don\u2019t understand why people are still obsessed with code coverage. It\u2019s not really about how many tests you have, but the quality of those tests. I\u2019ve seen companies that have close to 100% code coverage but have meaningless tests that don\u2019t prove anything.\n \u201cThose types of metrics to me are very misleading. It\u2019s easy to have 95% test code coverage, but having tests that really matter, having them drive your design, and detect things that are hard to detect, that\u2019s what\u2019s hard. Code coverage doesn\u2019t serve much of a purpose if the tests themselves are not really well done.\u201d\n  Darin Pope: \u201cThis is day-to-day life for most people, I would rather have an error happen in production and go-to-market fast, than build something for 5 years to get it out the door when all market opportunity is lost. I\u2019d rather see people move fast and be comfortable with failing.\u201d\n Viktor Fracic:\u201cIf you do develop for five years and then put it in production, it \u2019s still going to fail. Until you put it in production you don \u2019t really know how it will behave with real users. We \u2019re just trying to get as close to being stable before we put it in production, but once it \u2019s there then we can figure out what \u2019s going on and react quickly to solve problems. But the whole idea that you will be testing, testing, testing and then you say, yes now it \u2019s going to work  ...\n Eric Mizell:\u201cI don \u2019t want to drop in production and fail miserably. But I do want to be able to have the people and processes in place to fix it, because you want to adopt a move fast/fix fast mindset. I want to get it out there fast, because I need to move quicker in today \u2019s world. In a cloud world a new company can spend a day and they could compete with me with something I \u2019ve been working on for five years. I need to figure out how to move fast and continue to move forward  ...\n  Viktor Fracic: \u201cI would say that this was true a long time ago. It\u2019s just that now we are admitting it. And everybody knows that we never deploy stable code in production that never fails or doesn\u2019t have any problems. Every single company in the world 20 years ago was receiving notifications from their users, this or that doesn\u2019t work, and then you need to fix it. We knew all of this, now we\u2019re just admitting the reality.\u201d\n Eric Mizell: \u201cI\u2019ve actually heard a company say that they try to do risk assessment on how risky it is to lose customers and revenue versus getting the software out there. They need new features. It\u2019s a balance. I don\u2019t think anyone has the perfect balance there but you see it happening a ton and it goes back to the notion of I want to be able to move fast/fix fast. How do I come back from a failure is the true challenge.\u201d\n  As developers, we are great at writing code, but inherently limited in the ability to foresee where it will break down later. The task of detecting software issues, either early in testing or later in prod, and gathering information on them should be automated if we ever want to achieve the move fast/fix fast vision.\n That\u2019s the mission we\u2019re tackling here at  OverOps, so if you\u2019re running mission-critical Java or .NET applications, send me a note at alex [at] overops.com, and I\u2019d be happy to chat!\n The on-demand recording of this panel, including takeaways for balancing speed and quality with Continuous Reliability, is available  here.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:56", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,\u4eca\u5929,longer,\u6d4b\u8bd5,testing", "title": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0d\u518d\u8db3\u591f", "title_en": "Why Testing Is No Longer Sufficient for Today\u2019s Software Delivery Pipelines", "transed": 0, "url": "https://blog.overops.com/why-testing-is-no-longer-sufficient-for-todays-software-delivery-pipelines/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "\u4eca\u5929", "longer", "\u6d4b\u8bd5", "testing"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "33f0b4c5652196e1d12aadca9fead569.jpg", "infoid": 1000218, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6458\u8981\u4e00\u65e6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u4e86\u89e3\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u76f4\u90fd\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5462\uff1f\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e86\u89e3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u4ed6\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u662f\u5426\u6709\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf918\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5806\u6808\u6ea2\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5047\u8bbe\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6f5c\u5728\u5730\u5e72\u6270\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u95e8\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u4ece\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u6765\u770b..\u3002\n\u4fc4\u52d2\u5188\u5dde\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u76f8\u53d8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u751f\uff0c\u4fc4\u52d2\u5188\u5dde\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u3002\n\u5bc6\u6b47\u6839\u5927\u5b66\u3001\u52a0\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u5723\u5df4\u5df4\u62c9\u5206\u6821\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bc6\u6b47\u6839\u5927\u5b66\u3001\u5bc6\u6b47\u6839\u5927\u5b66", "note_en": "Abstract Once a programmer knows one language, they can leverage concepts and knowledge already learned, and easily pick up another programming language.

To understand if programmers have difficulty learning additional programming languages, we conducted an empirical study of Stack Overflow questions across 18 different programming languages. We hypothesized that previous knowledge could potentially interfere with learning a new programming language.

a Lyft spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#34;We\u2019re continuing to invest in our bike and scooter business, but have made the tough decision to shift resources away from three scooter markets and toward opportunities where we are set up for longer-term success.&#34;\n In an  email sent to Oakland riders yesterday, Lyft said scooters would no longer be available, effective immediately.\n &#34;Thanks for riding our scooters,&#34; Lyft wrote. &#34;We know it&#39;s tough to let them go. But don&#39;t worry - Lyft is still moving forward in Oakland, and is here to help you get to where you need to go during this time.&#34;\n Lyft has also permanently shut down its operations in  Austin and  San Jose. The decision to shut down permanently in Austin came after Lyft temporarily removed the scooters in mid-March and then brought them back in early April to better serve essential workers.\n Moving forward, Lyft scooters will only be available in Denver, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Monica and Washington, D.C., according to the company&#39;s site. Right now, Lyft&#39;s operations in Miami are still paused.\n Lyft is not the only scooter operator that has been affected during the pandemic. Lime and Bird, for example,  have both paused operations in certain markets. Bird has also similarly faced financial troubles during these times. In March,  Bird laid off about 30% of its workforce.\n But even before the pandemic, Lyft had ceased scooter operations in a number of cities. In November, for example,  Lyft ended its operations in Nashville, San Antonio, Atlanta, the Phoenix area, Dallas and Columbus. At the time, Lyft also laid off 20 employees.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:47", "tags": "\u7ed3\u675f,ends,\u6ed1\u677f\u8f66,lyft", "title":

"note_en": "Last year researchers at Princeton and the University of Chicago   published the results of a study  on so called \u201cdark patterns\u201d. Dark patterns are tactics online businesses use to manipulate users to do things that will make the business more money.\n For example, email capture popups that cannot be minimized or recurring billing schemes that are nearly impossible to cancel.\n While the research concluded they are generally effective, overly aggressive use can cause a backlash that erodes trust and hurts your brand. Some of these tactics might soon be illegal if the   Deceptive Experiences to Online Users Reduction Act  becomes law.\n All this got me thinking about opposite tactics that make me trust a business more. I will call them anti-dark-patterns. Here are a few:\n      Recently, we had to hold one of regular meetups online due to the corona virus. As I already used Zoom for virtual meetings, I looked into using their webinar solution. It was a one-time event and I did not need a recurring webinar solution, so I treaded cautiously to avoid being locked into a forever billing scheme if I forgot to cancel.\n Guess what? They had an option for just one month (see image above), which I checked. I immediately felt that this is a company I could trust. Most others would never offer this option, or if they did, it would be in tiny print at the bottom of the page\u2014or worse yet, require you to go through customer support.\n Later that week, someone on a large forum I belong to asked about webinar solutions. Due to my positive experience, I instantly recommended Zoom to more than 2,000 members. I suspect this kind of word of mouth referral based on trust (as well as product simplicity) has contributed a lot to Zoom\u2019s hockey stick curve growth (they were doing well even before the corona virus).\n     Closely related to 1) above is letting a free trial user know that they will be billed, a few days before the billing date. One company with a 7-day free trial took it even a step further: while letting me know I would be billed soon, they said something along the lines of  \u201cjust in case you need extra time, we\u2019ve thrown in two more free days. You will be billed on the 9  th  day\u201d.  Something about this made me want to pay for at least a month. Before, I was on the borderline.\n     When you buy plane tickets on Google, the headline price shown is the same price at Checkout. This\n makes me trust Google and in the last few years I have not bought my tickets anywhere else!\n  For example, below is a headline price of $197 for a round-trip ticket from Seattle to Dallas:\n      When I click through to the checkout page, it is actually 80 cents cheaper at $196.20. Most importantly, they already included all the taxes and fees in the headline price.\n      Contrast this approach with Pandora\u2019s, when selling concert tickets alongside the current song playing. About a year ago, while listening to a  Boyz II Men song, I noticed an ad for a tour date in Seattle. Intrigued by the low price, I clicked through. By the time I got to the checkout, the price had ballooned to almost 30% to 40% more, with all the taxes, surcharges, convenience fees and god-knows-what other fees! I have never again clicked on a concert ticket sale ad on Pandora.  ...\n      Many a time I have opted in for a free report or eBook only to be hounded by daily emails. I unsubscribe immediately, as I suspect many others do. Unless you are explicitly a daily newsletter kind of business, this is too much email for a new list member to handle.\n  To piggyback on the courtship analogy often used in marketing, it is like going from first date to showing up at her door every day asking if she is ready to do it! You will quickly turn her off, whereas if you had taken it a little slower, a meaningful relationship might have developed.\n    I recall a story told by   Derek Sivers  (I think) about a company that sold music CDs by emailing their list once or twice a week with a recommendation. It was a nice profitable business ran by music enthusiasts who cared about recommending the most relevant CDs for different musical tastes.\n  Then they got acquired and the investors figured: If you make a million a year emailing twice a week, we can make at least three times as much by emailing daily. They gave the marching orders, \u201cfrom now on, send a daily email\u201d. With the original musician owners gone, the suits recommended random CDs which resulted in fewer sales despite a higher email frequency.\n  And in less than a year they were out of business! The listed got burned out from the aggressive promotions and most people no longer opened the emails or simply unsubscribed.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:41", "tags":

"note_en": "While auto-correct frustrates every iPhone user at one time or another, I imagine it\u2019s an insanely complex feature to get right. After using it for 13 years now, I find that I have a list of  small things I\u2019d love to see change rather than a few number of really  big changes.\n I wanted to make this more a list of suggestions that to just rip into auto-correct. Note that I can always keep a very close eye on the completion bar but to have to look at three possible spellings as I type a word is cumbersome.\n  Auto-correct likes to outsmart us by choosing a more common word than we actually typed.\n In some cases, it might be a welcome surprise, but I feel it\u2019s outweighed by the frustration when it changes my valid word. If I really meant the more common one, I can fix it myself and the system will learn over time that it\u2019s a word I use.\n  One variation on this is adding an ending to a valid word. For example, I typed \u201cflummox\u201d (a valid word) and it auto-corrected it to \u201cflummoxed\u201d, probably because it\u2019s a more commonly used word.\n 2) When an auto-capitalized correction is retyped by the user, don\u2019t preserve capitalization\n This is pretty close to the top of my list. Here\u2019s what happens.\n      Auto-correct capitalized \u201cChicago\u201d for me, which is wonderful. But when I changed my sentence, it capitalized the word \u201cWhere\u201d inappropriately. Note you can double-tap \u201cChicago\u201d to get around it, but text editing can be fiddly so I usually just backspace.\n  Note that you can turn off auto-capitalization, but it\u2019s nice to just have the first word capitalized in a sentence and also proper names like Chicago.\n  When I tap the space bar, I sometimes tap it too high and hit a letter in the row above. I\u2019d love auto-correct to see that I\u2019m typing real words, but intermixing c, v, and b in with them. For example:\n    Especially when I\u2019m typing a long word, I use the completion bar more to save time. But many times, it\u2019ll have forms of the word that aren\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for. For example, if I want to type \u201cflummoxes\u201d so I start typing \u201cflummo\u201d and note I don\u2019t get what I want for suggestions.\n  I\u2019m not a UI designer, but I\u2019d love to tap and hold on \u201cflummox\u201d in the completion bar and it would show all the different available forms (singular, plural, tenses, parts of speech). For a long word or one that is difficult to type, it would save time to make sure I type it correctly.\n 5) The hidden \u201cReplace\u2026\u201d the feature works so well; why doesn\u2019t auto-correct use it?\n A lot of people don\u2019t know this, but if you have a misspelled word and it is underlined, you can double-tap on it, choose Replace\u2026 (if present) and you\u2019ll get a number of suggestions.\n In my experience, the suggestions are really, really good and since it\u2019s underlined, they are words that auto-correct couldn\u2019t figure out.\n So why is it that this \u201cReplace\u2026\u201d feature seems to be\u2026 better?\n   If you type 100 words of text, how many words are auto-corrected wrong? I don\u2019t know the answer, but I\u2019d guess about 10. It\u2019s very tedious to fix a bad auto-correction. One way that few people know about is you can use Undo.\n If you don\u2019t mind shaking your phone violently and risking damage, this is a great option. Another might be an Undo button that perhaps appears briefly on screen after an auto-correction takes place. Or squeeze it into the completion bar.\n   Sadly, note that the Undo feature is extremely buggy. Sometimes it highlights the word and the previous space. Other times it highlights everything from 2 corrections ago to the current cursor position.\n  Sometimes I type a whole paragraph, read it over, then realize that there were a number of bad auto-corrections. I think it would be nice if auto-corrected words would be highlighted, either for a short period of time, or until you are finished typing.\n This would allow you to catch errors in context rather than much later. Also, it\u2019ll help identify words that may be more likely to be incorrect depending on your typing style.\n One specific case where this would be useful is where it corrects words earlier than the one you last typed. Typically, your eyes are on the current word and it\u2019s hard to notice things changing before that.\n This works nicely with the Undo feature mentioned above. Imagine hitting Undo multiple times to cycle through auto-corrected words you need to fix.\n  I don\u2019t know how this would work but I find myself wanting a way to temporarily turn off auto-complete. Maybe I\u2019m speaking with someone where we make up words or use words in a subject area that the dictionary is not familiar with. Perhaps we use a lot of acronyms.\n As far as user interface, I don\u2019t know how you would pull this off but I think it\u2019s an interesting idea.\n 9) Make completion bar more obvious what is going to happen when tapping space or return\n I find the completion bar really useful in certain cases, but due to its interface that relies on the typical Apple grey on slightly lighter grey background, I find it hard to understand what the completion bar is supposed to do. There are at least three states I know of.\n     3&gt; I\u2019m going to replace what you typed with the word circled in a slightly lighter grey\n  Since the two \u201ccolors\u201d match the keyboard exactly, I think it\u2019s hard to easily notice #2 and #3 especially. It\u2019s a lot faster to type if you know it\u2019s already guessed your word completely versus it has an idea but is not sure yet, so you need to type more.\n  The original purpose of auto-correct was to correct fat-fingering the keyboard. So, if I type nanana instead of banana, it found a word based on the fact that \u201cn\u201d and \u201cb\u201d are adjacent to each other.\n Nowadays, machine learning is all the rage, and the goal is often to be smarter than the user and choose words it thinks the user meant based on popularity or usage in the past or trending on Twitter.\n For fun, I typed the word \u201ckerfuffle\u201d but I accidentally type \u201ckeffuffle\u201d\u2014a one character difference between two adjacent keys. What does it suggest? Keep. If machines are supposed to learn, this one hasn\u2019t learned that much!\n   When typing fast, sometimes I type a word and a character is missing. I find that auto-correct works well when the typed word is longer, but not shorter. I go back to my \u201ckerfuffle\u201d example. If I type \u201ckerfffle\u201d which is missing the \u201cu\u201d it doesn\u2019t even suggest an alternative.\n I\u2019m no expert, but a word that has 8 out of 9 characters in common and in order at least deserves to be in the suggestions bar.\n  One of the biggest sources of frustration, confusion, embarrassment, and relationship breakups is misinterpreted auto-corrected text.\n I\u2019ll save the best idea for last (in my opinion). What if the recipient could see auto-corrected text highlighted in the message from you! Then if something were weird or unclear, they would know it\u2019s not actually what you typed.\n  1&gt; You could have a way for the recipient to see what was originally typed\n 2&gt; The sender could quickly send a message to the effect of \u201cI said A but really meant B\u201d without having to type all that text\n   As I said at the start, auto-correct is a far harder technology to crack than most people realize. I consider my suggestions to be anywhere from simple to moderate to implement, with a few impossible ones thrown in.\n I think they would do a good job of improving the user experience of auto-correct and make people enjoy using it rather than getting frustrated by it sometimes.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:29", "tags": "\u66f4\u6539,auto,\u5355\u8bcd,word", "title":

"note_en": "There \u2019s nothing that epitomises the attitudes of pre-Revolutionary France quite like the job of executioner. The men in this job served the royal will, dealing out death and torture as decreed by the upper classes. Officially they were esteemed for this role. Unofficially they were despised for it. The aristocrats saw them as tools to be deployed against the lower classes to keep them in line, but they also saw them as members of those lower orders. And so, when the Revolution came, an executioner  ...\n  Like the  Pierrepoints, the Sansons made executions a family trade. This wasn\u2019t really a coincidence. It was difficult to get men to join the ranks of  les Bourreaux, and so the law said that if an executioner could not find an apprentice then his son or son-in-law would have to take their place. The first of them to take up the trade was an impoverished nobleman named Charles Sanson de Longval. He married the daughter of an executioner, either for love (family legend said that she was his nurse after  ...\n The daughter who Charles married died giving birth to their son, also named Charles. This Charles grew up to take on his father \u2019s job, and married a formidable woman named Anne-Marthe. Charles junior died in 1726, leaving behind a seven year old son named Charles-Jean-Baptiste and a five year old son named Nicolas-Charles-Gabriel. Officially Charles-Jean-Baptiste was now the state executioner for Paris, a lucrative position and one that Anne-Marthe Sanson had no intention of giving up. So the  ...\n  Charles-Henri learned at an early age that his family trade was one held in contempt by the world at large. By common arrangement it was never discussed by them at home, and the Sansons only ever spoke of \u201cthe work \u201d. In order to safeguard him from the disgrace of \u201cthe work \u201d, young Charles-Henri was enrolled anonymously at a fairly prestigious school run by the Sisters of Providence of Rouen. There he studied medicine, hoping to be able to escape his family trade. Unfortunately at the age of  ...\n  Initially, like his father, Charles-Henri had to leave the actual executions to \u201cassistants \u201d. In 1757 he himself played assistant to one of the goriest executions of the 18th century, on a man who tried to do what Charles-Henri would become infamous for \u2013regicide. Robert-Fran\u00e7ois Damiens was an unemployed ex-servant who seems to have been suffering from some form of mental illness. He blamed Louis XV for Jansenism (a sect of Catholicism) having been ruled heretical, and so when the King was  ...\n On the morning of the 28th March 1757 Robert-Fran\u00e7ois Damiens was taken to a scaffold in the center of Paris. There a massive crowd (which included the infamous Casanova) were witness to him being subjected to literally medieval tortures. The official executioner was Charles-Henri \u2019s uncle, Nicolas-Charles-Gabriel Sanson. Charles-Henri and several others assisted. From the outside it was terrifying, but from the inside it was almost farcical. France \u2019s last regicide had been in 1610, and the  ...\n  Nicolas-Charles-Gabriel retired after the Damiens execution, it apparently being one step too far for him. Charles-Henri, on the other hand, seems to have had the opposite reaction. Far from putting him off his trade, the gruesome event inured him to it. No other job could be so bad after it. That wasn \u2019t to say it was smooth sailing. One notable incident came in 1766 when an old friend of his father \u2019s was the subject of \u201cthe work \u201d. Thomas Arthur, the comte de Lally, was a French nobleman  ...\n Thomas Arthur and Madame Tiquet were both high-born, which is why they rated decapitation as their method of execution. Most other criminals were hanged, though those whose crimes were considered more heinous rated more elaborate forms of death. Heretics were burned, counterfeiters were boiled alive and murderers faced being \u201cbroken on the wheel \u201d. They were lashed to a circular wheel and had their limbs broken with an iron bar before being finished off. As the more compassionate ideals of  ...\n  Leading the charge was Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, a doctor who had been elected as one of the deputies for Paris to the General Assembly in 1789. Guillotin was actually against the death penalty on principal, but thought that the first step would be to make the process as painless as possible. He proposed a motion that all death sentences should be decapitations carried out by mechanical means. The motion was passed. The decapitation machine was originally called a \u201clouisette \u201d, after its designer  ...\n Charles-Henri Sanson was a huge advocate of the guillotine, though his motives may have been slightly selfish. Not only would it make his job a lot easier, but it would also mean that he would no longer need to maintain a vast array of execution tools. He took on the job of testing the prototype, starting with straw bales. These were followed by living sheep and then human corpses. The machine was declared a success and the first official guillotine was created by Tobias Schmidt, a maker  ...\n  At first glance, you might have expected the French Revolution to have been bad news for Charles-Henri. Here was a man who dealt out death on behalf of the upper classes, after all. He was well-paid; enough that his fancy green coats actually set a fashion at court. And he was descended from a noble family. But the Revolution was not the sudden violent upheaval that popular imagination portrays. It began with social reform, and it was middle-class artisans like the Sansons who were at the  ...\n It was no light thing to execute a king. When King Charles of England was executed, his executioner \u2019s identity was a closely held secret. And in validation of that secrecy, after the Restoration every member of Parliament who had voted for his execution was tracked down and themselves executed in far more tortuous fashion. Charles \u2019executioner had been either Irish or Scottish, too. [1] But the principles of the Republic meant that it was important to them that Louis be executed by a  ...\n  The execution took place in January of 1793. It was a gloomy damp morning, and reportedly the King was silent except for some prayers on his two-hour coach ride to the scaffold. Once he arrived there was some confusion, which led to a rumour that the king had tried to fight his way free. This wasn \u2019t true though, and apparently was due to the king \u2019s protests when he found out that his hands were to be bound with a length of rope. His confessor persuaded him (by pointing out that Jesus  ...\n That same blood now bound Charles-Henri Sanson to the Revolution, which had much more need of his services as the frenzy of execution known as \u201cthe Reign of Terror \u201dwent into full swing. In the first half of 1793 the Committee of Public Safety took power, and over the course of the year the number of those sent to the guillotine grew larger and larger. The victims were not just nobles left over from the Revolution, now they included the political opponents of Robespierre and his cronies.  ...\n  The end of Robespierre led to the end of the Terror, as the new government sought to disassociate themselves from the excesses of the previous regime. The death penalty remained, however, and \u201cth work \u201dcontinued. Charles-Henri Sanson retired in 1795, handing over his position to his younger son Henri. Both of Charles-Henri \u2019s sons had followed into his trade but the eldest and original heir, Gabriel, had died in a workplace accident several years earlier. While holding a head up to  ...\n In his retirement Charles-Henri retained a macabre celebrity. One famous story is that he was visited by Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon asked him if the people he had killed as an executioner weighed on his conscience. Charles-Henri joked:\n  Napoleon \u2019s response was not recorded. Charles-Henri continued in his retirement until 1806, when his ill-health caught up with him and he died. Henri continued as the High Executioner of Paris until 1839, when he was replaced by his own son Henri-Clement. Henri-Clement was the last Sanson to be an executioner, and the story of how he lost his job is somewhat sordid. He was always a spendthrift, and deep in debt he wound up either selling or pawning his guillotine, which dated back  ...\n  [1] There were three men who were picked as executioner, and only they knew which one wielded the axe. Famously one went to live in Galway afterwards where he used the money to establish a pub, amusingly titled \u201cThe King\u2019s Head\u201d.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:22", "tags":

"note_en": "NASA on Thursday awarded three companies contracts to build spacecraft capable of landing humans on the moon, sparking a new space race that NASA hopes will propel the United States back to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972.\n Blue Origin, the  space outfit owned by Jeff Bezos; Dynetics, a subsidiary of Leidos, a Reston, Va.-based information technology firm; and  Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX won contracts, giving NASA three options that would compete against each other as NASA scrambles to meet an ambitious White House mandate to put humans on the moon by 2024. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n Boeing, typically among NASA\u2019s key contractors but whose space program has experienced multiple setbacks and delays,  also submitted a bid but was not selected.\n  In an interview with The Washington Post, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said he remains confident NASA will be  able to meet the 2024 deadline, even though the first flight of the Space Launch System, the Boeing-built rocket that would launch astronauts to the moon, will be  pushed back again, this time to November 2021.\n  Still, the announcement of contracts for the landers \u2014 the first lunar spacecraft contracts NASA has awarded since the 1960s\u2019 Apollo era \u2014 is a significant step toward getting the U.S. crews to the moon quickly and building what NASA hopes will become a permanent presence on the moon\u2019s surface.\n A lunar landing is \u201cstarting to feel very, very real,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. There have been lots of attempts to go back to the moon since 1972, but none have materialized.\u201d\n   It\u2019s not clear yet, however, that NASA\u2019s latest effort, dubbed \u201cArtemis\u201d after the twin sister of Apollo, will materialize, either.\n To give itself a better shot at pulling off the feat by 2024, NASA has changed its plans. Initially NASA was going to fly its astronauts to an outpost in orbit around the moon, known as the Gateway. From there, they would descend to the lunar surface. But now NASA says that while it remains committed to the Gateway for the long term, it will likely not use it for the next moon landing.\n  Instead it intends to fly  astronauts in the Orion spacecraft, built by Lockheed Martin, to lunar orbit, where it would meet up and dock with the lander, which would take them to the moon\u2019s surface. Still, NASA officials said, the plan could change.\n  For a moon landing to become a reality, however, NASA and the White House must sell their plan to a skeptical Congress, which has not yet signed off on a program projected to  cost $35 billion through 2024. NASA and Boeing, the prime contractor on the SLS program, also must make significant progress on the rocket. A recent Government Accountability Office report said that despite years of development, the rocket \u201cmay develop leaks when it is filled with fuel. \u201dAnother recent report, by the  ...\n  NASA also is struggling to get to the moon under a drastically expedited timeline. Initially it was planning to land humans on the moon by 2028. But Vice President Pence last year directed the space agency to do it by 2024 \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d\n  Despite the many challenges, the plan is attainable, Douglas Loverro,  NASA\u2019s head of human spaceflight, said in an interview.\n  \u201cThis is a first giant step, but it\u2019s only the first step,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have so much work ahead of us. Now the hard part begins. And it\u2019s going to take the best of NASA and the best of industry to get there.\u201d\n NASA officials declined to comment on Boeing\u2019s absence from the list. The loss for the aerospace behemoth comes as it has struggled not only with the SLS rocket, but with the Starliner spacecraft it is developing to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station in low Earth orbit. A recent test mission without crews onboard went so badly that the  company decided to refly the flight.\n  For Blue Origin, the contract award is a major victory. Founded in 2000 by Bezos, the company has for years been urging the space agency to return to the moon, specifically the south pole, where scientists have discovered water in the form of ice.\n  Blue has been pitching its lander,  called Blue Moon, since 2017, and Bezos has said he would invest heavily in it himself. Last year,  Blue Origin announcedit was teaming up on the project with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper \u2014\u201ca national team for a national priority, \u201dBezos said. \u201cThis is the kind of thing that \u2019s so ambitious that it needs to be done with partners. This is the only way to get back to the moon fast. We \u2019re not going back to the moon to visit. We \u2019re going  ...\n   Bob Smith, Blue Origin\u2019s CEO, said at a news conference that the effort would \u201chumbly stand on the shoulders of Apollo. \u2026 I know I speak for many on our team that going to the moon is the reason why we got into this business, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about that.&#34;\n NASA said that  Blue Origin was furthest alongwith its project and awarded it the largest award, $579 million. Dynetics, which has paired with the Sierra Nevada Corp., would receive $253 million and scored the highest marks, according to NASA \u2019s source selection document. SpaceX, which bid its Starship spacecraft, won $135 million. The contracts are for the first stage of the program and would last through February 2021. After that, NASA could decide whether to proceed with all three  ...\n  The award was the latest in a string of wins for SpaceX, which is poised to fly  NASA\u2019s astronauts to the space station on May 27. NASA had previously awarded SpaceX a contract, worth as much as $7 billion, to resupply the Gateway with cargo.\n   During the news conference Musk said the announcement would ultimately help move humanity into deep space. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got potential for an incredibly exciting future in space, with a base on the moon and ultimately sending people and having a self-sustaining city on Mars,\u201d he said.\n While the Gateway likely won\u2019t be used for the next lunar landing, Bridenstine said the agency is \u201c100 percent committed to the Gateway. That being said, we are also committed to going as fast as possible.\u201d\n Bridenstine said SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket could be used to launch the habitat and power and propulsion elements of an orbiting space station after they are assembled on the ground.\n  Though the astronauts would only be on the surface of the moon for a number of days, as in Apollo, the goal would be to study the region around the moon\u2019s south pole to help NASA set up a permanent presence there. NASA is particularly interested in the ice discovered in the perpetually shadowed craters, and how it could be used to sustain life and even be converted into rocket fuel.\n  \u201cI view this as learning to fly to the moon again and learning the right way so we can do it again and again,\u201d Loverro said. \u201cThis is not a flash in the pan. It is the first step of many steps we\u2019re going to take there.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:18", "tags": "blue,nasa", "title": "SpaceX\uff0cBlue

"note_en": "Yesterday, I learned that we\u2019re closing down Cliqz\u2014the company I worked for since 2017. I\u2019m digesting this heavy news by reflecting on what I learned during this time and the lessons I\u2019d like to carry with me for my career.\n  Cliqz is a tech company from Munich, Germany. Chestnut trees surround our office. Every Thursday there\u2019s a local farmers\u2019 market in front of our building. (Missing this and the grilled chicken smell especially now during Corona lock-down). We\u2019re around seventy people\u2014mostly engineers. Most of them are called Alexander, Alexandra, Alexei, or Alex. Our coffee machine breaks every two months\u2014about the same time as our backend.\n  We set for ourselves the mission to build a better way to search and browse the Internet. We decided against the easy way to piggyback on already existing technology. Which means that we\u2019re building our very own search engine from scratch. For almost seven years, we\u2019ve been relentlessly working on it. Until yesterday.\n    Cliqz lost the fight against Google. There\u2019s no way to sugarcoat this. This gigantic tech monopoly left no room for a small, privacy-centric competitor from Europe to innovate and bring up new ideas. If Cliqz is not taking up the fight \u2014 who else is? If we never even try to change a system or come up with something new, we\u2019re never going to make a change.\n  Cliqz\u2019s mission wasn\u2019t wrong. Our technology wasn\u2019t wrong. We just didn\u2019t have enough support to pull it off.\n This is a wake-up call. Dear politicians, investors, and consumers:  Support companies that support you. Help them to help you.\n We all have choices, as individuals and as corporate entities. I will use mine wisely. My attention will now more than ever go to companies that offer products and services that want to make a positive change, for our democracy, for our planet, for our economy.  I\u2019ll try my best to pick David over Goliath. What will you do?\n   When you work in a creative role like I did at Cliqz as a Brand Manager, you\u2019ll always experience pushbacks on your ideas. A big part of my job was to come up with new\u2014sometimes weirdly good and sometimes plain stupid\u2014ideas to reach people. Some of the back-burner ideas were: Changing the Cliqz name, turning the browser colors to pick for Valentine\u2019s day, advertising on porn websites (okay, that one made it).\n As the nature of a creative job is, there will always be people who don\u2019t like your idea. How to deal with that?\n  First, walk a mile in their shoes. See it from their perspective. Is there something you can learn from this place of empathy? Secondly, focus your attention and energy on the people who are in favor of your idea and take it from there. Usually, excitement creates more excitement. Soon enough, you\u2019ll have many more people joining in and fueling your idea with useful recommendations and feedback.\n   Most people who work for Cliqz are the very best in their field\u2014browsers, search engines, privacy. These are highly intelligent tech experts. I worked in the Marketing department.  Sometimes it felt like we were speaking entirely different languages. Emoji vs. Python.\n  I wasn\u2019t used to a company that is so strongly driven by tech. We innovated because we could. We went the extra mile for our users because it was the right thing to do\u2014even if nobody would ever notice or appreciate it.\n  A cynic might say that Cliqz failed because of our strong passion for technology and a missing drive from business development. If I were presented with the choice, I\u2019d always choose to work with highly intelligent\u2014sometimes a bit stubborn\u2014tech experts. Their motivation comes from a place of honesty and authenticity and is not driven by pure profit and growth.\n    Cliqzers know one thing: How to party. We were incredibly lucky to have a dedicated Talent and Culture team that pulled off the most incredible events and parties for us.\u00a0I will probably not be this lucky in the future but what I learned is:  Take a break. Dance it off. Celebrate your victories more than you wallow your failures. Grab your colleagues and go for walks. Complement and appreciate each other for your achievements.\n  I\u2019m incredibly thankful for this crazy ride and my team that feels like a family to me. I\u2019m thankful for fearless, honest, and vulnerable leadership, especially from the Marketing leader Corina Cristal. I poured so much of myself into Cliqz and I\u2019m not regretting any of it. This is the way I\u2019d like to work in the future:  With passion, empathy, and a challenge that seems way too big.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 17:59:04", "tags": "cliqz", "title": "Cliqz\u6b63\u5728\u5173\u95ed", "title_en": "Cliqz is shutting down", "transed": 0, "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-i-learned-cliqz-victoria-gassmann/", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["cliqz"]}]
