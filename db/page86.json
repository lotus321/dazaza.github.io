"note_en": "Incremental And Continuous Updates.When writing to an SQLite database file, only those parts of the file thatactually change are written out to disk. This makes the writing happen fasterand saves wear on SSDs. This is an enormous advantage over customand wrapped pile-of-files formats, both of which usually require arewrite of the entire document in order to change a single byte. Pure pile-of-files formats can alsodo incremental updates to some extent, though the granularity of writes is usually larger with pile-of-file formats (a single file) than with SQLite(a single page). SQLite also supports continuous update.Instead of collecting changes in memory and then writingthem to disk only on a File/Save action, changes can be written back tothe disk as they occur. This avoids loss of work on a system crash orpower failure. An  automated undo/redo stack, managed using triggers,can be kept in the on-disk database, meaning that undo/redo can occur across session boundaries. Easily Extensible.As an application grows, new features can be added to anSQLite application file format simply by adding new tables to the schemaor by adding new columns to existing tables. Adding columns or tablesdoes not change the meaning of prior queries, so with a modicum of care to ensuring that the meaning of legacy columns andtables are preserved, backwards compatibility is maintained. It is possible to extend custom or pile-of-files formats too, of course,but doing is often much harder. If indices are added, then all applicationcode that changes the corresponding tables must be located and modified tokeep those indices up-to-date. If columns are added, then all applicationcode that accesses the corresponding table must be located and modified to take into account the new columns. Performance.In many cases, an SQLite application file format will be  faster than a pile-of-files format ora custom format. In addition to being faster for raw read andwrites, SQLite can often dramatically improves start-up times because instead of having toread and parse the entire document into memory, the application cando queries to extract only the information needed for the initial screen.As the application progresses, it only needs to load as much material asis needed to draw the next screen, and can discard information fromprior screens that is no longer in use. This helps keep the memoryfootprint of the application under control. A pile-of-files format can be read incrementally just like SQLite.But many developers are surprised to learn that SQLite can read and write smaller BLOBs (less than about 100KB in size) from its database faster than those same blobs can be read or written as separate files from the filesystem. (See 35% Faster Than The Filesystem and Internal Versus External BLOBs for further information.)There is overhead associated with operating a relationaldatabase engine, however one should not assume that direct file I/Ois faster than SQLite database I/O, as often it is not. In either case, if performance problems do arise in an SQLite application those problems can often be resolved by adding one or two  CREATE INDEXstatements to the schema or perhaps running  ANALYZE one timeand without having to touch a single line ofapplication code. But if a performance problem comes up in a custom or pile-of-files format, the fix will often require extensive changesto application code to add and maintain new indices or to extract information using different algorithms. Concurrent Use By Multiple Processes.SQLite automatically coordinates concurrent access to the samedocument from multiple threads and/or processes. Two or moreapplications can connect and read from the same document at thesame time. Writes are serialized, but as writes normally onlytake milliseconds, applications simply take turns writing.SQLite automatically ensures that the low-level format of thedocument is uncorrupted. Accomplishing the same with a customor pile-of-files format, in contrast, requires extensive supportin the application. And the application logic needed to supportconcurrency is a notorious bug-magnet. Multiple Programming Languages.Though SQLite is itself written in ANSI-C, interfaces exist forjust about every other programming language you can think of:C++, C#, Objective-C, Java, Tcl, Perl, Python, Ruby, Erlang,JavaScript, and so forth. So programmers can develop in whateverlanguage they are most comfortable with and which best matchesthe needs of the project. An SQLite application file format is a great choice in cases where there is a collection or &#34;federation&#34; ofseparate programs, often written in different languages and bydifferent development teams.This comes up commonly in research or laboratoryenvironments where one team is responsible for data acquisitionand other teams are responsible for various stages of analysis.Each team can use whatever hardware, operating system,programming language and development methodology that they are most comfortable with, and as long as all programs use an SQLite database with a common schema, they can all interoperate. Better Applications.If the application file format is an SQLite database, the completedocumentation for that file format consists of the database schema,with perhaps a few extra words about what each table and columnrepresents. The description of a custom file format,on the other hand, typically runs on for hundreds of pages. A pile-of-files format, while much simpler and easier todescribe than a fully custom format, still tends to be much largerand more complex than an SQL schema dump, since the names and formatfor the individual files must still be described. This is not a trivial point. A clear, concise, and easy to understandfile format is a crucial part of any application design.Fred Brooks, in his all-time best-selling computer science text, The Mythical Man-Month says: Representation is theessence of computer programming. ... Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won&#39;t usuallyneed your flowcharts; they&#39;ll be obvious.\n Rob Pike, in his Rules of Programming expresses the same idea this way: Data dominates. If you&#39;ve chosen the right data structuresand organized things well, the algorithms will almost alwaysbe self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are centralto programming.\n Linus Torvalds used different words to saymuch the same thing on the Git mailing list on 2006-06-27:   The point is this: an SQL database schema almost always does a far better job of defining and organizing the tables and data structures and their relationships.And having clear, concise, and well-defined representationalmost always results in an application that performs better,has fewer problems, and is easier to develop and maintain.", "posttime": "2020-06-13 21:54:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "sqlite,\u7a0b\u5e8f,app,\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f,application", "title": "SQLite\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6587\u4ef6\u683c\u5f0f", "title_en": "SQLite as an Application File Format", "transed": 1, "url": "https://sqlite.org/appfileformat.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["sqlite", "\u7a0b\u5e8f", "app", "\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a6873e74094b8fb6f454abcb4d6fc878.jpg", "infoid": 1006410, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u82f9\u679c\u6700\u8fd1\u5df2\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u6765\u81ea\u6587\u5b57\u94f8\u9020\u5382\u7684\u5b57\u4f53\uff0c\u5982Commercial Type\uff0cKlim Type Foundry\u548cMark Simonson Studio\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3aMac OS Catalina\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b57\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b57\u4f53\u662f\u53ef\u9009\u4e0b\u8f7d\u7684\uff0c\u8bb8\u591aMacOSX\u7528\u6237\u751a\u81f3\u6ca1\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u514d\u8d39\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\n\u8981\u67e5\u770b\u548c\u5b89\u88c5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53ef\u9009\u5b57\u4f53\uff0c\u8bf7\u6253\u5f00FontBook\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5e76\u5207\u6362\u5230\u201c\u6240\u6709\u5b57\u4f53\u201d\u3002\u6d4f\u89c8\u5b57\u4f53\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u770b\u5230\u8bb8\u591a\u5448\u7070\u8272\u7684\u5b57\u4f53\u7cfb\u5217-\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u88ab\u505c\u7528\u4e86\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0b\u8f7d\u3002\u5982\u679c\u53f3\u952e\u5355\u51fb\u5c1a\u672a\u4e0b\u8f7d\u7684\u5b57\u4f53\u6216\u5b57\u4f53\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u60a8\u4f1a\u770b\u5230\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5355\u4e2a\u5b57\u4f53\u6216\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u9009\u9879\u3002\n\u9664\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u62c9\u4e01\u5b57\u4f53\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u975e\u62c9\u4e01\u5b57\u4f53\u53ef\u7528\u3002\u6709\u5173\u5b8c\u6574\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u8bf7\u67e5\u770b\u6b64\u652f\u6301\u6587\u6863\u3002/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210192/\u261e\u3002\n\u60a8\u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u7a0d\u540e\u518d\u6ce8\u518c\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u6709\u5e10\u6237\uff0c\u8bf7\u7acb\u5373\u767b\u5f55\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u60a8\u7684\u5e10\u6237\u53d1\u5e16\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a\u60a8\u7684\u5e16\u5b50\u9700\u8981\u7248\u4e3b\u6279\u51c6\u624d\u80fd\u663e\u793a\u3002", "note_en": "Apple has recently licensed fonts from type foundries such as Commercial Type,\u00a0Klim Type Foundry and Mark Simonson Studio to be used as system fonts on Mac OS Catalina.

"note_en": "On clock dials you find the numbers from 1 to 12 \u2014 but for a bit of a change, could you write those numbers in a different way?\n  The answer is yes. For example, you can write   as   or   or   by using the sum, the product, or by raising to a power. If you like the number   you could also write   as   by using the  ceiling function, which approximates   from above with the closest integer. There are infinitely many possibilities for expressing the number  , and which one is the best is a matter of personal preference. In general, you can produce your own exclusive mathematical clock by writing   to   in your favourite way.\n If you are looking for something extremely fancy, you can use  Euler&#39;s identity to express   using the numbers  ,  , and the imaginary number  :\n Or, if you like the  Basel problem you could display   as the sum of all reciprocals of the squares of the positive multiples of    For something more concrete, you can pick any digit from   to   and express the numbers on the clock dial only with this digit and mathematical symbols (some examples are provided in the images  below).\n Much more generally, it is possible to write the integers from   to   by using only any given real number and mathematical symbols. The reason is that we can always find a suitable expression for the number  . Indeed, for a positive real number which is at most  , it suffices to take the ceiling function (ie taking the integer approximation from above) to produce  . For any real number   greater than   we can write   as the floor function of   (ie taking the integer approximation from below of the  -th root of the number  ), as can be checked with the logarithmic identity\n  Finally, negative numbers may be turned positive with the absolute value, and for   one may use the factorial identity  .\n There are plenty of mathematical clocks in circulation with various expressions on the clock dial. Occasionally, rather than having the numbers from   to  , you find the first twelve terms of some sequence. For example, you may have the first twelve  Fibonacci numbers:\n Another option is writing down an equation such that the desired number is the only solution, for example conveying   with\n  Some mathematical clocks show equations with more than one solution, but with exactly one solution among the integers from   to  . In general, beware of mathematical inaccuracies in mathematical clocks (for example   is not really  )!\n Nevertheless, everything is allowed to have fun playing with numbers. We challenge you to produce your own mathematical clock, but if you need some inspiration here are some examples.\n   In the image gallery below you find various mathematical clocks, with alternative ways of writing the numbers from   to  . You can print out one of those images and use it as a clock dial (e.g. you buy a clock with a custom dial), or you can simply place selected numbers&#39; expressions above or around your clock. You can also buy clocks that you can write on, which allow you to change your mathematical clock at leisure.\n   Fix any decimal digit from   to   and then display all integers   to   with short expressions involving only that digit and some arithmetic operations. We use the basic arithmetic operations, taking powers, and taking the square-root.\n Here is an example of a 7 clock. Examples for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are given  below (notice that with the digits 5, 6, and 7 we only use the basic arithmetic operations).\n   It is possible to write all integers from   to   using only the digits  , ,  exactly once and in this order. We use the basic arithmetic operations, taking powers, taking the square-root, taking the factorial (the factorial of a natural number  , denoted by  , is defined as the product of all natural numbers from   to  ), and applying the floor function   (this function approximates a real number with the closest integer from below).\n   It is possible to write all integers from   to   using only the number  , the basic arithmetic operations, and the floor/ceiling functions   and   (these functions approximate a real number with the closest integer from below and above, respectively).\n   It is

"note_en": "WELCOME TO THE FANTASY WORLD MASTER LIST OF RESOURCES ON HOW TO DISMANTLE SYSTEMIC RACISM\n   As a response to prevalent racial injustices around our country, I&#39;ve decided to create a community sourced database to help my followers - and the internet at large - fight systemic racism and white supremacy.\n  I started  Patia&#39;s Fantasy World as a private page to share humor, focused on black culture, with my close friends. Eventually, I made the page public and amassed a following. With help from a close network of friends and colleagues, as well as several sleepless nights, I created a master list guide to help dismantle racism. Through my platform, the guide has been circulated around the internet, reaching a number of people I never imagined.\n  Due to the overwhelming response, we have turned the master list into a website that we hope will continue to foster awareness and support for the Black Lives Matter movement.\n   What makes a community healthy and safe? This document doesn&#39;t have all the answers, but it acknowledges that for many of us, police are not part of the solution. Patterns of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and bullying are too common. When someone is having a mental health crisis, or when neighbors are concerned about a fellow neighbor, or when we feel unsafe- are the police our only option? Of course, different communities have different needs. Vibrant, dynamic, and police-free communities aren&#39;t going to be created by outside groups- they&#39;re going to bloom from the soil that already exists in those spaces. What we can share here, though, is what that process has looked like elsewhere. Here are a few tools, ideas, and strategies:\n  1. An easy one: STOP calling the police when it&#39;s clearly unnecessary. We can&#39;t tell you to never call the police (though some do make that choice). We can challenge you, however, to reflect on that choice, to make sure that calling them isn&#39;t an automatic response to each and every moment of personal discomfort or uncertainty. Never forget: an inconvenience for one person, once police are involved, can become a death sentence for another person.\n  2. Get trained in first aid, crisis de-escalation, restorative justice, etc. The more skills we have to share with our neighbors and family, the less we have to rely on unaccountable armed paramilitary forces! Find or organize local trainings, and share that knowledge.\n  3. Build community all the time, not just in times of trouble. It isn&#39;t just about building capacity as individuals; it&#39;s about cultivating resilient communities. One of the first steps we can take toward communities that no longer need police is meeting one another. We can know our neighbor&#39;s names. We can hold potlucks, volunteer to help our neighbors with simple things like shoveling snow or carrying groceries, and build real relationships. That way, when crises happen, we have other resources to call upon besides the police.\n  4. If you DO need police, go to them instead of calling them to you. From the zine, &#34;12 Things to Do Instead of Calling the Cops:&#34; If something of yours is stolen and you need to file a report for insurance or other purposes, consider going to the police station instead of bringing cops into your community. You may inadvertently be putting someone in your neighborhood at risk.\n  5. With mental health crises, remember to center the person in crisis. From the article &#34;5 Ways to Help Someone in a Mental Health Emergency Without Calling the Police&#34; (Tastrom):  Remember that the person having the mental health crisis is a person and their wishes should be followed as much as is safe. The best intervention strategies will be things that the person buys into and does voluntarily. Those of us with mental health issues have likely been traumatized by doctors and other practitioners not listening to us or doing things against our will. All of this is contextual and there are no absolutes, but think about trauma when you are considering what actions to take.\n  6. Make a list of local services/hotlines you can call instead of the police. From domestic abuse crisis centers, to shelters for people experiencing homelessness, to mental health support groups, to a range of other kinds of advocates and service-providers, find the people who can deal with the kinds of crises that police so often are not equipped to handle. Find out which ones involve the police as a matter of protocol, and which ones don&#39;t. Hang the list on your refrigerator. Keep those contacts in your phone. Make copies and give them to friends and neighbors.\n  7. Support organizations that really do keep our communities healthy. On that note: where these services exist, support them, whether by volunteering, donating, or lobbying for funding from city/county/etc. government. Some great alternatives to the police already exist; they&#39;re just often extremely underfunded. Take this a step further: how might we strategically re-allocate resources from police to services that truly help people? Campaigns to divest from police while investing in communities may offer a path forward.\n  8. Zoom in and find solutions where you are. Across the country, activists are finding ways to change the narrative and do this work. Teachers and parents are working on campaigns like Dignity in Schools&#39; &#34;Counselors Not Cops.&#34; LGBTQ groups are disinviting police to Pride parades. Formerly-incarcerated people are organizing networks of mentorship and even unarmed community mediation teams. Organizations like the Sex Workers Outreach Project are working to address stigma and criminalization. Churches are pledging to not call the police. From the decriminalization of drugs, to the dismantling of the school-to-prison pipeline, to abolishing ICE, and beyond- every step gets us closer to a police-free future.\n  9. Engage in policy work that can prevent, rather than just punish, crime. When we ask people &#34;what keeps your community healthy and safe?&#34; the answers we hear are often very similar: affordable housing, jobs, youth programs, opportunities to create and experience art, welcoming parks, etc. We can cultivate safer and healthier neighborhoods by getting involved in activist organizations, neighborhood groups, school boards, etc. that have the power to do this preventative work.\n  10. Dream bigger: there was a time before police, and there will be a time after. Some of the solutions we need don&#39;t exist yet. There are some things we can do now, but this work is also about planting seeds. A vital first step toward a police-free future is simply being able to visualize what that future will look like. We must break out of the old mindset that police are this inevitable, irreplaceable part of society. They aren&#39;t. There are better ways for us to keep our communities healthy and safe, ways that do not include the violent, oppressive, unaccountable baggage of police forces. Check out the various sources mentioned here. Do more research, have more conversations, and help build the world in which you want to live.\n  A lot of people have been reaching out to me to see how they can help if they are unable to come out and protest alongside these revolutionaries so me and some friends took the time to create a list of things you could do. Get in where you fit in. Everyone plays a role in the revolution.\n  Calling the police often escalates situations, puts people at risk, and leads to violence. Anytime you seek help from the police, you&#39;re inviting them into your community and putting people who may already be vulnerable into dangerous situations. Sometimes people feel that calling the police is the only way to deal with problems. But we can build trusted networks of mutual aid that allow us to better handle conflicts ourselves and move toward forms of transformative justice, while keeping police away from our neighborhoods.\t\t\t\t 1. Don&#39;t feel obligated to defend property-especially corporate &#34;private&#34; property. Before confronting someone or contacting the police, ask yourself if anyone is being hurt or endangered by property &#34;theft&#34; or damage. If the answer is &#34;no,&#34; then let it be.\n  2. If something of yours is stolen and you need to file a report for insurance or other purposes, consider going to the police station instead of bringing cops into your community. You may inadvertently be putting someone in your neighborhood at risk.\n  3. If you observe someone exhibiting behavior that seems &#34;odd&#34; to you, don&#39;t assume that they are publicly intoxicated. A traumatic brain injury or a similar medical episode may be occurring. Ask if they are OK, if they have a medical condition, and if they need assistance.\n  4. If you see someone pulled over with car trouble, stop and ask if they need help or if you can call a tow truck for them. If the police are introduced to such a situation, they may give punitive and unnecessary tickets to people with car issues, target those without papers, or worse.\n  5. Keep a contact list of community resources like suicide hotlines. When police are contacted to &#34;manage&#34; such situations, people with mental illness are sixteen times more likely to be killed by cops than those without mental health challenges.\n  6. Check your impulse to call the police on someone you believe looks or is acting &#34;suspicious.&#34; Is their race, gender, ethnicity, class, or housing situation influencing your choice? Such calls can be death sentences for many people.\n  7. Encourage teachers, coworkers, and organizers to avoid inviting police into classrooms, workplaces, and public spaces. Instead, create for a culture of taking care of each other and not unwittingly putting people in harm&#39;s way. If you&#39;re part of a group that&#39;s holding a rally or demonstration, don&#39;t get a permit or otherwise cooperate with the police.\n  8. If your neighbor is having a party and the noise is bothering you, go over and talk to them. Getting to know your neighbors with community events like monthly block parties is a good way to make asking them to quiet down a little less uncomfortable, or to find another neighbor who is willing to do so.\n  9. If you see someone peeing in public, just look away! Remember, for example, that many houseless people do not have reliable access to bathrooms.\n  10. Hold and attend deescalation, conflict resolution, first-aid, volunteer medic, and self-defense workshops in your neighborhood, school, workplace, or community organization.\n  11. Street art is beautiful! Don&#39;t report graffiti and other street artists. If you see work that includes fascistic or hate speech, paint over it yourself or with friends.\n  12. Remember that police can escalate domestic violence situations. You can support friends and neighbors who are being victimized by abusers by offering them a place to stay, a ride to a safe location, or to watch their children. Utilize community resources like safe houses and hotlines.\n  Pay the Rent Aboriginal people should have control of any Rent received.

Our identification approach exploits regional variation in the point in time when face masks became compulsory. Depending on the region we analyse, we find that face masks reduced the cumulative number of registered Covid-19 cases between 2.3% and 13% over a period of 10 days after they became compulsory. Assessing the credibility of the various estimates, we conclude that face masks reduce the daily growth rate of reported infections by around 40%.", "posttime": "2020-06-13 20:28:58", "source_domain":

"note_en": "Hi! My names Germ and I make really tiny and strange keyboards. Currently on a 36 key keyboard! How did this happen?    10 years ago, at my high school I found this behemoth of a keyboard. I didn&#39;t know anything about it all I knew is that this thing weighed about 5lbs and was louder then all hell. The worst part is that it even  felt really good to use. Of course what we had dug out of the CS closet was a old dusty IBM Model M.    It got used for a few months in the lab before I lost a connector and decided to pare down my electronics before taking off to university. Somewhere in the next few years the space bar got damaged and I pitched it. For the next few years this became my weapon of choice, mostly because it was bolted to the damn laptop.    And it was good enough. OSX had a little option for swapping caps and control and that alleviated most of the issues I had. It got me through school, programming and working on various projects. It wasn&#39;t amazing or anything but with a few remaps using Karabiner (I think that&#39;s the program) and software drag scrolling with my M570 Trackball it worked. With a Autohotkey setup and Xinput/Xmodmap file for cross OS support configuration was a pain point, but manageable. That is until I met a Mainframe and ISPF.   This is the primary interface for z/OS, straight 1980s vibe right? Unsurprisingly this isn&#39;t going to play nice with a tiny laptop keyboard. Hell the interface expects PF24 in places! We needed to go bigger, and that&#39;s when I bought a old mechanical keyboard off a friend and gave it the 5 minute custom. This managed to get me through Master The Mainframe and even make a neat little react frontend for a Cobol/DB2 database with a JSON API (fun fact JSON GENERATE and JSON PARSE were added a few years ago, and there&#39;s even VSCode support for COBOL :) But the main issue was transporting this thing to work, it&#39;s not a small board by any means! But with the Windows only software you could do some neat remapping and macroing so I looked into programmable keyboards.     This is what happened. A split open source keyboard powered by this thing called QMK with blank keys to boot. This is where things started to get messy, QMK is a amazing project that lets you write custom keymaps, generate a firmware and flash it over to a supporting device. Because it&#39;s aimed at a technical crowd this is done through some C macro shenanigans (although there is a web configurator that will spit out a compiled hex for you to flash). After about a week of getting used to the default layout, I found  this\u00a0a layout more aimed at Linux/Vim users gave it a flash and got to work.  Here&#39;s the thing about a keyboard like this, it only takes a few minutes to modify and reflash a layout! Naturally as I found issues and moved stuff about the layout became more personal. Thumbkeys + Layers really change the manner in which a keyboard can be used allowing holding of a thumbkey to entirely change the keys that will be send (and that&#39;s only the tip of the iceberg).  But the ErgoDox suffers on massive flaw, the thumb cluster is horrible for the outer thumb keys, half the buttons on the cluster are unusable/reachable and it&#39;s got this giant top. Hell, once you get into layering there&#39;s   way too many keys. Looking for a project this little guy happened.     Awesome, A smaller ErgoDox-like with a little trackball! Trimmed off the number row and useless outer keys, brought mouse controls to the front and went with a SMD focused design allowing the ErgoDoxes forehead to be removed and adding support for Kailh Chocs. Finally my bag had some space for non keyboard gear. The choice to go caseless was made for ergonomic reasons, if you look at MX Switch + ErgoDox you&#39;ll notice that you need a wrist rest to use it properly. Opting to remove tenting and moving to Low profile chocs was a compromise between ergonomics and durability. Currently it is hard to manufacture sculpted boards that are durable (Ask anyone with a Dactyl Manuform!). As before the layouts got smaller and more optimized for  Programming/Vim/i3/Shelling about.   Intermission:  I ended up making a few different designs while using a Gergo daily, namely the Georgi (stenography writer), ButterStick (20% ortholinear), Ginni (10% Split Ergo) and BuzzSaw (60% keyboard that transforms to a proper ergo with a bunch of snapoff parts). A few of these heavily rely on a custom chording engine that lives on top of QMK, needless to say between writing that engine and trying to learn stenography I learned a bunch about the wonders of chording and how you can really push the notion of  what a keyboard is\u00a0with it.  Chording, for those that don&#39;t know is a fancy word for pressing multiple keys to send an action, similar to combos that we know and love. An example of a chord would be IU -&gt; Esc, when I + U are depressed the escape code is sent by the keyboard. Due to the sheer number of combinations available on even a tiny board layouts are  highly personalized. A stenographer will have a custom dictionary that is full of their own briefs/snippets that&#39;s been crafted over the years and personal. And that&#39;s in addition to the entire English language fitting onto 30 keys :)  There is a issue with chording, spring force. With chording you&#39;ll sometime push two vertical keys with the same finger (applying force along the edges). A typical key has about 60-70gf of resistance, so a vertical chord is 120-140, and a edge chord (4 keys pushed by one finger such as TSDZ on a steno board) is 240-280! Needless to say that isn&#39;t very ergonomic, comfortable or fun. The solution is  very light switches. 35gf are the lightest commercial switches you can get (Gateron Clear/Kailh Choc Red Pro), but I take it even further.  12gf springs custom from Korea for Kailh Chocs. Very light typing, and only 24gf/48gf of force required in the very worst scenarios. The downside is that every other board I touch feels extremely hard.    End Intermission  Sadly, while functional those boards are just a bit too much for me. I took the lessons on chording and ran with it, including &#34;User-Hostile Design Principles&#34;, there&#39;s a bit of a write up over  here. In the interest of ergonomics the outer mod column, inner extras and outer thumb 2us were also ripped off. The idea being that you can&#39;t hurt yourself on what isn&#39;t there. To compensate dotted around the keyboard are a handful of small two-key chords powered by QMKs Combo feature. These are the game-changer for typing/vim/programming. Look at this layout, but most importantly the two finger chords. Think about how this would impact your typical workflow. If you&#39;ve never seen one of these before it&#39;ll look a little dense.  Here&#39;s the layout for Gergo:        And this here is GergoPlex       A little complex eh? The symbol/Number layers are controlled by the two thumb keys where your hands naturally rest, Vim style arrow/mouse movement and all modifiers are easily withing reach. The main downside of overloading keys with modifiers is that conflicts arise (For example, Control-A. You   must\u00a0use the opposite control!) but the reduction in motion is worth it. When using this layout the fingers only ever travel 1u from homerow (with the exception of the inner thumb 1u).  The real fun comes with those chords, for many often used keys you never need to leave home row. Take a second and find the following combos and what keys would need to be pressed.

H. Ingalls Learning Research Group Xerox Palo Alto Research Center   BYTE Magazine, August 1981. (c) by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., NY. Copied from  http://users.ipa.net/~dwighth/smalltalk/byte_aug81/design_principles_behind_smalltalk.html Scanned in and converted to HTML (with recreated graphics) by Dwight Hughes.  The purpose of the Smalltalk project is to provide computer support for the creative spirit in everyone. Our work flows from a vision that includes a creative individual and the best computing hardware available. We have chosen to concentrate on two principle areas of research: a language of description (programming language) that serves as an interface between the models in the human mind and those in computing hardware, and a language of interaction (user interface) that matches the human communication system to that of the computer. Our work has followed a two- to four-year cycle that can be seen to parallel the scientific method:  Build an application program within the current system (make an observation)  Based on that experience, redesign the language (formulate a theory)  Build a new system based on the new design (make a prediction that can be tested)\nThe Smalltalk-80 system marks our fifth time through this cycle. In this article, I present some of the general principles we have observed in the course of our work. While the presentation frequently touches on Smalltalk &#34;motherhood&#34;, the principles themselves are more general and should prove useful in evaluating other systems and in guiding future work.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just to get warmed up, I&#39;ll start with a principle that is more social than technical and that is largely responsible for the particular bias of the Smalltalk project:  Personal Mastery:    If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual.\nThe point here is that the human potential manifests itself in individuals. To realize this potential, we must provide a medium that can be mastered by a single individual. Any barrier that exists between the user and some part of the system will eventually be a barrier to creative expression. Any part of the system that cannot be changed or that is not sufficiently general is a likely source of impediment. If one part of the system works differently from all the rest, that part will require additional effort to control. Such an added burden may detract from the final result and will inhibit future endeavors in that area. We can thus infer a general principle of design:  Good Design:    A system should be built with a minimum set of unchangeable parts; those parts should be as general as possible; and all parts of the system should be held in a uniform framework.\n  Language  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In designing a language for use with computers, we do not have to look far to find helpful hints. Everything we know about how people think and communicate is applicable. The mechanisms of human thought and communication have been engineered for millions of years, and we should respect them as being of sound design. Moreover, since we must work with this design for the next million years, it will save time if we make our computer models compatible with the mind, rather that the other way around.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Figure 1 illustrates the principle components in our discussion. A person is presented as having a body and a mind. The body is the site of primary experience, and, in the context of this discussion, it is the physical channel through which the universe is perceived and through which intentions are carried out. Experience is recorded and processed in the mind. Creative thought (without going into its mechanism) can be viewed as the spontaneous appearance of information in the mind. Language is the key to that information:  The interaction between two individuals is represented in  figure 1 as two arcs. The solid arc represents explicit communication: the actual words and movements uttered and perceived. The dashed arc represents implicit communication: the shared culture and experience that form the context of the explicit communication. In human interaction, much of the actual communication is achieved through reference to shared context, and human language is built around such allusion. This is the case with computers as well.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is no coincidence that a computer can be viewed as one of the participants in  figure 1. In this case, the &#34;body&#34; provides for visual display of information and for sensing input from a human user. The &#34;mind&#34; of a computer includes the internal memory and processing elements and their contents.  Figure 1 shows that several different issues are involved in the design of a computer language:  Scope:    The design of a language for using computers must deal with internal models, external media, and the interaction between these in both the human and the computer.\nThis fact is responsible for the difficulty of explaining Smalltalk to people who view computer languages in a more restricted sense. Smalltalk is not simply a better way of organizing procedures or a different technique for storage management. It is not just an extensible hierarchy of data types, or a graphical user interface. It is all of these things and anything else that is needed to support the interactions shown in  figure 1.   \u00a0   Figure 1:    The scope of language design. Communication between two people (or between one person and a computer) includes communication on two levels. Explicit communication includes the information that is transmitted in a given message. Implicit communication includes the relevant assumptions common to the two beings.\n Communicating Objects  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The mind observes a vast universe of experience, both immediate and recorded. One can derive a sense of oneness with the universe simply by letting this experience be, just as it is. However, if one wishes to participate, literally to  take a part, in the universe, one must draw distinctions. In so doing one identifies an object in the universe, and simultaneously all the rest becomes not-that-object. Distinction by itself is a start, but the process of distinguishing does not get any easier. Every time you want to talk about &#34;that chair over there&#34;, you must repeat the entire processes of distinguishing that chair. This is where the act of reference comes in: we can associate a unique identifier with an object, and, from that time on, only the mention of that identifier is necessary to refer to the original object.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have said that a computer system should provide models that are compatible with those in the mind. Therefore:\n Objects:  A computer language should support the concept of &#34;object&#34; and provide a uniform means for referring to the objects in its universe.\nThe Smalltalk storage manager provides an object-oriented model of memory for the entire system. Uniform reference is achieved simply by associating a unique integer with every object in the system. This uniformity is important because it means that variables in the system can take on widely differing values and yet can be implemented as simple memory cells. Objects are created when expressions are evaluated, and they can be passed around by uniform reference, so that no provision for their storage is necessary in the procedures that manipulate them. When all references to an object have disappeared from the system, the object itself vanishes, and its storage is reclaimed. Such behavior is essential to full support of the object metaphor:  A way to find out if a language is working well is to see if programs look like they are doing what they are doing. If they are sprinkled with statements that relate to the management of storage, then their internal model is not well matched to that of humans. Can you imagine having to prepare someone for each thing you tell them or having to inform them when you are through with a given topic and that it can be forgotten?  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each object in our universe has a life of its own. Similarly, the brain provides for independent processing along with storage of each mental object. This suggests a third principle of design:  Messages:   Computing should be viewed as an intrinsic capability of objects that can be uniformly invoked by sending messages.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just as programs get messy if object storage is dealt with explicitly, control in the system becomes complicated if processing is performed extrinsically. Let us consider the process of adding 5 to a number. In most computer systems, the compiler figures out what kind of number it is and generates code to add 5 to it. This is not good enough for an object-oriented system because the exact kind of number cannot be determined by the compiler (more on this later). A possible solution is to call a general addition routine that examines the type of the arguments to determine the approximate action. This is not a good approach because it means that this  critical routine must be edited by novices who just want to experiment with their own class of numbers. It is also a poor design because intimate knowledge about the internals of objects is sprinkled throughout the system.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Smalltalk provides a much cleaner solution: it sends the  name of the desired operation, along with any arguments, as a  message to the number, with the understanding that the receiver knows best how to carry out the desired operation. Instead of a bit-grinding processor raping and plundering data structures, we have a universe of well-behaved objects that courteously ask each other to carry out their various desires. The transmission of messages is the only process that is carried on outside of objects and this is as it should be, since messages travel between objects. The principle of good design can be restated for languages:  Uniform Metaphor:  A language should be designed around a powerful metaphor that can be uniformly applied in all areas.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Examples of success in this area include LISP, which is built on the model of linked structures; APL, which is built on the model of arrays; and Smalltalk, which is built on the model of communicating objects. In each case, large applications are viewed in the same way as the fundamental units from which the system is built. In Smalltalk especially, the interaction between the most primitive objects is viewed in the same way as the highest-level interaction between the computer and its user. Every object in Smalltalk, even a lowly integer, has a set of messages, a  protocol, that defines the explicit communication to which that object can respond. Internally, objects may have local storage and access to other shared information which comprise the implicit context of all communication. For instance, the message + 5 (add five) carries an implicit assumption that the augend is the present value of the number receiving the message.  Organization  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A uniform metaphor provides a framework in which complex systems can be built. Several related organizational principles contribute to the successful management of complexity. To begin with:\n Modularity:  No component in a complex system should depend on the internal details of any other component.    \u00a0   Figure 2:  System complexity. As the number of components in a system increases, the chances for unwanted interaction increase rapidly. Because of this, a computer language should be designed to minimize the possibilities of such interdependence.\n This principle is depicted in  figure 2. If there are  N components in a system, then there are roughly  N-squared potential dependencies between them. If computer systems are ever to be of assistance in complex human tasks, they must be designed to minimize such interdependence. The message-sending metaphor provides modularity by decoupling the  intent of a message (embodied in its name) from the  method used by the recipient to carry out the intent. Structural information is similarly protected because all access to the internal state of an object is through this same message interface.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The complexity of a system can often be reduced by grouping similar components. Such grouping is achieved through data typing in conventional programming languages, and through  classes in Smalltalk. A class describes other objects -- their internal state, the message protocol they recognize, and the internal methods for responding to those messages. The objects so described are called  instances of that class. Even classes themselves fit into this framework; they are just instances of class  Class, which describes the appropriate protocol and implementation for object description.  Classification:  A language must provide a means for classifying similar objects, and for adding new classes of objects on equal footing with the kernel classes of the system.\n Classification is the objectification of  nessness. In other words, when a human sees a chair, the experience is taken both literally an &#34;that very thing&#34; and abstractly as &#34;that chair-like thing&#34;. Such abstraction results from the marvelous ability of the mind to merge &#34;similar&#34; experience, and this abstraction manifests itself as another object in the mind, the Platonic chair or chair ness.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Classes are the chief mechanism for extension in Smalltalk. For instance, a music system would be created by adding new classes that describe the representation and interaction protocol of  Note,  Melody,  Score,  Timbre,  Player, and so on. The &#34;equal footing&#34; clause of the above principle is important because it insures that the system will be used as it was designed. In other words, a melody could be represented as an ad hoc collection of  Integers representing pitch, duration, and other parameters, but if the language can handle  Notes as easily as  Integers, then the user will naturally describe a melody as a collection of  Notes. At each stage of design, a human will naturally choose the most effective representation if the system provides for it. The principle of modularity has an interesting implication for the procedural components in a system:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A conventional statement of this principle is that a program should never declare that a given object is a  SmallInteger or a  LargeInteger, but only that it responds to integer protocol. Such generic description is crucial to models of the real world.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consider an automobile traffic simulation. Many procedures in such a system will refer to the various vehicles involved. Suppose one wished to add, say, a street sweeper. Substantial amounts of computation (in the form of recompiling) and possible errors would be involved in making this simple extension if the code depended on the objects it manipulates. The message interface establishes an ideal framework for such an extension. Provided that street sweepers support the same protocol as all other vehicles, no changes are needed to include them in the simulation:  There are many reasons for this principle. First of all, it saves time, effort, and space if additions to the system need only be made in one place. Second, users can more easily locate a component that satisfies a given need. Third, in the absence of proper factoring, problems arise in synchronizing changes and ensuring that all interdependent components are consistent. You can see that a failure in factoring amounts to a violation of modularity.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Smalltalk encourages well-factored designs through  inheritance. Every class inherits behavior from its superclass. This inheritance extends through increasingly general classes, ultimately ending with class  Object which describes the default behavior of all objects in the system. In our traffic simulation above,  StreetSweeper (and all other vehicle classes) would be described as a subclass of a general  Vehicle class, thus inheriting appropriate default behavior and avoiding repetition of the same concepts in many different places. Inheritance illustrates a further pragmatic benefit of factoring:  Leverage:  When a system is well factored, great leverage is available to users and implementers alike.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Take the case of sorting an ordered collection of objects. In Smalltalk, the user would define a message called  sort in the class  OrderedCollection. When this has been done, all forms of ordered collections in the system will instantly acquire this new capability through inheritance. As an aside, it is worth noting that the same method can alphabetize text as well as sort numbers, since comparison protocol is recognized by the classes which support both text and numbers.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The benefits of structure for implementers are obvious. To begin with, there will be fewer primitives to implement. For instance, all graphics in Smalltalk are performed with a single primitive operation. With only one task to do, an implementer can bestow loving attention on every instruction, knowing that each small improvement in efficiency will be amplified throughout the system. It is natural to ask what set of primitive operations would be sufficient to support an entire computing system. The answer to this question is called a  virtual machine specification:  The Smalltalk virtual machine establishes an object-oriented model for storage, a message-oriented model for processing, and a bitmap model for visual display of information. Through the use of microcode, and ultimately hardware, system performance can be improved dramatically without any compromise to the other virtues of the system.  User Interface  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A user interface is simply a language in which most of the communication is visual. Because visual presentation overlaps heavily with established human culture, esthetics plays a very important role in this area. Since all capability of a computer system is ultimately delivered through the user interface, flexibility is also essential here. An enabling condition for adequate flexibility of a user interface can be stated as an object-oriented principle:  Reactive Principle:  Every component accessible to the user should be able to present itself in a meaningful way for observation and manipulation.\nThis criterion is well supported by the model of communicating objects. By definition, each object provides an appropriate message protocol for interaction. This protocol is essentially a microlanguage particular to just that kind of object. At the level of the user interface, the appropriate language for each object on the screen is presented visually (as text, menus, pictures) and sensed through keyboard activity and the use of a pointing device.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It should be noted that operating systems seem to violate this principle. Here the programmer has to depart from an otherwise consistent framework of description, leave whatever context has been built up, and deal with an entirely different and usually very primitive environment. This need not be so:  Operating System:  An operating system is a collection of things that don&#39;t fit into a language. There shouldn&#39;t be one.\nHere are some examples of conventional operating system components that have been naturally incorporated into the Smalltalk language:  Storage management -- Entirely automatic. Objects are created by a message to their class and reclaimed when no further references to them exist. Expansion of the address space through virtual memory is similarly transparent.  File system -- Included in the normal framework through objects such as  Files and  Directories with message protocols that support file access.  Display handling -- The display is simply an instance of class  Form, which is continually visible, and the graphical manipulation messages defined in that class are used to change the visible image.  Keyboard Input -- The user input devices are similarly modeled as objects with appropriate messages for determining their state or reading their history as a sequence of events.  Access to subsystems -- Subsystems are naturall\n......", "posttime": "2020-06-13 19:05:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

\u201cYou and your team of archaeologists have fallen into the \u2018catacombs of the zombies\u2019.\u201d A miserable situation, to be sure. But this was the chilling trial that faced players of Entombed, an Atari 2600 game, according to  the instruction manual.\n The catacombs were an unforgiving place. A downward-scrolling, two-dimensional maze that players had to navigate expertly in order to evade the \u201cclammy, deadly grip\u201d of their zombie foes. An archaeologist\u2019s nightmare.\n Released in 1982, Entombed was far from a best-seller and today it\u2019s largely forgotten. But recently, a computer scientist and a digital archaeologist decided to pull apart the game\u2019s source code to investigate how it was made.\n   There was always something intriguing about Entombed, recalls John Aycock at the University of Calgary, in Alberta, Canada. And because it had fallen into obscurity, it hadn\u2019t been pulled apart and analysed in depth before \u2013 one the main reasons Aycock and his co-author Tara Copplestone at the University of York, UK,  were drawn to Entombed as a subject to study over the other 500 games made for the Atari 2600 console.\n The pair are among a growing number of \u201cvideo game archaeologists\u201d who are unearthing long forgotten pieces of software and pulling them apart. Inside they are finding clues to how the early days of video gaming came about, but also secrets that can help modern programmers with some of the problems they are facing today.\n  Like intrepid explorers of catacombs, Aycock and Copplestone sought curious relics inside Entombed. But they got more than they bargained for: they found a mystery bit of code they couldn\u2019t explain. It seems the logic behind it has been lost forever.\n  Maze-navigating games were very common back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but the method used to generate a maze varied, depending on the programmer. In the age of Atari, games had to be designed with incredible skill because the computer systems that ran them were so limited. (  Read more about the mind of a maze-builder.)\n Although the blocky, two dimensional mazes from entombed might look simple by the standards of today\u2019s computer graphics, in 1982 you couldn\u2019t just design a set of mazes, store them in the game and later display them on-screen \u2013 there wasn\u2019t enough memory on the game cartridges for something like that. In many cases, mazes were generated \u201cprocedurally\u201d \u2013 in other words, the game created them randomly on the fly, so players never actually traversed the same maze twice.\n But how do you do get a computer program to avoid churning out a useless maze with too many walls, or an otherwise impenetrable floorplan?\n  Aycock understood the trickiness of the problem. He thought there was a good chance he\u2019d find some clever process at work in the depths of Entombed.\n \u201cIt was a very deep rabbit hole,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAs I dug into this maze algorithm, it became clear that this was something that seemed to be fairly unique to this maze game.\u201d\n It turned out that the maze is generated in a sequence. The game needs to decide, as it draws each new square of the maze, whether it should draw a wall or a space for the game characters to move around in. Each square should therefore be \u201cwall\u201d or \u201cno wall\u201d \u2013 \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d in computer bits. The game\u2019s algorithm decides this automatically by analysing a section of the maze. It uses a five-square tile that looks a little like a Tetris piece. This tile determines the nature of the next square in each row.\n How? That\u2019s the fascinating part. The fundamental logic that determines the next square is locked in a table of possible values written into the game\u2019s code. Depending on the values of the five-square tile, the table tells the game to deposit either wall, no wall or a random choice between the two.\n  It seems straightforward, but the thing is, no-one can work out how the table was made.\n Aycock and Copplestone have tried retro-engineering the table. They looked for patterns in the values to try and reveal how it was designed, but this was to no avail. Whatever the programmer did, it was a stroke of mild genius. Every time the game is played, a reliably navigable maze is pumped out. Were the table\u2019s values random or even slightly different, the maze would likely fail to be drawn with a playable path through it. It just seems impossible to explain. (  Read about how maths can help you solve mazes.)\n  \u201cThe abnormality of the table was just quite striking,\u201d says Copplestone. She says this is an example of a classic conundrum in archaeology. \u201cI think there\u2019s this assumption that when we find things, we know what they are \u2013 if we pull a spearhead out of the ground, we know what it is,\u201d she says. \u201c[But] more often than not, we have no idea what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n  \u201cThe struggle I have as a scientist is, I think that there should be some logical way that this will all make sense and there really doesn\u2019t seem to be.\u201d\n The best guess the pair have is that the programmer behind the maze algorithm must have manually fine-tuned the table values until the game worked as desired, but that still doesn\u2019t really explain the logic behind it.\n  During their research, Aycock and Copplestone were able to interview one of the people involved in the game\u2019s production, Steve Sidley.\n He too remembered being confused by the table at the time. \u201cI couldn\u2019t unscramble it,\u201d he told the researchers. And he claimed it had been the work of a programmer who developed it while not entirely sober: \u201cHe told me it came upon him when he was drunk and whacked out of his brain.\u201d Aycock tried to contact the programmer in question but got no response.\n Maybe no-one ever really understood the logic of the algorithm. But there it is, in a 1982 Atari game, posing a seemingly unanswerable question.\n  Andrew Reinhard, also at the University of York, writes about and practices video game archaeology. He says Aycock and Copplestone\u2019s work on Entombed is another hint that there are many gems just waiting to be found in old games and old software, generally.\n \u201cI have a feeling that what has happened in Entombed has happened more frequently than not, it\u2019s just we haven\u2019t learned what games have this stuff,\u201d he says.\n The idea that archaeologists would be intrigued by video games from just a few decades ago may sound strange to some. We\u2019re rather more used to seeing avid excavators dust off beautiful vases buried in mud for millennia, or similar treasures. But Reinhard points out that video games have become a major commercial enterprise and an important part of our culture. Game artefacts store up their own record of human history.\n Digital archaeologists can dig for clues about the evolution of programming, unravel the workings of old technology and gain insights to the fading culture of the 20th Century \u2013 by excavating video games. Another programmer, Alexei Pepers, at Improbable Canada, even refers to retro games as archaeology \u201csites\u201d.\n  She says it was heartening to hear that some early 1980s programmer may have inexplicably tweaked their code just to get Entombed running \u2013 that sort of trial-and-error fiddling is a well-known process in programming. \u201cI found that so relatable, certainly in my own work,\u201d says Pepers.\n And uncovering the methods by which early game programmers overcame the technical constraints of the systems they worked with is not just academically interesting. It has relevance today.\n Take the programming of virtual reality games and experiences, for example. You couldn\u2019t imagine something more visually different from a two-dimensional Atari maze game. But the demands on the programmer are similar in nature.\n \u201cYou\u2019re very constrained technically because [a VR game] has to run at very high frame rates,\u201d explains Pepers. \u201cAnd you\u2019re constrained in how the player can move and what they can do.\u201d\n By researching tricks and work-arounds from a former era, perhaps 21st Century programmers, pushing today\u2019s technology to its limits, might learn something genuinely useful.\n With Entombed, Aycock believes the maze algorithm they uncovered is a good example of how creative game programmers can get.\n \u201cFrom a modern perspective, I think it&#39;s also an interesting case study looking at how to solve a problem in extremely constrained time and (memory) space,&#34; he adds.\n  It is not just code that digital archaeologists comb through. In 1983, Atari buried 700,000 cartridges of video games at a landfill site in Alamogordo, New Mexico. It was a historic event in video game history \u2013 widely rumoured and discredited by some as an urban myth.\n The titles the firm chose to bury had been widely panned and were proving impossible to sell. One, ET the Extra-Terrestrial, has been lampooned as  the worst video game ever.\n For more than three decades, the cartridges lay there, degrading. But in 2014, Andrew Reinhard and colleagues went on a dig at the site. The burial was not, in fact, an urban myth \u2013 Reinhard dug up 1,300 cartridges. Hundreds of the ET games  were sold on Ebay, for a total of about $108,000 (\u00a383,500).\n  While none of the games initially seemed to be playable, one gamer bought a copy of Asteroids and,  by cleaning up and reconnecting some of the electronics, was able to get it working again.\n It may only have taken a few more decades in the New Mexico dust to make the cartridge completely unsalvageable. There\u2019s a challenge, then, awaiting archaeologists who treat electronics as artefacts in the near future: time may be rapidly running out.\n Video game archaeology is possibly quite urgent, in fact, because the actual physical form of mass-produced games is ephemeral. And the logic and know-how that went into programming those games can so easily be lost. That\u2019s partly why computer archiving projects  seek to store the digital form of old games, in an effort to preserve them long term.\n But the preservation of video games is only the first step. The mystery maze table in Entombed reminds us that, even with a good record, fully understanding a game is another thing entirely. Maybe we\u2019ll never quite grasp it. Entombed presents us \u2013 somewhat ironically \u2013 with a dead-end.\n The instruction manual, to be fair, did warn us. \u201cBefore you know it,\u201d it read, \u201cyou\u2019ll be entombed!\u201d\n  Join one million Future fans by liking us on\u00a0   Facebook , or follow us on\u00a0   Twitter \u00a0or\u00a0   Instagram .\n If you liked this story,\u00a0   sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter , called \u201cThe Essential List\u201d.

"note_en": "This post is the first public announcement of my new package manager anddeployment tool for linux -  hermes.\n   Those familiar with Nix or Guix will feel right at home, oryou could think of hermes a bit like docker, where instead of building images in layers,you are building software packages from source into directories thatcan reference each other.\n  The following are some simple and non comprehensive examples, designed to show what using hermes looks like\u2026\n              Hermes is an attempt at creating a simple but powerful package managementtool where you maintain total control of your software dependencies.\n You could also consider Hermes my attempt at simplifying some of the ideas andimplementation behind  Nix and  Guix.These simplifications range from less code, fewer commands, no C++, no monads,no lazy functional programming, no glibc. Don\u2019t worry if those don\u2019t mean muchto you, the point is you shouldn\u2019t really need to know about them.\n       I\u2019ve tried to simplify the model of packagingthat Nixos and Guix have pioneered.\n Hermes packages definitions are just functions, that when called, build softwareby running commands like  ./configure and  make. If the packageis already installed, hermes doesn\u2019t bother building it again.\n The main difference from \u2018traditional\u2019 package managers, is each packagehas a unique install directory, so there doesn\u2019t need to be any package conflict handling.\n  Hermes itself is lean, it fits on a floppy disk when statically linked andcompressed, and can be made even smaller when omitting certain features.\n Hermes only has a few core commands, hermes build,  hermes cp, and  hermes gc, which so far are enough to build packages,do remote deployments and remove unwanted packages.\n   I am not a fan of the docker daemon, or the nix and guix build daemons. Hermes does not useone, instead working via other mechanisms such as lock files and strategic setuid.\n  Packages are written in the  Janet programming language witha small set of extra functions that make sense in the context of building software.\n When you create a hermes package you write a small function for installingthe package into the path pointed to by the dynamically scoped variable :pkg-out.All dependencies are automatically detected and built simply by referencing them.\n  (use ../prelude)(import ../core)(defsrc ed-src :url &#34;http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/ed/ed-1.16.tar.lz&#34; :hash &#34;sha256:cfc07a14ab048a758473ce222e784fbf031485bcd54a76f74acfee1f390d8b2c&#34;)(defpkg ed :builder (fn [] (core/link-/bin/sh) (os/setenv &#34;PATH&#34; (join-pkg-paths &#34;:&#34; &#34;/bin&#34; [core/coreutils core/sed core/grep core/awk core/gcc core/make])) (os/setenv &#34;CFLAGS&#34; *default-cflags*) (os/setenv &#34;LDFLAGS&#34; *default-ldflags*) (unpack-src ed-src) (sh/$ ./configure --prefix= ^ (dyn :pkg-out)) (sh/$ make -j (dyn :parallelism)) (sh/$ make install)))\n You should note that Janet itself is a small but powerfulgeneral purpose programming language, so the skills you learn usinghermes are useful for writing all sorts of great software.\n    If you are an experienced Nix or Guix user, feel free to give hermes a try, otherusers may wish to hold off until more ground work is in place.", "posttime": "2020-06-13 17:57:43", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5e0c\u814a\u795e\u8bdd,hermes", "title": "&lt;\u5e0c\u814a\u795e\u8bdd&gt;\u8d6b\u8033\u58a8\u65af", "title_en": "Hermes", "transed": 1, "url": "https://acha.ninja/blog/introducing_hermes/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5e0c\u814a\u795e\u8bdd", "hermes"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "373df4525cdb41f314d57445b20f452b.jpg", "infoid": 1006396, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u56de\u5230\u6211\u7684\u8d26\u6237&amp\uff1b\u9690\u79c1\u6211\u4eec\u5f88\u9057\u61be\u770b\u5230\u4f60\u79bb\u5f00\uff01\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8981\u5220\u9664\u60a8\u7684\u5e10\u6237\uff0c\u8bf7\u6267\u884c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\n\u5728\u6587\u672c\u9891\u9053\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u60a8\u8981\u5220\u9664\u60a8\u7684\u5e10\u6237\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u60a8\u7684Rainway\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u540d\u3002", "note_en": "Back to My Account &amp; Privacy We\u2019ll be sorry to see you go!
