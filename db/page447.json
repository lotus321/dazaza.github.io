This is an important victory that recognises the registry&#39;s long legacy as a mission-based, not-for-profit entity protecting the interests of thousands of organisations and the people they serve,&#34; it said in a statement.\n &#34;But the .org registry still needs a faithful steward, because the Internet Society has made clear it no longer wants that responsibility.&#34;\n PIR is incorporated in Pennsylvania, where the state&#39;s attorney general is also investigating the sale.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 21:16:37", "tags": "\u57df\u540d,\u7f51\u7ad9,web,\u6ce8\u518c,profit",

"note_en": "Anyone can publish on Medium per our  Policies, but we don\u2019t fact-check every story. For more info about the coronavirus, see  cdc.gov.\n  COVID 19 is about to kill restaurants by the thousands. This pandemic is the ultimate pressure test and restaurants are failing hard. Think about it: when we come out of this, your favourite food spots might not be there any more. Why are they so fucked? Let me explain.\n Margins in the restaurant industry are notoriously small. Like tiny, actually. For reference, margins for banking, accounting, and legal services come in around 18\u201325%, healthcare 12-15%, and software 15\u201325%. Restaurants? 3\u20139%.  Ya, like single digit. These razor thin profit margins have left restaurants with zero reserves. So when a crisis hits ( like right now), they are pretty much screwed. Restaurant owners \u2019only options are to swallow their pride, beg, and hope for help \u2014or throw in the proverbial  ...\n So, why are the margins so bad anyway? Well, it starts with the fact that the industry as a whole shot itself in the foot when it started competing on price. See, it wasn\u2019t always this way \u2014 margins used to be double, if not triple, what they are now. But for the past couple decades, while menu prices should have been rising to keep up with things like inflation and rapidly increasing rent, price wars instead drove them down ( $1 value meal anyone?). All this eroded margins til restaurants were  ...\n \u201cEven widely lauded restaurateurs are taking ever-smaller earnings. The 15-20% margins of 20 years ago have dwindled to a mere 4-7% today.\u201d \u2014  Philly Mag\n That brings me to my next point: our lack of understanding or appreciation of the true cost of running a food operation.  We just don\u2019t know.And our assumptions are way off. To be honest, I didn \u2019t know most of this either before I opened Wolf Down (quick serve German Street Food). And let me tell you, it was quite the eye opener! I \u2019ll share what I discovered through my experience to shed light on why restaurants are so fucked, why we are (at least in part) accountable, and how we have the power  ...\n  First we need to understand how restaurant margins work. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep it simple. Profit margin is what\u2019s left of sales revenue after subtracting all expenses to get food into your belly. This includes food cost (COGS), labour cost, and overhead. It seems pretty straight forward at first, but there are a lot of  hidden costs that might surprise you. I\u2019ll share just a few that I\u2019d never even thought about before Wolf Down.\n Food cost obviously includes all the ingredients.  What we often forget though are things like waste and packaging cost, which can add up fast. Our take-out bowls, for example, cost $0.35 each. Add a fork, bag and napkins and that \u2019s a nice little bite out of our profit margin. I was also somehow convinced that getting product from big food suppliers would be cheaper since we buy in bulk. Apparently that \u2019s not always the case. For some things yes, but for others, they up-charge. Drinks for  ...\n In terms of overhead costs, there \u2019s the obvious stuff like rent, utilities, insurance, internet, bookkeeping, payment processing, etc. Then there \u2019s all this other stuff I \u2019d never thought about \u2014like $300/month for waste management (we \u2019re so used to free garbage pick-up at home that I never anticipated having to pay for it). Then there \u2019s $150 for linen service to wash all the cleaning towels, another $150 for dishwasher rental, another $150 for grease trap servicing, and don \u2019t forget  ...\n All-in, food cost generally eats up around 33% of revenue, labour chews up another 33%, and hopefully overhead is low enough to have leftovers. Ratios vary based by restaurant type, but profit margins usually land around 3\u20139%. To help illustrate this, I put together a rough breakdown of costs for a d\u00f6ner at Wolf Down to give you an idea of how it all breaks down.\n  In our case, food cost is higher than recommended due to our bread and proteins. We wanted the best, freshest sourdough for our d\u00f6ner bread, so we partnered with Artisin who bakes it custom for us. This is much pricier than pre-packaged pitas but, based on the raving reviews, totally worth it. As for the protein, not only do we use high quality stuff, but contrary to many spots these days, we don \u2019t skimp on protein. Most places average 75 \u2013100g per portion. We go over 125g. Cause that  ...\n Since we refuse to sacrifice proper portions and product quality, I knew we had to find other ways to keep costs down. We designed our streamlined menu precisely for this \u2014optimizing operating costs to compensate for food cost. Still, as you can see, after wolfing down, there isn \u2019t much left. Roughly a dollar or so. That means we need to sell a whole lot of d\u00f6ner to make a little profit. All I \u2019m trying to say is, no one is making millions here, just trying to save up a little something  ...\n Ok so, how can we lower costs? Other than expanding to take benefit from economies of scale (ie. why big chains are doing ok), the options, well, you\u2019re not gonna like them\u2026\n Option 1: Lower food cost. Lower quality ingredients cost less.  But wait, they also won\u2019t be as fresh or tasty.  You cool with that? Restaurants already do all they can to negotiate with suppliers to lower cost \u2014 and when they go too far, it shows. Personally, it makes me want to cry when my favourite sandwich spot replaces its fresh crusty sourdough for bagged pre-sliced Wonder trash.  But I get it. Though in my head I\u2019m yelling \u2018 I\u2019ll pay for the good shit \u2014please, bring it back!\u2019. So  ...\n Option 2: Cut overhead costs. Again, restaurants do their best to negotiate with landlords, insurance companies, utilities, internet providers\u2026 and we all know how well that tends to work. If you want a nice clean dining experience \u2014 it is what is, and it costs what it costs. Not much wiggle room here.\n Option 3: Reduce labour cost.  How long do you want to wait for food? Is it ok if it\u2019s not cooked perfectly cause one guy is trying to do five things at once? Besides, it\u2019s not like we can we pay them any less \u2014 most make minimum wage. If anything, we don\u2019t pay them enough. If you think they are  \u2018non-skilled workers\u2019 \u2014 are you saying feeding you is not a valuable skill? I\u2019ve worked with great people in tech and finance, but they\u2019re no better or harder working than our  Wolf Pack. This  ...\n \u201cIn most people\u2019s opinion, an office job is preferable to a career in the restaurant industry. Which is not to say it\u2019s not worthy work. If this pandemic has proven anything, it\u2019s how essential those working in the food industry are. Instead, these assumptions come from a cycle of low pay and bad benefits that devalue both the job itself and the people doing it.\u201d \u2014  Eater\n And in case anyone is wondering \u201c Then how come Wolf Down can afford to feed healthcare workers for free?\u201d What\u2019s the deal?  Fine. For the sake of this post, I\u2019ll come clean: it comes from our (the owner\u2019s) pockets, not Wolf Down\u2019s.\n What about third-party delivery? Do they help or hurt restaurants? That\u2019s a whole other conversation I dive into in my post \u2018 Why Uber Eats is A Necessary Evil\u2019 \u2014 check it out if interested in learning more about that.\n How about tips? Tips are hugely appreciated and really help staff survive, which is awesome. Unfortunately, however, tips do not impact margins. Even though tipping generously is always commendable \u2014  please keep it up!\u2014it does not solve the problem.  So what do we do?\n Desperate times call for desperate measures. Although we can\u2019t change the past, we can reshape the future. Let\u2019s learn something from COVID 19. Let\u2019s create positive change out of a bad situation and finally fix this mess. If you love food as much as I do, you might want to pay attention.\n Whenever the margin issue comes up, the answer always seems to be \u2018 just lower costs\u2019.  Like duh. But wait! We already trimmed all the fat\u2026 Decreasing costs won\u2019t solve this. That leaves only one option: increasing sales revenue. We\u2019ve been looking at it all wrong. The simple truth is we don\u2019t pay enough. Without realizing it, we\u2019ve been cheaping out on restaurants.\n The craziest thing to me in all this is, I love food. Like, obsessed.  Who\u2019s with me? My point is: if eating is literally one of our favourite things ever, are we willing to pay adequately for it? Do we value it sufficiently? Honestly, seems to me like, if there\u2019s one industry that should be profitable, it\u2019s restaurants. One, we have to eat. Two, we love to eat! What if you could never have your favourite pizza, burger, pasta, etc, again? What would you pay to save it?\n Reports show that, due to COVID 19, 1 in 10 restaurants is already gone for good. And this is just the beginning. When restaurants do re-open (those that survive), they will be in rough shape. This is when we need to step up to ensure that those who put food on our tables can keep food on theirs.\n Let\u2019s call it OPTION 19. As in,  we already tried all the other options and none work. As in,  fuck you COVID 19! It\u2019s very simple: let\u2019s reset our expectations and restore respectable margins. Like back in the 1990\u2019s. Like many other industries today. We can do better. They deserve better. Let\u2019s aim for 19%.\n How do  we do this? By supporting your favourite restaurants adjusting menu prices as needed.  That\u2019s it. For too long they\u2019ve avoided doing this out of fear we would rebel. Armed with new knowledge, let\u2019s be more understanding. That\u2019s how we #supportlocal. That\u2019s how we keep enjoying our favourite foods. It won\u2019t kill us. It will save them.\n  If you feel like it, please share, post, tag, like, publish, send to journalist, tell your friends \u2014 whatever you can to help this all be for something.", "posttime":

"note_en": "In one of the last interviews he gave before his death, shareware pioneer Jim Button said that he \u201chad written off the idea of shareware games\u201d prior to the beginning of the 1990s. At the time, it seemed a reasonable position to take, one based on quite a bit of evidence. While any number of people had tried to sell their games this way, there had been no shareware success stories in games to rival those of Andrew Fluegelman, Jim Button, or Bob Wallace.\n Naturally, many pondered why this should be so. The answers they came up with were often shot through with the prejudices of the period, which held that programming or playing frivolous games was a less upstanding endeavor than that of making or using stolid business software. Still, even the prejudiced answers often had a ring of truth. You had a long-term relationship with your telecommunications program, database, or word processor, such that sending its author a check in order to join the  ...\n Luckily, there was an alternative to the shareware model for those game programmers who lacked the right combination of connections, ambitions, and talents to go the traditional commercial route \u2014 an alternative that offered a better prospect than shareware during the 1980s of getting paid at least a little something for one\u2019s efforts. It was the odd little ghetto of the disk magazines, and so it\u2019s there that we must start our story today.\n   The core idea behind the disk magazines is almost as old as personal computing itself. In February of 1978, Ralph McElroy of Goleta, California, published the first issue of  CLOAD, a monthly collection of software for the  Radio Shack TRS-80, the first pre-assembled microcomputer to rack up really impressive sales numbers. \u201cTo join the somewhat elite club of computer users, \u201dwrote McElroy in his introductory editorial, \u201cone [previously] had to learn the mysterious art of speaking in a rather  ...\n By 1981, the TRS-80\u2019s early momentum was beginning to flag and the more capable  Apple II was coming on strong. Jim Mangham, a programmer at the Louisiana State University Medical Center in Shreveport, decided that the market was ready for a  CLOADequivalent for the Apple II \u2014albeit published not on cassettes but on floppy disks, which were now steadily gaining traction. He recruited a buddy named Al Vekovius to join him in the venture, and the two prepared the first issue of something they  ...\n Starting with just 50 subscribers, Mangham and Vekovius built  Softdiskinto a real force in Apple II computing. Well aware that they couldn \u2019t possibly write enough software themselves to fill a disk every single month, they worked hard from the beginning to foster a symbiotic relationship with their readership; most of the programs they published came from the readers themselves. In the early days, the spirit of reciprocity extended to the point of expecting readers to mail their disks back  ...\n Thus Mangham and Vekovius\u2019s little company Softdisk Publishing slowly turned into a veritable disk-magazine empire. In time, Mangham stepped back from day-to-day operations, becoming a nearly silent partner to Vekovius, always the more business-focused of the pair. He expanded  Softdisk to two disks per issue in August of 1983; started reaching retail stores by January of 1984; launched a companion disk magazine called  Loadstarfor the Commodore 64 in June of 1984. Softdisk survived the great  ...\n   In order to encourage software submissions, all of the Softdisk magazines ran a periodic programming competition called CodeQuest. Readers were encouraged to send in programs of any type, competing for prizes of $1000 for the top submission, $500 for second place, and $250 for third place, on top of the money Softdisk would pay upon eventually publishing the winning software.  Big Blue Disk\u2018s second incarnation of the contest ended on January 31, 1988, yielding two winners that were fairly  ...\n At the time of the contest, Miller didn \u2019t seem to be going much of anywhere in life. In his late twenties, he was still attending junior college in a rather desultory fashion whilst working dead-end gigs at the lower end of the data-processing totem pole, such as babysitting his college \u2019s computer lab. His acquaintances hardly expected him to ever move out of his parents \u2019house, much less change an industry. Yet this seeming slacker had reserves of ambition, persistence, marketing acumen,  ...\n  Before entering the CodeQuest contest, he\u2019d written a column on games for the local newspaper, written a book on how to beat popular arcade games, and, last but not least, tested the early shareware market for games: he\u2019d written and distributed  a couple of  shareware text adventuresunder the name of Apogee Software \u2014a name which would later become very, very famous among a certain segment of gamers. But on this occasion he was disappointed by the response, just like everyone else making  ...\n Put crudely,\u00a0 Kingdom of Kroz was a mash-up of the old mainframe classic   Rogue and the arcade game   Gauntlet \u2014 or, if you like, a version of  Rogue that  played in real time and had handcrafted levels instead of procedurally-generated ones. It wasn\u2019t much to look at \u2014 like classic  Rogue, it was rendered entirely in ASCII graphics \u2014 but many people found it surprisingly addictive once they got into it. It went over very well indeed with  Big Blue Disk\u2018s subscribers when it appeared in the  ...\n While he waited on  Big Blue Diskto release those sequels, Miller started to explore a new idea for marketing games outside the traditional publishing framework. In fact, this latest idea would eventually prove his greatest single stroke of marketing genius, even if its full importance would take some time yet to crystallize. He would later sum up his insight in an interview: \u201cPeople aren \u2019t willing to pay for something they \u2019ve already got in their hands, but they are willing to pay  ...\n Miller and George Broussard, his longtime best friend and occasional partner in the treacherous world of shareware, made an engine for multiple-choice trivia games \u2014 not exactly a daunting programming challenge after the likes of  Kroz. They compiled sets of questions dealing with different topics: general trivia,  vocabulary,  the original  Star Trek and  Star Trek: The Next Generation. They created \u201cvolumes \u201din each category consisting of 100 questions. Then they released the first  ...\n Alas, the scheme proved not to be a surefire means of selling trivia games; the economics of getting just 100 questions for $4 were perhaps a bit dodgy even in the late 1980s, when just about everything involving computers cost exponentially more than it does today. But a seed had been planted; the next time Miller tried something similar, he would finally hit pay dirt.\n The next time in question came in the second half of 1989, just after  Big Blue Disk published the last  Kroz game. The magazine\u2019s contract terms were far more generous than those of any traditional software publisher: Miller had retained the  Kroz copyright throughout, and the magazine\u2019s license to it became non-exclusive as soon as it published the third and last game of the trilogy. Miller, in other words, could now do whatever he wished with his three  Krozgames, while still benefiting  ...\n  So, he decided to try the same scheme he had used with his trivia games: release the first part of the trilogy for free, but ask people to send him $7.50 each for the second and third parts. A tactic that had prompted an underwhelming response the first time around worked out much better this time. Unlike those earlier exercises in multiple choice, the  Kroz trilogy was made up of real  games\u2014or, perhaps better said, was actually one real game artificially divided into three. After  ...\n In short, Scott Miller \u2014and shareware gaming in general \u2014finally got their equivalent to that day when Jim Button returned home from a Hawaiian vacation to find his basement drowning in paid registrations. Suddenly Miller as well was drowning in mail, making thousands of dollars every month. He \u2019d done it; his dogged persistence had paid off. He \u2019d found a way around the machinations of the big publishers, found a way to sell games on his own terms, cracked the code of shareware  ...\n From here, things happened very, very quickly. Miller whipped up a second trilogy of  Kroz games to sell under the same model \u2014  first part free,  second and  thirdmust be paid for \u2014and was rewarded with more checks in the mail. Most people at this point would have been content to continue writing lone-wolf games and reaping huge rewards \u2014but Miller was, as I \u2019ve already noted, a man of unusual ambition. At heart, he was more passionate about marketing games than programming them;  ...\n Already before 1989 was over, he had reached out to a Silicon Valley youth named Todd Raplogle, who had created and uploaded to various bulletin-board systems a little action-adventure called  Caves of Thor that was similar in spirit to the  Kroz games. Miller convinced Raplogle to re-release his free game under the Apogee imprint, and to make two paid sequels to accompany it. Raplogle followed that trilogy up with a tetralogy called   Monuments of Mars. Meanwhile George Broussard  ...\n By 1991, Apogee was off and running as a real business. Miller quit his dead-end day jobs, moved out of his parents\u2019 house, convinced Broussard to join him as a full-time partner, found an accountant, leased himself an office, and started hiring helpline attendants and clerical help to deal with a workload that was mushrooming for all the right reasons. His life had undergone a head-spinning transformation in the span of less than two years.\n At this point, then, we might want to ask ourselves in a more holistic way just  whyApogee became so successful so quickly. Undoubtedly, a huge part of the equation is indeed the much-vaunted \u201cApogee model \u201dof selling shareware: hook them with a free game, then reel them in with the paid sequels. Yet that wasn \u2019t a silver bullet in and of itself, as Miller \u2019s own early lack of success with his trivia games illustrates. It had to be executed just right \u2014which tells us that Miller  ...\n If all of this sounds a bit mercenary, so be it; Miller was as hard-nosed as capitalists come, and he certainly wasn \u2019t running Apogee as a charity. Yet it \u2019s seldom good business, at least in the long run, to sell junk, and this too Miller understood. Apogee maintained a level of quality control that was often lacking even from the big publishers, who often felt compelled to release a game before its time to meet the Christmas market or to pump up the quarterly numbers.  ...\n I \u2019ll be the first to admit that the Apogee style of game does little for me. Still, my personal tastes in no way blind me to the reality that these unprepossessing but well-crafted little games filled a space in the market of the early 1990s that the big publishers were missing entirely as they rushed to cement a grand merger of Silicon Valley and Hollywood and begin the era of the \u201cinteractive movie. \u201dWhile the boxed-games industry went more and more high-concept, with  ...\n But of course a business model as profitable as Miller \u2019s must soon attract rivals who hope to execute it even better. Already in 1992, a company called Epic MegaGames appeared to challenge Apogee for the title of King of Shareware; they as well employed Scott Miller \u2019s episodic approach, and also echoed Apogee \u2019s proven action-first design aesthetic. Shareware gaming was becoming a thriving shadow industry of its own, right under the noses of the big boys who were still  ...\n  This shareware sales chart from July of 1993 shows how dominant Apogee was at that time. Seven out of the top ten games are theirs, with a further two going to Epic MegaGames, their only remotely close competitor. Although the fast-and-simple design aesthetic in which those companies specialized ruled the charts, they pulled with them a long tale of many other types of shareware games, as we \u2019ll see in the next part of this article. The very fact that there existed a  ...\n Many of you doubtless have an inkling already of where this series of articles must go from here \u2014 of how not only the story of Apogee Software but also that of Softdisk Publications will feed directly into that of the most transformative computer game in history. And never fear, I\u2019ll get to all of that \u2014 but in my next article rather than this one.\n For in addition to that other story which threatens to suck all the oxygen out of the room, there are a thousand other, smaller ones of individual creators being inspired to program all kinds of games and sell them as shareware in the wake of Apogee \u2019s success. Exactly none of them made as much money from their endeavors as did Scott Miller, but some became popular enough to still be remembered today. Indeed, many of us who were around back then still have our obscure  ...\n Like the Apogee games, many other shareware titles identified holes in the market which the big publishers, who all seemed to be rushing hell-bent in the exact same direction, were failing to fill. In many cases, these were genres from which the traditional industry had actually done very well in the past, but which which it had now judged to no longer to be worth its while. For example, the years between the  collapse of Infocomin 1989 and the beginning of the Internet-based  ...\n In terms of presentation, most of these shareware games were dead ringers for the games that had been sold on store shelves five to ten years earlier. And by the same token, the people who made them in the 1990s were really not all that different from the bedroom programmers who had built the boxed-games industry in the 1980s. Just as many creators of non-game shareware were uncomfortable with time-limited or otherwise crippled software, not all creators of shareware  ...\n By way of illustration, I\u2019d like to conclude this article with a short case study of a shareware parnership that didn\u2019t make its principals rich, that didn\u2019t even allow them to quit their day jobs. In fact, neither partner ever really even  triedto achieve either of those things. They just made games in two unfashionable styles which they still happened to love, and said games made some other people with the same tastes very happy. And that was more than enough for  ...\n   Matthew remembers his best childhood Christmas ever as the one in 1983, when he was twelve years old and his family got an Apple IIe computer. A sheet of Apple-logo stickers came in the box that housed the computer, and Matthew stuck one of them on his notebook. Soon Daniel, another student at his Los Angeles-area school, noticed the sticker and came over to chat. \u201cI\u2019ve got an Apple II also!\u201d he said. Just like that, a lifelong friendship was born.\n The two joined an informal community of fellow travelers, the likes of which could be found in school cafeterias and playgrounds all over the country, swapping tips and exploits and most of all games. Their favorites of the games they traded were the text adventures of Infocom and the  Ultima CRPGs of Origin Systems; if the pair\u2019s friendship was born over the Apple II, it was cemented during the many hours they spent plumbing the depths of   Zorktogether. Matthew  ...\n So many things in life are a question of timing \u2014 not least the careers of game developers. One story which Matthew Engle shared with me when I interviewed him in preparation for this article makes that point disarmingly explicit. In 1986, Daniel, Matthew, and another friend created a BASIC text adventure called  Zapracker, which they attempted to sell through their local software stores. Matthew:\n We made our own boxes and packaged the game with the floppy disk and the manual, just like Richard Garriott did back in the day. Our box was designed to hang on a peg in a software store. We got on a bus with 25 or so copies and visited a few different stores. We\u2019d say, \u201cHey, would you like to sell this on consignment? You get half the money and we get half.\u201d A few stores took us up on it, and we sold a few copies.\n       This tale is indeed almost eerily similar of that of Richard Garriott selling a Ziploc-bagged   Akalabeth through his local Computerland just six years earlier; if anything, our heroes in 1986 would appear to have put  moreeffort into their packaging, and perhaps into their game as well, than Garriott did into his. But in the short span of barely half a decade, the possibility of parlaying a homemade game hanging on a rack in a local computer store into an iconic  ...\n Their game-making efforts were growing steadily more sophisticated, as evinced by Daniel\u2019s choice of programming languages: after starting off in Apple II BASIC, he moved on to an MS-DOS C compiler. Adopting unknowingly the approach that had already been used by everyone from  Scott Adams to  Infocom, from  Telarium to  Polarware to  Magnetic Scrolls, Daniel wrote an interpreter in C which could present a text adventure written in a domain-specific language of his  ...\n During the pair \u2019s last year in high school, the Los Angeles school district and the manufacturing conglomerate Rockwell International co-sponsored a contest for interesting student projects in computer science. Once Daniel and Matthew decided to enter it, it gave them a thing which many creators find invaluable: a deadline. They finished up their game, and submitted it alongside the technological framework that enabled it. They were soon informed that their  ...\n All of the finalists were there, demonstrating their entries. We did a couple of interviews for a local TV station. Then the dinner started. They started running down the list of winners, and before we knew it, it was down to two finalists: my and Dan\u2019s project and another one. Then they announced the other one as second place; we had won. It was quite a night!\n  Daniel and Matthew gave little initial thought to monetizing their big win. After finishing high school in 1989, they went their separate ways, at least in terms of physical location: Daniel moved to New York to study computer science, while Matthew stayed in Los Angeles to study film. But they kept in touch, and soon started talking about making another game, this time in the spirit of their other favorite type from the 1980s: an old-school  Ultima.\n It was 1991 by now, and, fed by the meteoric success of Apogee, shareware games of many different stripes were appearing. Daniel and Matthew as well finally caught the fever. They belatedly released  Skyland\u2019s Star as shareware for $15, using it as a sort of test case for the eventual marketing of their  Ultima-alike. They were among those noble or na\u00efve souls who eschewed the Apogee model in favor of releasing their whole game at once. Instead of offering  ...\n Progress on the\u00a0 Ultima-like game, which was to be called\u00a0  Excelsior Phase I: Lysandia, was inevitably slowed by their respective university studies; the biggest chunk of the work got done in the summers of 1991, 1992, and 1993, when Daniel came back to Los Angeles and they both had more free time. Then they would sit for hours many days at their favorite pizza restaurant, sketching out their plans. Matthew did most of the scenario design, graphics, and  ...\n Calling themselves by now 11th Dimension Entertainment, they finished and released  Excelsior in 1993 as shareware, with a registration price of $20. Once again, they relied on a manual, a hint book, and a map alongside players\u2019 consciences to convince them to register. Although it certainly didn\u2019t become an Apogee-sized success story,  Excelsior did garner more attention and registrations than had  Skyland\u2019s Star. It was helped not only by its being in a  ...\n As they were finishing  Excelsior, Daniel and Matthew had also been finishing their degree programs. Daniel got a programming job at Electronic Arts after a few false starts, while Matthew started a career in Hollywood that would put him, ironically given the retro nature of  Excelsior, on teams making cutting-edge CD-ROM-enabled multimedia products at companies like Disney Interactive. Despite their busy lives, they were both still excited enough by independent  ...\n The sheer quantity of labor which Matthew in particular put into this retro-game with limited commercial prospects could have been motivated only by love. Matthew:\n We went all out. I ultimately made about 3800 16 X 16-pixel tiles. It was an exhausting process. For every tile, I had to specify whether you could walk on it or it would block you. There was also transparency; we had layers of tiles, overlaid upon one another. There might be a grass tile, then the player-character tile. Then, if you\u2019re walking through a doorway, for example, the arch at the top of the doorway.\n Then, after that exhausting process, began the arduous process of putting the tiles down to create the map, which was 500 X 500 tiles if I\u2019m not mistaken \u2014 so, 250,000 tiles to place. Plus all of the town and castle and dungeon maps had to be created.\n By the time they released   Excelsior Phase II: Errondorin 1999, software distribution had changed dramatically from what it had been six years before. It was now feasible to accept credit-card registrations online, and to offer registrants the instant satisfaction of downloadable PDF documents and the like. The motivating ethic of the original shareware movement was alive and well in its way, but, just as with other types of software, the phrase \u201cshareware  ...\n In the end, the two of them sold roughly 500 copies each of  Excelsior I and  II \u2014 \u201csmall potatoes\u201d by any standard, as Matthew freely admits. He believes that they made perhaps $5000 to $10,000 in all on their games, after the cost of postage and all those printed manuals was subtracted.\n I must confess that I personally have some reservations about the 11th Dimension games. It seems to me that  Skyland\u2019s Star\u2018s scenario isn\u2019t quite compelling enough to overcome the engine\u2019s limited parser and lack of player conveniences, and that the  Excelsiorgames, while certainly expansive and carefully put-together, rely a bit too much on needle-in-the-haystack hunting over their enormous maps. Then again, though, I have the exact same complaints  ...\n Shareware gave a place for games like those of Daniel and Matthew to live and breathe when the only other viable mode of distribution was through the boxed publishers, who interested themselves only in a fairly small subset of the things that games can do and be. Long before the likes of Steam, the shareware scene was the indie-games scene of its time, demonstrating all of the quirky spirit which that phrase has come to imply. While the big boys  ...\n ( Sources: the books   Masters of Doom by David Kushner,\u00a0  Rocket Jump: Quake and the Golden Age of First-Person Shooters by David L.

Again, had I known what my future held I would have paid more attention to my surroundings; I retain only the vaguest impression of a chaotic but otherwise unremarkable-looking office. Scott and George were perceptive enough to realize that I would never have fit in with them, and didn \u2019t hire me. For this I bear them no ill will whatsoever,  ...\n The company once known as Apogee, which is now known as 3D Realms, has released  all of their old shareware games for free on their website.

"note_en": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 A team of researchers led by Sandia National Laboratories have invented a first-of-its-kind software for scientists to create accurate digital representations of complex objects.\n  The new software, VoroCrust, offers a novel way to create digital representations, called meshes, which are used by scientists in many disciplines that work with geometric models of all kinds of parts \u2014from rotors to wheels to protective equipment. Complex meshes often have curves, sharp edges or holes. Once created, they look like 3D images that can be used in computer simulations that incorporate algorithms to determine when parts might fail in extreme conditions. This is a helpful \u2014and often  ...\n For example, a scientist in the aerospace industry might make a mesh of an airplane wing and run it through a computer simulation to learn more about what will happen to it in high wind and extreme temperatures. Some scientists also use meshes to model geology to anticipate underground changes, such as subsurface flows of liquids or contaminants.\n VoroCrust incorporates special types of 3D polyhedral cells called Voronoi cells to create the meshes, said Sandia computer scientist and project lead Mohamed Ebeida. Most other mesh-generation methods use 3D tetrahedral or hexahedral cells that can have low quality or are difficult to automate, he said. Existing methods for Voronoi meshing don \u2019t always conform to all corners and angles of complex objects. This can be fixed with manual labor, but it is a tedious process that can take a significant  ...\n VoroCrust is currently being tested by a few other government agencies and universities. The software has one patent, and two additional patent applications have been filed. Research licenses are available through Sandia\u2019s  Intellectual Property office.\n VoroCrust is the first software to generate Voronoi-cell meshes that conform to complex models without needing to be fixed manually, said Ebeida. He\u2019s been working on the software for more than three years and said the software could reduce many hours of manual labor that scientists spend on 3D modeling.\n  \u201cSandia identified meshing as the single biggest bottleneck in these analyses,\u201d Ebeida said. \u201cCurrent practices require human intervention, and VoroCrust provides us with a path toward automating this process to relieve tech staff by reducing the time spent on fixing computer-generated errors in modeling.\u201d\n A recent manuscript describing VoroCrust has been reviewed and accepted in Transaction on Graphics and will be presented in  SIGGRAPH 2020, a top computer graphics conference, Ebeida said, adding \u201cthis is quite an honor.\u201d\n The software was developed in collaboration with the University of Maryland, College Park, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of California, Davis.\n  In 3D modeling, analysts create meshes that look like geometric shells around the objects they need to analyze. Ideally, the mesh will look exactly like the object and conform to all edges, but that\u2019s not always easy using current meshing techniques.\n Common meshing methods typically use the tetrahedral and hexahedral cells to fill the space of an object, starting from the object\u2019s interior toward its outside boundaries However, problems occur when the cells do not conform to the shape near the boundary. Manually fixing this problem is not always reliable and sometimes changes the mathematical properties of the final model, Ebeida said.\n One way to imagine the meshing process is to think of filling a mattress. Tetrahedral \u201ccushions\u201d could fill the space easily, but they might be too firm. Hexahedral cushions could be more flexible but might not follow the edges along the top or corners due to their fixed structure. Using flexible material like a polyhedron that can have arbitrary number of sides could make it easier to fill all areas and corners of the mattress.\n  Ebeida said to fully automate the meshing process, his team not only used polyhedrons, they also reversed the standard approach and found a way to start at the boundary, rather than the middle, of a 3D model. The team carefully placed points, called seeds, around the boundaries of geometrical objects, which then became footholds for Voronoi cells. Once the outside of the boundary is complete, the interior of the object can be filled in with additional Voronoi cells.\n Ahmed Abdelkader, a doctoral student at the University of Maryland, worked on VoroCrust with Ebeida and described the advantages of using Voronoi cells.\n \u201cThe facets are cleaner, like gemstones or diamonds,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can perfectly and naturally fit together.\u201d\n Curves present challenges, Abdelkader said, using the examples of bowls and more complex objects like engines. He said it took a lot of work to pin down the necessary ingredient that would set the pieces together perfectly in a mathematical proof. Now, he said, the team is excited to build upon this deeper understanding to enhance the software with more features.\n \u201cThe Voronoi magic will happen,\u201d Ebeida said. \u201cOnce you decompose the object into these well-shaped pieces, these cells, you can mesh any model you want with confidence about the quality of the resulting mesh without any post-processing.\u201d\n  When working on  VoroCrust, the goal was to create a software robust enough that it could model any object needed for simulation, said Ahmed Mahmoud, a University of California doctoral student who worked on the software.\n Sandia manager Emily Stein and research engineer Tara LaForce have used VoroCrust to make geological models for deep disposal of nuclear waste as part of the Department of Energy\u2019s Spent Fuel and Waste Science and Technology Campaign that Sandia leads. In addition to the  Laboratory Directed Research and Development program, the campaign contributes funding for VoroCrust development.\n Two priorities of the campaign are to create design concepts and numerical modeling approaches for disposal systems. VoroCrust might create a mesh of an underground repository and the waste in it, or it could create a mesh of the underground geology. This mesh can be then used to solve the subsurface flow of liquid or gas in porous material or the transport of contaminants within flowing fluids.\n LaForce said VoroCrust offers promising capabilities for creating a mesh that can run in a reasonable timeframe. Stein added that other meshing methods sometimes distort the mesh, creating a simulation that is not as accurate as it could be.\n  \u201cThe idea is that we could take the geological model as it is and run it without additional manipulation,\u201d LaForce said.\n Carl Gable, the leader of the Computational Earth Sciences group at Los Alamos National Laboratory, has also used VoroCrust to create geological models as part of the campaign.\n \u201cIf you\u2019re making an airplane, submarine or car, one of the first steps is building computational framework you\u2019re trying to represent,\u201d Gable said. \u201cIn our case, it\u2019s geology. We need to represent tunnels, canisters and waste packages, and we also need represent the natural system, the geological system, and VoroCrust is a tool that is good at doing that.\u201d\n  Ebeida said while the research problem of creating geometric meshes with Voronoi cells has been solved, the technical readiness of the software is not at a place where it could be used off-the-shelf.\n Sandia manager Joe Bishop, who\u2019s been interested in VoroCrust for years, said modeling and simulation engineers on his team could benefit from the software for simulations if current software packages can leverage the polyhedral elements.\n \u201cWe need to know if we can run our simulations on these objects and compare it to tetrahedral and hexahedral methods,\u201d he said. \u201cVoroCrust is a promising tool.

But to do that, we first we need to load &amp; decode something:\n // The context is connected to the device speakers. // You only need one of these per document. const  context  =  new  AudioContext (); // Fetch the file fetch ( &#39;sound.mp4&#39; )  // Read it into memory as an arrayBuffer  . then ( response  =&gt;  response . arrayBuffer ())  // Turn it from mp3/aac/whatever into raw audio data  . then ( arrayBuffer  =&gt;  context . decodeAudioData ( arrayBuffer ))  . then ( audioBuffer  =&gt;  {  // Now we&#39;re ready to play!  });\n Unfortunately we need to work around a few things in Safari. We need to use  webkitAudioContext - Safari doesn&#39;t support the unprefixed version. It doesn&#39;t support  fetch yet (it&#39;s  in development) so we&#39;ll  need to use XHR). And  decodeAudioData doesn&#39;t support promises, so we&#39;ll  need to polyfill that.\n  // Create a source: // This represents a playback head. const  source  =  context . createBufferSource (); // Give it the audio data we loaded: source . buffer  =  audioBuffer ; // Plug it into the output: source . connect ( context . destination ); // And off we go! source . start ();\n   So yeah, it&#39;s way more complicated than just using  &lt;audio src=&#34;\u2026&#34;&gt; to play a sound, but web audio can do so much more. The amount of control web audio gives you is great fun, but also kinda daunting. In this post I&#39;m just going to scratch the surface, and look at how to loop and queue sounds.\n    We tried to make it as ridiculous as possible, and the music was a big part of that. The music was produced by  Plan8, and it only took them a day to compose (we misread the licence on a piece of music we were going to use, so the deadline was  our fault. Anyway, the music they made is way better). They also have JS libraries for scheduling audio, but hey I was in the mood for some procrastination, so I did it myself.\n  The music in the Big Web Quiz has three phases, and we wanted to switch between them during questions. Using the code above, I loaded three buffers,  phase1AudioBuffer,  phase2AudioBuffer, and  stabAudioBuffer, each representing a different phase of Big Web Quiz&#39;s music.\n A naive solution is to play phase 1, then later stop it and play phase 2:\n const  phase1Source  =  context . createBufferSource (); phase1Source . buffer  =  phase1AudioBuffer ; phase1Source . connect ( context . destination ); phase1Source . start (); // Then later\u2026 const  phase2Source  =  context . createBufferSource (); phase2Source . buffer  =  phase2AudioBuffer ; phase2Source . connect ( context . destination ); // Stop phase 1 phase1Source . stop (); // Start phase 2 phase2Source . start ();\n    Even though we have our audio data loaded in memory, there&#39;s still a gap between us calling  start() and the audio actually playing.\n This is fine if you want the sound to play as soon as possible and don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s a few milliseconds out, such as playing a sound in a game when the player collects a coin, but when syncronising two clips things need to be precise.\n To do anything precise with audio, you need to schedule things in advance. Both  start and  stop take an optional number, the time to actually start/stop, and  context.currentTime gives you the current time as far as the audio context is concerned.\n How much advance notice you have to give depends on hardware, but  Chris Wilson reliably informs me that a quarter of a second is super-safe more-than-enough, even for slow hardware.\n   A quarter of a second is a long delay, but in this case syncronisation is more important to us than immediacy.\n Note: In the web audio API, time is in seconds, whereas most other web APIs use milliseconds.\n   Encoding audio down to formats like MP3 or AAC is a lossy process, but you at least get to pick the encoder. When you use  decodeAudioData you&#39;re relying on whatever decoder the browser uses, and this may come as a shock, but sometimes different browsers do things differently.\n   The original clip is gapless at the start/end, but if you&#39;re in Chrome stable, Firefox, or Edge, you&#39;ll see a huge gap. By huge I mean 45 milliseconds, but y&#39;know, that&#39;s a big deal when we&#39;re trying to instantly switch between two clips.\n The gap is almost gone in Chrome Canary. Safari on the other hand gets it spot-on, no gap at all.\n In the first draft of this article I congratulated Safari on a job well done, but actual expert  Paul Adenot from Mozilla dropped a few knowledge bombs on me (in a friendly way of course).\n The gap at the start is specified by the encoder as metadata. From  Apple&#39;s documentation:\n \u2026encoders add at least 1024 samples of silence before the first \u2018true\u2019 audio sample, and often add more. This is called variously \u201cpriming\u201d, \u201cpriming samples\u201d, or \u201cencoder delay\u201d\u2026\n Therefore, a playback system must trim the silent priming samples to preserve correct synchronization. This trimming by the playback system should be done in two places:\n When the playback position is moved to another location. For example, the user skips ahead or back to another part of the media and begins playback from that new location.\n The question is, should the browser remove the &#34;priming samples&#34; as part of  decodeAudioData, or are we (as users of the web audio API) the &#34;playback system&#34;, meaning we have to deal with it.\n I still feel that Safari is doing the right thing here, especially as finding out the number of priming samples from the metadata is really non-trivial. To try and bring some consistency here,  I&#39;ve filed an issue with the spec.\n In the meantime, we can work around the gap by finding out how long it is:\n function  findStartGapDuration ( audioBuffer )  {  // Get the raw audio data for the left &amp; right channels.  const  l  =  audioBuffer . getChannelData ( 0 );  const  r  =  audioBuffer . getChannelData ( 1 );  // Each is an array of numbers between -1 and 1 describing  // the waveform, sample by sample.  // Now to figure out how long both channels remain at 0:  for  ( let  i  =  0 ;  i  &lt;  l . length ;  i ++ )  {  if  ( l [ i ]  ||  r [ i ])  {  // Now we know which sample is non-zero, but we want  // the gap in seconds,  ...\n Once we have the gap, we can use source&#39;s second parameter to start playback at that point, after the silence:\n const  phase1StartGap  =  findStartGapDuration ( phase1AudioBuffer ); const  phase1Source  =  context . createBufferSource (); phase1Source . buffer  =  phase1AudioBuffer ; phase1Source . connect ( context . destination ); // Cater for the gap: phase1Source . start ( context . currentTime  +  safetyBuffer ,  phase1StartGap ); // Then later\u2026 const  phase2StartGap  =  findStartGapDuration ( phase2AudioBuffer ); const  phase2Source  =  context . createBufferSource (); phase2Source . buffer  =  phase2AudioBuffer ; phase2Source . connect  ...\n   Better, but not perfect. Depending on when you press the button, the switch from phase 2 to the end stab can feel mistimed, but we can fix that\u2026\n  Ideally we want the phases to switch right at the end of a musical bar. Phase 1 is 110bpm, and phase 2 is 123bpm, so we can figure out the duration of each bar:\n function  getBarDuration ( bpm ,  beatsPerBar )  {  return  60  /  bpm  *  beatsPerBar ; } const  phase1BarDuration  =  getBarDuration ( 110 ,  4 );  const  phase2BarDuration  =  getBarDuration ( 123 ,  4 );\n We want to switch the phases at the end of the next bar, unless that&#39;s less than our  safetyBuffer, in which case we want to switch at the end of the following bar.\n function  getPhaseSwitchTime ( currentTime ,  phaseStartTime ,  barDuration )  {  // How long the phase has been playing:  const  phasePlaybackPosition  =  currentTime  -  phaseStartTime ;  // How long has it been playing the current bar:  const  positionWithinBar  =  phasePlaybackPosition  %  barDuration ;  // How long until the next bar:  let  untilSwitch  =  barDuration  -  positionWithinBar ;  // If it&#39;s less than our safetyBuffer, add another bar:  if  ( untilSwitch  &lt;  safetyBuffer )  untilSwitch  ...\n Unfortunately the web audio API doesn&#39;t tell us the current playblack position of a source ( it might eventually), so we have to track that ourselves:\n const  phase1StartTime  =  context . currentTime  +  safetyBuffer ;  phase1Source . start ( phase1StartTime ,  phase1StartGap ); // Then later\u2026 const  phase2StartTime  =  getPhaseSwitchTime ( context . currentTime ,  phase1StartTime ,  phase1BarDuration ); phase1Source . stop ( phase2StartTime ); phase2Source . start ( phase2StartTime ,  phase2StartGap );\n   Sometimes switching between clips can cause a click if the samples don&#39;t join at a zero value. If you get this, you can use a  gain node to create a really short, imperceptible, fade-out and fade-in.\n     This is a single source that loops, but the loop-points change dynamically. Compared to what we&#39;ve done already, looping a clip is pretty simple:\n // Cater for buggy AAC decoders as before: const  sonicStartGap  =  findStartGapDuration ( sonicAudioBuffer ); // Create the source: const  sonicSource  =  context . createBufferSource (); sonicSource . buffer  =  sonicAudioBuffer ; sonicSource . connect ( context . destination ); // Loop it! sonicSource . loop  =  true ; // Set loop points: sonicSource . loopStart  =  loopStartTime  +  sonicStartGap ; sonicSource . loopEnd  =  loopEndTime  +  sonicStartGap ; // Play! sonicSource . start ( 0 ,  sonicStartGap );\n     Tools like  Audacity (free) and  Adobe Audition (not so free) are great for chopping and looping audio.\n Once we&#39;ve found the loop points, we need to find the  sample they start &amp; end on. This is the most accurate measurement we&#39;ll get.\n  const  loopPoints  =  [  { start :  328948 ,  end :  656828 },  { start :  985007 ,  end :  1314119 },  { start :  1643272 ,  end :  1972421 },  { start :  1972421 ,  end :  2137288 }, ];\n  const  loopPointTimes  =  loopPoints . map ( loop  =&gt;  ({  start :  loop . start  /  48000  +  sonicStartGap ,  end :  loop . end  /  48000  +  sonicStartGap }));\n 48000 needs to be replaced with the sample rate of the clip as viewed in Audacity. Don&#39;t do what I did &amp; use  buffer.sampleRate, as the decoded sample rate can be different to the sample rate of the file. Audio is decoded to  context.sampleRate, which is 44,100 on my mac, but 48,000 on my phone.\n  At the end of the demo above, the clip loops back to an earlier point. Unfortunately, if you set  loopEnd to a point earlier than the current playback point, it immediately goes back to  loopStart, whereas we want it to play through to the end,  then go back to an earlier loop.\n The least hacky way to do this would be to stop  sonicSource looping, and queue up a new  sonicSource2 to start looping once  sonicSource reaches its natural finish.\n However, to do this, we&#39;d need to know the current playback position of  sonicSource, and as I mentioned earlier, this  feature hasn&#39;t landed yet. We can&#39;t even reliably work around this - the source has been looping all over the place, and we can&#39;t be sure each write to  loopStart and  loopEnd made it to the sound card in time. I&#39;m hacking it for the purposes of the visualisations above, but it isn&#39;t accurate enough for sound.\n To work around this we make two changes to the loop. We loop from the start of the earlier loop, right to the end of the clip. Then, once the clip has played past the end, we change  loopEnd to the end of the earlier loop.\n // Current loop start const  currentLoopStart  =  sonicSource . loopStart ;  // The earlier loop we want to move to. const  targetLoop  =  loopPointTimes [ 1 ]; // The point we want to reach before looping back. // sonicSource.duration is not good enough here, due to // the AAC decoding bug mentioned earlier. const  endSample  =  658624 ; const  endTime  =  endSample  /  48000  +  sonicStartGap ; // Play to the end, then loop back to the start: sonicSource . loopStart  =  targetLoop . start  ...\n endTime - currentLoopStart is the maximum time the clip could play before it loops back to  targetLoop.start, after that it&#39;s safe to move the end point. Done!\n While the web audio API isn&#39;t something you&#39;ll use in every project, it&#39;s suprisingly powerful and fun. If you&#39;re wanting to dig a little deeper, I recommend this  multi-part guide by  Tero Parviainen.\n Speaking of procrastination, I really should be getting back to the service worker spec\u2026",

While that is a sentiment with which I can wholeheartedly agree, I found it ironic that this programmer seemed not to realize that I had used Lisp as my primary language for 15 years of my career. It reminded me of this Johnny Cash song:\n    I was totin\u2019 my laptop at a trendy Palo Alto cafe  When I passed a hacker bro\u2019 with a new 16 inch display \u201cIf you\u2019re goin\u2019 to be

"note_en": "Round 5 of Gitcoin Grants has just finished, with $250,000 of matching split between tech, media, and the new (non-Ethereum-centric) category of &#34;public health&#34;. In general, it seems like the mechanism and the community are settling down into a regular rhythm. People know what it means to contribute, people know what to expect, and the results emerge in a relatively predictable pattern - even if which specific grants get the most funds is not so easy to predict.\n       So let&#39;s go straight into the analysis. One important property worth looking at is stability of income across rounds: do projects that do well in round N also tend to do well in round N+1? Stability of income is very important if we want to support an ecosystem of &#34;quadratic freelancers&#34;: we want people to feel comfortable relying on their income knowing that it will not completely disappear the next round. On the other hand, it would be harmful if some recipients became completely  ...\n     Week in Ethereum had the highest total amount received in both  the previous round and the current round. EthHub and Bankless are also near the top in both the current round and the previous round. On the other hand, Antiprosynthesis, the (beloved? notorious? famous?) Twitter info-warrior, has decreased from $13,813 to $5,350, while  Chris Blec&#39;s YouTube channel has  increased from $5,851 to $12,803. So some churn, but also some continuity between rounds.\n On the tech side, we see much more churn in the winners, with a less clear relationship between income last round and income this round:\n    Last round, the winner was Tornado Cash, claiming $30,783; this round, they are down to $8,154. This round, the three roughly-even winners are  Samczsun ($4,631 contributions + $15,704 match = $20,335 total),  Arboreum ($16,084 contributions + $9,046 match = $25,128 total) and  1inch.exchange ($58,566 contributions + $7,893 match = $66,459 total), in the latter case the bulk coming from one contribution:\n     In the previous round, those three winners were not even in the top ten, and in some cases not even part of Gitcoin Grants at all.\n These numbers show us two things. First, large parts of the Gitcoin community seem to be in the mindset of treating grants not as a question of &#34;how much do you deserve for your last two months of work?&#34;, but rather as a one-off reward for years of contributions in the past. This was one of the strongest rebuttals that I received to my  criticism of Antiprosynthesis receiving $13,813 in the last round: that the people who contributed to that award did not see it as two months&#39;  ...\n That said, not everyone contributes in this way. For example, Prysm got $7,966 last round and $8,033 this round, and Week in Ethereum is consistently well-rewarded ($16,727 previous, $22,237 current), and EthHub saw less stability but still kept half its income ($13,515 previous, $6,705 current) even amid a 20% drop to the matching pool size as some funds were redirected to public health. So there definitely are some contributors that  aregetting almost a reasonable monthly salary  ...\n  One feature that was tested this round to try to improve stability was recurring contributions: users could choose to split their contribution among multiple rounds. However, the feature was not used often: out of over 8,000 total contributions, only 120 actually made recurring contributions. I can think of three possible explanations for this:\n People just don&#39;t want to give recurring contributions; they genuinely prefer to freshly rethink who they are supporting every round.\n People would be willing to give more recurring contributions, but there is some kind of &#34;market failure&#34; stopping them; that is, it&#39;s collectively optimal for everyone to give more recurring contributions, but it&#39;s not any individual contributor&#39;s interest to be the first to do so.\n In a recent call with the Gitcoin team, hypothesis (3) was mentioned frequently. A specific issue was that people were worried about making recurring contributions because they were concerned whether or not the money that they lock up for a recurring contribution would be safe. Improving the payment system and notification workflow may help with this. Another option is to move away from explicit &#34;streaming&#34; and instead simply have the UI provide an option for repeating  ...\n Hypothesis (1) also should be taken seriously; there&#39;s genuine value in preventing ossification and allowing space for new entrants. But I want to zoom in particularly on hypothesis (2), the coordination failure hypothesis.\n My explanation of hypothesis (2) starts, interestingly enough, with a defense of (1): why ossification is genuinely a risk. Suppose that there are two projects, A and B, and suppose that they are equal quality. But A already has an established base of contributors; B does not (we&#39;ll say for illustration it only has a few existing contributors). Here&#39;s how much matching you are contributing by participating in each project:\n    Clearly, you have more impact by supporting A, and so A gets even more contributors and B gets fewer; the rich get richer. Even if project B was  somewhat better, the greater impact from supporting A could still create a lock-in that reinforces A&#39;s position. The current everyone-starts-from-zero-in-each-round mechanism greatly limits this type of entrenchment, because, well, everyone&#39;s matching gets reset and starts from zero.\n However, a very similar effect also is the cause behind the market failure preventing stable recurring contributions, and the every-round-reset  actually exacerbates it. Look at the same picture above, except instead of thinking of A and B as  two different projects, think of them as  the same project in the current round and in the next round.\n We simplify the model as follows. An individual has two choices: contribute $10 in the current round, or contribute $5 in the current round and $5 in the next round. If the matchings in the two rounds were equal, then the latter option would actually be more favorable: because the matching is proportional to the square root of the donation size, the former might give you eg. a $200 match now, but the latter would give you $141 in the current round + $141 in the next round  ...\n    So there is a substantial region within which the bad equilibrium of everyone concentrating is sticky: if more than about 3/4 of contributors are expected to concentrate, it seems in your interest to also concentrate. A mathematically astute reader may note that there is  always some intermediate strategy that involves splitting but at a ratio different from 50/50, which you can prove performs better than either full concentrating  orthe even split, but here we get back  ...\n How might we fix this? One option is to add a bit of continuity to matching ratios: when computing pairwise matches, match against not just the current round&#39;s contributors but, say, 1/3 of the previous round&#39;s contributors as well:\n    This makes some philosophical sense: the objective of quadratic funding is to subsidize contributions to projects that are detected to be public goods because multiple people have contributed to them, and contributions in the previous round are certainly also evidence of a project&#39;s value, so why not reuse those? So here, moving away from everyone-starts-from-zero toward this partial carryover of matching ratios would mitigate the round concentration effect - but,  ...\n  This round also introduced negative contributions, a feature proposed in my  review of the previous round. But as with recurring contributions, very few people made negative contributions, to the point where their impact on the results was negligible. Also, there was  active  opposition to  negative  contributions:\n      The main source of opposition was basically what I predicted in the previous round. Adding a mechanism that allows people to penalize others, even if deservedly so, can have tricky and easily harmful social consequences. Some people even opposed the negative contribution mechanism to the point where they took care to give positive contributions to everyone who received a negative contribution.\n How do we respond? To me it seems clear that, in the long run,  somemechanism of filtering out bad projects, and ideally compensating for overexcitement into good projects, will have to exist. It doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be integrated as a symmetric part of the QF, but there does need to be a filter of some form. And this mechanism, whatever form it will take, invariably opens up the possibility of the same social dynamics. So there is a challenge that will  ...\n One approach would be to hide more information: instead of just hiding  whomade a negative contribution, outright hide the fact that a negative contribution was made. Many opponents of negative contributions explicitly indicated that they would be okay (or at least more okay) with such a model. And indeed (see the next section), this is a direction we will have to go anyway. But it would come at a cost - effectively hiding negative contributions would mean not  ...\n       It does seem clear that, at current scales, stronger protections against manipulation are goingto be required. The first thing that can be done is adding a stronger identity verification layer than Github accounts; this is something that the Gitcoin team is already working on. There is definitely a complex tradeoff between security and inclusiveness to be worked through, but it is not especially difficult to implement a first version. And if the identity problem  ...\n MACI is the solution that I proposed (and Barry Whitehat and co are implementing) to solve this problem. Essentially, MACI is a cryptographic construction that allows for contributions to projects to happen on-chain in a privacy-preserving, encrypted form, that allows anyone to cryptographically verify that the mechanism is being implemented  correctly, but prevents participants from being able to prove to a third party that they made any particular contribution.  ...\n However, we do need to think through some of the second-order consequences that integrating MACI would introduce. The biggest blessing, and curse, of using MACI is that contributions become hidden. Identities necessarily become hidden, but even the exact timing of contributions would need to be hidden to prevent deanonymization through timing (to prove that  youcontributed, make the total amount jump up between 17:40 and 17:42 today). Instead, for example,  ...\n The challenge with hiding contributions is that we lose the &#34;social proof&#34; motivator for contributing: if contributions are unprovable you can&#39;t as easily publicly brag about a contribution you made. My best proposal for solving this is for the mechanism to publish one extra number: the  totalamount that a particular participant contributed (counting only projects that have received at least 10 contributors to prevent inflating one&#39;s number  ...\n  All in all, Gitcoin Grants is establishing itself as a significant pillar of the Ethereum ecosystem that more and more projects are relying on for some or all of their support. While it has a relatively low amount of funding at present, and so inevitably underfunds almost everything it touches, we hope that over time we&#39;ll continue to see larger sources of funding for the matching pools appear. One option is  MEV auctions, another is that new or existing  ...\n    Additionally, this round saw Gitcoin Grants&#39; first foray into applications beyond Ethereum with the health section. There is growing interest in quadratic funding from local government bodies and other non-blockchain groups, and it would be very valuable to see quadratic funding more broadly deployed in such contexts. That said, there are unique challenges there too. First, there&#39;s issues around onboarding people who do not already have cryptocurrency.  ...", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:06:36", "tags": "\u91d1\u5e01,grants,\u4eba\u4eec,contributions", "title":

business owner, you might be struggling to balance demands for online delivery, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n  These days, you need to serve customers where they are. But this can be challenging when delivery services are expensive and setting them up can be time-consuming.\n  HERE WeGo Deliver helps you start your own delivery routing quickly and efficiently, with no fees till the end of 2020.\n    Let our tool do the work for you. Drag and drop your orders into HERE WeGo Deliver as a CSV file or upload them from e-commerce platforms like Shopify and Weebly to calculate driver routes immediately.\n  Cut out the middleman and run your own deliveries. Our tool helps you plan ahead and make the most of your vehicle and driver capacity.\n  Dispatch delivery routes to your drivers easily. HERE WeGo Deliver calculates the quickest routes based on current traffic conditions to help them avoid delays on the road.\n  Sync your delivery routes with HERE WeGo, our navigation app \u2014 available across all platforms. Help drivers find each delivery stop with turn-by-turn voice navigation and offline access even when mobile signal is lost.\n  We are making HERE WeGo Deliver free through the end of 2020 to help retail businesses quickly adapt to the need to offer deliveries to their customers.\n    HERE WeGo Deliver accepts delivery jobs in CSV format.  An example template is available for download.\n  The file has fields for order ID, customer name, phone number, email, address, start and end times for the delivery window, service time (how long the delivery will take) and \u201cdemand\u201d (an estimate of size, weight, volume, etc.).\n You only need the address to create plans. The other fields are there to help you and your drivers keep track of information about the delivery jobs. You may refer to the template to see examples of how different delivery jobs might look.\n  You can create and modify CSV files in a spreadsheet editor like Microsoft Excel, Numbers, LibreOffice Calc, or Google Sheets.\n  Each tour can be separately exported and shared as a PDF run sheet or as an email you can send directly to your drivers.\n  Phone numbers that are included in the uploaded CSV file will be available and visible to drivers in the PDF version of the run sheet.\n    Yes, HERE WeGo is designed for use with your current workforce. HERE does not provide drivers or driver service recommendations.\n  HERE WeGo, used by HERE WeGo Deliver as a turn-by-turn navigation app, is available as a free download on Android in the Google Play Store and iOS in the App Store. For Huawei owners, it is also available via AppGallery.\n  Get in touch via the \u201cContact us\u201d link on the bottom right of the HERE WeGo Deliver page or send an email to  wegodeliver@here.com\n    We do not take traffic into account but use an approximation for the travel time and distance. However, the HERE WeGo mobile app uses traffic in routing, and provides ETAs based on current traffic conditions.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:06:32", "tags":

"note_en": "Omega-3, a fatty acid commonly found in fish oil, may have long-term neurodevelopmental effects that ultimately reduce antisocial and aggressive behavior problems in children, a new study suggests.\n At the forefront of a field known as &#34;neurocriminology,&#34; Adrian Raine of the University of Pennsylvania has long studied the interplay between biology and environment when it comes to antisocial and criminal behavior. With strong physiological evidence that disruption to the emotion-regulating parts of the brain can manifest in violent outbursts, impulsive decision-making and other behavioral traits associated with crime, much of Raine&#39;s research involves looking at biological  ...\n    A new study by Raine now suggests that omega-3, a fatty acid commonly found in fish oil, may have long-term neurodevelopmental effects that ultimately reduce antisocial and aggressive behavior problems in children.\n He is a Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor with appointments in the School of Arts &amp; Sciences and the Perelman School of Medicine.\n Along with Raine, the study featured Jill Portnoy a graduate student in the Department of Criminology, and Jianghong Liu, an associate professor in the Penn School of Nursing. They collaborated with Tashneem Mahoomed of Mauritius&#39; Joint Child Health Project and Joseph Hibbeln of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n  When Raine was a graduate student, he, his advisor and colleagues conducted a longitudinal study of children in the small island nation of Mauritius. The researchers tracked the development of children who had participated in an enrichment program as 3-year-olds and also the development of children who had not participated. This enrichment program had additional cognitive stimulation, physical exercise and nutritional enrichment. At 11 years, the participants showed a marked improvement  ...\n     Raine and his colleagues were interested in teasing apart the mechanisms behind this improvement. Other studies suggested the nutritional component was worth a closer look.\n &#34;We saw children who had poor nutritional status at age 3 were more antisocial and aggressive at 8, 11 and 17,&#34; Raine said. &#34;That made us look back at the intervention and see what stood out about the nutritional component. Part of the enrichment was that the children receiving an extra two and a half portions of fish a week.&#34;\n Other research at the time was beginning to show that omega-3 is critical to brain development and function.\n &#34;Omega-3 regulates neurotransmitters, enhances the life of a neuron and increases dendritic branching, but our bodies do not produce it. We can only get it from the environment,&#34; Raine said.\n Research on the neuroanatomy of violent criminals suggested this might be a place to intervene. Other brain-imaging researchers have shown that omega-3 supplementation increases the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region Raine found to have higher rates of damage or dysfunction in criminal offenders.\n     Raine&#39;s new study featured a randomized controlled trial where children would receive regular omega-3 supplements in the form of a juice drink. One hundred children, aged 8 to 16, would each receive a drink containing a gram of omega-3 once a day for six months, matched with 100 children who received the same drink without the supplement. The children and parents in both groups took a series of personality assessments and questionnaires at the start.\n After six months, the researchers administered a simple blood test to see if the children in the experimental group had higher levels of omega-3 than those in the controls. They also had both parents and children take the personality assessments. Six months after that, the researchers had parents and children take the assessment again to see if there were any lasting effects from the supplements.\n The assessments had parents rate their children on &#34;externalizing&#34; aggressive and antisocial behavior, such as getting into fights or lying, as well as &#34;internalizing&#34; behavior, such as depression, anxiety and withdrawal. Children were also asked to rate themselves on these traits.\n While the children&#39;s self-reports remained flat for both groups, the average rate of antisocial and aggressive behavior as described by the parents dropped in both groups by the six-month point. Critically, however, those rates returned to the baseline for the control group but remained lowered in the experimental group, at the 12-month point.\n &#34;Compared to the baseline at zero months,&#34; Raine said, &#34;both groups show improvement in both the externalizing and internalizing behavior problems after six months. That&#39;s the placebo effect.\n &#34;But what was particularly interesting was what was happening at 12 months. The control group returned to the baseline while the omega-3 group continued to go down. In the end, we saw a 42 percent reduction in scores on externalizing behavior and 62 percent reduction in internalizing behavior.&#34;\n At both the six- and 12-month check-ins, parents also answered questionnaires about their own behavioral traits. Surprisingly, parents also showed an improvement in their antisocial and aggressive behavior. This could be explained by the parents taking some of their child&#39;s supplement, or simply because of a positive response to their child&#39;s own behavioral improvement.\n The researchers caution that this is still preliminary work in uncovering the role nutrition plays in the link between brain development and antisocial behavior. The changes seen in the one-year period of the experiment may not last, and the results may not be generalizable outside the unique context of Mauritius.\n Beyond these caveats, however, there is reason to further examine omega-3&#39;s role as a potential early intervention for antisocial behavior.\n &#34;As a protective factor for reducing behavior problems in children,&#34; Liu said, &#34;nutrition is a promising option; it is relatively inexpensive and can be easy to manage.&#34;\n Follow-up studies will include longer-term surveillance of children&#39;s behavioral traits and will investigate why their self-reports did not match the parental reports.\n    Materials provided by   University of Pennsylvania.

weird happened on the oil market last week. For a few minutes on April 20, the price of a barrel went  negativefor the first time ever. The unprecedented collapse of prices is linked to the pandemic, which has caused people to stop doing oil-guzzling things like flying and driving. There \u2019s now so much extra petroleum on the market that the world is running out of places to put it. If you \u2019re an oil producer, it seems like the sensible thing to do in this situation would be to \u2026stop producing  ...\n On Friday, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia, the US, and others will begin scaling back their production by nearly 10 million barrels per day. They hope that this will help stabilize prices and take some pressure off of producers and refineries that are scrambling to find a place to store the excess. But the rollback isn \u2019t likely to be enough. Oil producers would have to reduce production by almost three times that amount to match the downturn in demand.  ...\n   The short answer is because temporarily closing or \u201cshutting in\u201d a well costs money\u2014and potentially  lotsof money. It \u2019s not just about the foregone revenue, which is less of a concern when prices are dipping into the negative. It \u2019s about what happens when the well is opened back up. \u201cShutting in a well is not especially difficult, \u201dsays Eric van Oort, a petroleum engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. It \u2019s mostly a matter of shutting off a master valve at the surface, much like turning  ...\n The US has been the largest producer of crude oil in the world for the past two years, and the vast majority is dredged up in Texas and on offshore derricks in the Gulf of Mexico. On land, most of America\u2019s crude is produced from shale reservoirs, which trap the oil in rocks with low permeability. To set it free, companies use a technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that opens cracks in rocks deep in the Earth by blasting them with water or gas.\n  Shut-ins are a normal part of oil production, but they are usually limited to a few wells at a time and mostly undertaken for repairs. Petroleum producers have known for decades that shale wells that have previously been shut in produce less oil when they \u2019re reopened, says John McLennan, an expert in geomechanics at the University of Utah Energy and Geoscience Institute. But the exact cause of the damage is often unclear. McLennan says that one of the most well-supported explanations is water  ...\n  A well typically taps into a mixture of oil and water. Both are pumped to the surface, but the water is treated as waste. When a well is shut in, the ratio of oil to water is recalibrated, since there\u2019s no longer a big pipe sucking on the fissures in the rock. Because the rock in shale wells isn\u2019t very permeable, water may accumulate in the fractures. When the well opens up again, it may end up producing more water than oil, because the accumulated H 2O impedes the movement of oil. Shale wells  ...\n Van Oort says the amount of time a well is closed doesn\u2019t really affect how much damage the shut-in inflicts on the reservoir. Once the well is closed, the damage is done. If producers have to repeatedly shut the well, the damage can compound over time and reduce productivity even more. \u201cIt is always best to leave the well alone once you go to production,\u201d says van Oort.\n  The situation is a bit better for the roughly 1,000 offshore oil derricks in the Gulf of Mexico. These are typically conventional wells where a pipe is drilled into the ground and oil is pumped up\u2014almost like  sucking a milkshakethrough a straw. Offshore oil producers are accustomed to temporarily turning wells off during hurricanes, and shut-ins don \u2019t have as big of a negative effect on their ability to produce oil. The reason for this, says McLennan, is because the offshore reservoirs are more  ...\n But even though offshore reservoirs might not sustain as much damage from shut-ins, McLennan says the wells are a bit more challenging to turn off. Some subsea pipelines may need to be protected if the oil contains waxy paraffins, which can solidify in pipelines at the bottom of the ocean, where temperatures are just a few degrees above freezing. So before an offshore well can be turned off, there \u2019s often a lot of preventative maintenance that needs to be done, like flushing the pipes and filling  ...\n Although the OPEC agreement to reduce production officially begins on Friday, many US producers started shutting their wells weeks ago in response to dismally low prices. These shut-ins have largely been led by the roughly 2,000 small independent and private oil companies in the US, most of which produce less than 20,000 barrels per day. \u201cThe brunt of the pain is being felt by small companies with fewer wells, \u201dsays Frederick Lawerence, vice president of economics and international affairs at  ...\n Smaller independent and private companies don \u2019t have many of the advantages afforded to large independents or global companies like BP or ConocoPhillips. Bigger companies have priority access to pipelines and storage, and also tend to have diversified revenue streams \u2014they don \u2019t just produce the oil, they also refine it, transport it and so on. Smaller companies, by contrast, are \u201ctotally dependent on the wellhead, \u201dLawerence says. Without significant storage capacity, they have no choice but  ...\n Large companies may be able to cushion the blow from the drop in demand, but even they are not immune to shut-ins. According to a  Wall Street Journal  report last week, offshore drillers have already started shutting in wells, and they will close more in the near future to meet the reduced production targets that the US and other countries agreed to in April.\n Lawrence says that widespread shut-ins of both conventional and fracked oil wells is unprecedented. He expects the wave of shut-ins will result in some consolidation among smaller producers or acquisitions by larger companies. Covid-19 won\u2019t kill American oil, he says, but \u201cwhat has transpired will ultimately change the nature of the industry that emerges.\u201d\n   \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Want the best tools to get healthy?

"note_en": "When the garden eels at a Tokyo aquarium remove their heads from the sand, they are usually confronted by pairs of human eyes staring back at them through the glass.\n But  like other animals around the world, the eels at Sumida Aquarium are finding their environment transformed by the effects of the  coronavirus outbreak.\n They also appear to be forgetting what humans look like. Concerned that the garden eels \u2013 so named because their grass-like appearance when, en masse, they poke their heads out of the seabed \u2013 could come to see visitors as a threat, the aquarium is asking people to get in touch in the form of a calming video calls.\n The aquarium, housed in Tokyo Skytree \u2013 Japan\u2019s tallest structure \u2013 has been closed since the start of March and its garden eels have become used to a largely human-free environment.\n But the aquarium said the \u201cunprecedented situation\u201d had had put the eels and other creatures ill at ease.\n  \u201cThey don\u2019t see humans, except keepers, and they have started forgetting about humans,\u201d it said on its Twitter account this week.\n \u201cGarden eels in particular disappear into the sand and hide every time the keepers pass by,\u201d it said, adding that their oversensitive nature was making it difficult to monitor their health.\n \u201cHere is an urgent request,\u201d the aquarium wrote. \u201cCould you show your face to our garden eels from your home?\u201d it said, naming the event a \u201cface-showing festival\u201d.\n While garden eels are sensitive and wary by nature, the 300 of them living in one of the aquarium\u2019s tanks had grown accustomed to human visitors and rarely hid when approached by visitors.\n To help the eels reconnect with their admirers, the aquarium is setting up five tablets facing their tank, with users asked to connect through iPhones or iPads via the FaceTime app.\n Once the video calls start, people are asked to show their faces, wave and talk to the eels. But, given the animals\u2019 natural bashfulness, they are requested not to raise their voices.\n The festival is scheduled for 3-5 May, at the height of the Golden Week holiday, when many people who would normally travel are staying home during the country\u2019s Covid-19 state of emergency.\n The aquarium\u2019s plea has attracted lots of online support, under the Japanese hashtag \u001d#PleaseRememberHumans.\n \u201c\u2018When you gaze at the garden eels, the garden eels gaze at you.\u2019 Understood. I\u2019m happy to take part,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.\n \u201cThey need training to learn humans are not a threat!\u201d another wrote. \u201cInteresting.\u201d\n Many called on the aquarium to offer access to the eels via another app to allow those using PCs and phones with Android operating systems to take part.", "posttime": "2020-05-02 18:06:23", "tags":

"note_en": "NUBIA is a SoTA evaluation metric for text generation. It stands for NeUral Based Interchangeability Assessor. In addition to returning an interchangeability score, NUBIA also returns scores for semantic relation, contradiction, irrelevancy, logical agreement, and grammaticality.\n     Nubia is composed of three modules. The first is neural feature extraction. The three main neural features that power the metric are semantic similarity, logical inference, and sentence legibility. These are extracted by exposing layers from powerful (pretrained) language models: RoBERTa STS for semantic similarity, RoBERTa MNLI for logical inference, and GPT-2 for sentence legibility.\n The second module is the aggregator. This module is trained to approximate a function mapping input neural features to a quality score that reflects how interchangeable the sentences are. The objective is to come as close as possible to human evaluation.\n The final module is calibration. This is necessary because the aggregator is not bound between 0 and 1, nor does a regressed score comparing a reference sentence with itself always ouput 1. So to calibrate, the output is normalized against the score of the reference sentence compared with itself, and bound between 0 and 1.\n  We have been able to achieve SoTA performance in assessing the quality of machine translation and image captioning. Results below are the Absolute Pearson correlations with segment-level human judgments on WMT17 to-English translations.\n  Results below are the Kendall\u2019s Tau correlations with human judgment on the Flickr 8K dataset.\n  Nubia is especially powerful against BLEU and ROUGE. The following are the score and label graphs of Nubia, ROUGE-L and BLEU for the entire WMT-2017 segment level set.\n    s1, s2 = &#34;He agreed to a proposal of mine.&#34;,&#34;He gave his agreement to my proposal.&#34;\n but the BLEU, ROUGE and BERTScore are low (0.43, 0.28, 0.63) whereas the Nubia score is 0.95\n Rouge_1 is: 0.4285714235714286Rouge_2 is: 0.0BlEU is: 0.2802636449867835BERTScore is: (0.5967282652854919, 0.6308560967445374, 0.6143679618835449)Nubia Score: 0.9504227034094436Semantic relation: 4.672990322113037/5.0Percent chance of contradiction: 0.26220036670565605%Percent chance of irrelevancy or new information: 0.5306123290210962%Percent chance of logical agreement: 99.20719265937805%\n   When  &#34;Impossible!&#34; was changed to  &#34;Totally feasible!&#34;, the contradiction score went from  0.073% to  99.5%, even though sentence  s1 is structured very differently.\n For more examples, check out the  repo and  colab notebook.
