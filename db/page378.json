"note_en": "A recent post by  Hillel Wayneabout influential dead languages (well, mostly dead, he notes) has reminded me that there is a lot about APL that people do not know, and with the obscurity of APL in the wide world of programming, one must be forgiven for thinking of APL in terms of a dead (mostly) language. But this question comes up so much that I think it is worthwhile to examine APL in this light and clarify the understanding of APL in the modern world. Let us examine this question in three parts:  ...\n  What makes for a dead language? In short, lack of life. But how does this apply to programming languages? The proxy measures of popularity and userbase can help us, because popular languages are never dead. The reason for this is that the languages with many developers and users are almost always evolving and inventing new features, code, and interfaces. They maintain their connection to modern devices and interfaces. Nonetheless, popularity is not everything. After all, Haskell spent years  ...\n Life is creation and movement and potential. A language dies when it ceases to provide value in these dimensions. In other words, when a language no longer has anything to contribute, when it is no longer suitable for creating new ideas, when it no longer keeps pace with the needs of the user, it dies.\n Languages that maintain usability while embedding unique or innovative models of thinking and problem solving are much more resilient to losses in popularity. Indeed, most new languages rise from obscurity precisely because of a unique combination of usability and newness/innovation in some way that matters. But languages like APL are a great example of how even great languages may lapse into obscurity due to market forces and failures to deliver value in the right niche. What is the maxim?  ...\n Often, a new language may die relatively quickly, as newness wears off and its essence is absorbed into other languages. The less fundamental uniqueness and value in a language, the faster a language can die. That&#39;s why we see so many languages that might be legacy still kicking in certain niches: their value is insanely high, or perceived to be so in those areas.\n  APL thrived in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s as an ultra-high productivity language for solving a problem rapidly and accurately. It gave access to the mainframes that others could not. Universities&#39; Computer Science departments actually found it too easy, and many departments embracing the software engineering model or formal methods model a la Dijkstra ran a heavy campaign against APL.\n During the 90&#39;s, the wave of Software Engineering, Personal Computers, and Object-oriented Programming (tm), swallowed up any alternatives. The APL vendors did not adequately respond and the fashion of the day meant that the user-focused, rapid development of APL became persona non grata in short order. The growing popularity of spreadsheets meant APL was fighting a two-front war and it lost ground (mindshare) quickly. Efforts such as J failed to achieve sufficient marketshare to turn  ...\n Despite this, APL continued to provide very high value to its existing customers, and Dyalog continued to invest not only in maintaining the language, but evolving and growing it to remain relevant and in many ways still ahead of the times (by about 20 years it seems). The result is a very solid language with some of the best tooling out there. The late great John Scholes introduced functional programming into the language at least a decade before anyone in mainstream programming (including  ...\n The willingness of the APL community to continue chasing what a &#34;tool of thought&#34; means in the fast-paced and practical world of business helped to insulate APL from too much fad programming. Ironically, it has also positioned APL in this decade to emerge like a phoenix from obscurity with a mature, fast, and experienced platform of tools and techniques for solving today&#39;s problems, because a few things happened while APL was &#34;away&#34; that changed the value proposition immensely.\n Not only has APL continued to evolve and improve over the years, the rest of the programming community has been learning lessons the hard way which only serve to make APL more relevant today than ever before.\n It turns out, OOP and software engineering are not the Godsends we thought them to be, particularly in the presence of rapid change. The compositional Lego block approach to programming has proven highly effective, both in functional programming as well as in the library-centric Python models. This was discussed years ago in MIT&#39;s famous shift away from its 6.001 curriculum of the day (decade?).\n We have also come to see the value of domain experts in the programming practice. Methods like the Agile Method and the like emphasize code and a close, efficient communication with the user of a system. The methods used in many APL shops have been using and mastering &#34;agile&#34; in very tough corporate conditions since long before it was a blip on the radar of &#34;hot&#34; terms. Not only is there a cohesive culture around it, APL is one of the only languages intentionally designed  ...\n We have also had some time to learn the pitfalls of super compilation and &#34;Super High-level Declarative Programming&#34; with the sometimes insane performance hits in these systems either in usability or runtime performance or, sometimes, both. A classic example is the now standard practice of in-memory data stores instead of using an RDBMS for everything. APL applications have been maximizing in-memory database systems and high-performance queries for decades now, and the out  ...\n In a post-Ruby on Rails, big data, data-driven world, it turns out that performance does matter, long term scalability matters, but productivity also matters a great deal. And for many, the lesson has been, you cannot have it all. But there is another element to this. In a world of Lego blocks, if you can be the block designer and builder, you have tremendous power and advantage compared to people who can only slap together the big blocks/components of others.\n When it comes to performance and productivity, no other general purpose language comes close nor has as many lessons in doing just that. This is because big picture performance gains matter most as long as you can manage the low-level performance. As I show in  my thesis, APL is uniquely capable of very high-level, direct solutions that are extremely concise, yet maintaining mechanical sympathy and near byte-level performance analysis. Because of changes in modern hardware, APL is  ...\n But what about those pesky symbols? Well, ask yourself what the trend in PL is these days. How many people embrace COBOL&#39;s keyword-heavy approach? We live in an international world full of non-English scripts. You know the closest thing to an international language we have? Math notation, and heavy on the symbols. APL is designed as executable math notation. Now that Unicode and modern fonts and operating systems make it possible to use and type any symbols we want, we need  ...\n Of course, it is not all sunshine and roses. The near death of APL in the 90&#39;s still weighs heavy on the community. Most users today are young enthusiasts or old greybeards, with precious little in the middle. It is still a small, albeit passionate (sometimes too passionate), community. Many of its users are simply not present in the Internet channels so precious and vital to the view of the world for many of us.\n Sometimes this is because they are under NDA&#39;s and cannot have a presence or talk about their work. Others simply have better things to do and would not bother. Still others may not love to share, but they do not stay connected with the broader community of programmers, because they are users of APL for their passion somewhere else, and they would not identify with the open-source Internet community of programming language polyglots.\n The end result is a severe iceberg effect for APL users that only compounds. Fortunately, things are looking up, with small user groups showing up throughout the world and places like the  APL Orchard providing a chance to hang out with a passionate subset of the community who enjoy helping new users.\n Still, APL is a small community no matter how you slice it, but do not let that deter you from joining it. APL&#39;s community is still largely human, so please reach out to someone at  Dyalog or  myself or  Adam at the APL Orchard with questions you may have and we can help answer your questions and point you to the right documentation.\n Is APL dead? Not anymore. Changes in modern hardware, business needs, development methods, and our understanding of programming makes APL in its modern state perhaps more relevant and viable than ever before.\n  Solutions in many programming domains are simple to express in direct APL without complex libraries and dependency hell.\n APL is mechanically sympathetic to modern GPU and CPU architectures, leading to fast code that does not need to be hard to read or write or port.\n Dyalog APL comes with extensive tooling, examples, documentation, integrations, visualization, debugging, ingest tools/functions, libraries, serialization, and platform support.\n Idiomatic APL admits automatic or near automatic complexity analysis and is performance predictable across many architectures.\n  APL idioms are often portable across domains, meaning that techniques and strategies you learn apply in more areas (versus a library approach that restricts how applicable a given function is).\n More concise APL enables reductions in boilerplate and a more holistic analysis of systems for better whole architecture optimization.\n  APL is a language designed from the ground up on principles aligned with &#34;agile&#34; styles of programming.\n APL programs can be fundamentally simpler and more transparent, leading to better understanding the problem and better solutions.\n APL enables the benefits of data flow, functional, Lego style programming without needing to resort to large and complex sets of black-box libraries that limit your freedom and understanding as well as restrict your cross-domain transfer.\n APL is particularly suited for innovative spaces where simply leveraging off the shelf solutions can lead to sub-optimal results, while APL can allow domain experts to iterate on novel and existing solutions together in a compositional way to address complex and even not-so-complex domains with aplomb.\n APL is easy to integrate into existing or new codebases through extensive integration support for REST, JSON, .NET, Python, C/C++, shared objects, TCP, CSV, Office, HTTP, Docker, COM, R, and many other interfaces.\n APL enables you to have a single codebase that is performance portable across both CPU and GPU architectures.\n Many more common tech stacks can be fully and directly implemented in pure APL without any libraries needs, such as high-performance in-memory database query systems; this results in less code and less complexity. Often, these direct expressions are as short or shorter than the library calls to the existing implementations.\n When it comes right down to it, APL offers a unique platform in Dyalog that can often deliver the trifecta of increased runtime performance and control while reducing long term maintenance costs and increasing developer productivity on the same codebase when compared to common platforms in vogue today. In my book, such a radically value-driven language is far from dead, it&#39;s back from a long hiatus and here to show the youngsters a thing or three.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 13:36:52", "tags":

"note_en": "(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (  BRKa.N) sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines in April, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company\u2019s annual meeting, saying \u201cthe world has changed\u201d for the aviation industry.\n  The conglomerate had held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines (  DAL.N), 10% of American Airlines Co (  AAL.O), 10% of Southwest Airlines Co (  LUV.N) and 9% of United Airlines (  UAL.O) at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings.\n The conglomerate was one of the largest individual holders in the four airlines and in 2016 disclosed it had begun investing in the four carriers after avoiding the sector for years.\n Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near collapse U.S. travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n U.S. airlines are cutting hundreds of thousands of flights, parking thousands of planes as U.S. travel demand has fallen by about 95% and there is no clear timetable for passengers to return to flights at pre-crisis levels.\n  \u201cWe made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cWe will not fund a company that \u2014 where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.\u201d\n Berkshire disclosed on April 3 it had sold about 18% of its Delta stake and 4% of its Southwest shares.\n Buffett said Berkshire had invested around $7 billion or $8 billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including American Airlines Group Inc (  AAL.O).\n \u201cWe did not take out anything like $7 or $8 billion and that was my mistake,\u201d Buffett said at the company\u2019s annual meeting which was livestreamed. \u201cI am the one who made the decision.\u201d\n  Delta said in a statement it was aware of the sale and has \u201ctremendous respect for Mr. Buffett and the Berkshire team.\u201d The airline added it remains \u201cconfident that the strengths that are core to Delta\u2019s business \u2013 our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability \u2013 will endure and position Delta to succeed.\u201d\n  \u201cIt is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up.... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,\u201d Buffett added.\n Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines. He did invest in USAir in 1989.\n \u201cIf a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down,\u201d Buffett wrote in his 2007 annual letter. \u201cInvestors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-05-03 13:14:18", "tags":

"note_en": "Modern webpages are complex, full-featured applications with really impressive designs, and there are a lot of people interested in learning to style these rich interfaces.\n The nice thing about the Web is that even if I\u2019m an inexperienced developer, it\u2019s really easy to stumble upon tons of interesting designs during my regular browsing sessions.\n And so let\u2019s say I come across this example from the Airbnb homepage, and I\u2019d like to replicate this booking form here.\n So one thing you can do is to search for tutorials on a websites like CSSTricks or Codrops.\n But it\u2019s often difficult to specify exactly what aspect of the design you\u2019d like a tutorial for.\n But the biggest problem is that tutorials are often  too simplistic and not exactly what we\u2019re looking for.\n Here\u2019s a toy example that I found when searching for tutorials. You can see right away that it doesn\u2019t quite match the aesthetics of the original, which is dissatisfying.\n The Airbnb example uses  display: table; to achieve a tabular layout without using a semantically-incorrect  &lt;table&gt; element.\n The toy example uses floats and clearfix, which is a pretty outdated approach to layout.\n Now experts know this, so they often use the \u201cInspect Element\u201d feature built into modern browser devtools to inspect the underlying implementation.\n how other webpages implement effects using modern development best practices that tutorials don\u2019t always convey.\n  what exactly novices find challenging about inspecting production webpage CSS, and what that implies for the design of inspection tools\n I\u2019ll walk you through Ply, the tool we built to address these challenges\n and demonstrate how it helped novices replicate a complex design 50% more quickly and learn new concepts\n Surveyed 20 undergrad web devs about their experiences learning web development, using tutorials, and inspecting professional examples\n Followed up with 10 of them for an in-person study, during which they replicated web features on professional webpages using CDT\n Novices rely on  visual intuition, but existing inspection tools do not support reasoning visually about unfamiliar code.\n In line with  Gross and Kelleher (2010),  Brandt et al. (2010),  Ko, Myers, and Aung (2004)\n Our high-level finding was that novices rely heavily on their visual intuition to comprehend unfamiliar CSS, and struggle to relate visual outcomes to responsible lines of code.\n This is consistent with prior work that end user programmers struggle to identify the lines of code responsible for graphical outputs of interest.\n In particular, I want to talk about two core obstacles we identified in the context of CSS inspection.\n  So first, if you\u2019ve used Chrome DevTools you probably know that you can click a property to toggle it on and off, live on the page.\n The problem is that even though Chrome crosses off properties that it knows are inactive, there are  still properties left that can be toggled without changing the page\u2019s appearance.\n This would be fine if it were only one or two, but tragically, there are a lot \u2013 the red highlights are properties that are visually ineffective but appear relevant in Chrome \u2013 and you can see that it\u2019s pushed the relevant properties in green to the bottom of the fold.\n As we observed in needfinding, when relevant code was pushed below the fold, it was hard for novices to find\n But even if you removed these it\u2019s not enough \u2013 we also found in needfinding that novices lacked conceptual knowledge that prevented them from making sense of unfamiliar example code.\n In particular, novices struggled to understand how multiple properties work together to produce visual outcomes.\n one thing that people struggled with is understanding when multiple properties worked together to produce a visual effect\n So what we\u2019re seeing is that there\u2019s a gap between novices\u2019 approach to sense-making and how developer tools are currently designed.\n   So we build on their guidelines to propose new design guidelines for learner-friendly web inspectors.\n  Hide visually-irrelevant code from inspector output to minimize information overload and support novices\u2019 visual approach to sense-making\n Embed contextual guidance into inspector output to explain how CSS properties coordinate to produce visual effects.\n   Use representations and language that bridge learners\u2019 understanding (which in our case is visual intuition)\n           Our approach is inspired by a technique called visual regression testing, which is unrelated to statistical regression.\n     This seems like simple visual comparisons, but it allows us to help a novice understand the example by surfacing the conceptual knowledge about relationships between properties that they didn\u2019t know beforehand.\n      Following standard measures of learning gain, we asked participants to perform a similar task before and after performing the intervention so we could track the change in their understanding.\n  \u201cSomething about  z-index would change as a result of  position not being fixed.  position: fixed; is  doing something beyond pinning in place while you scroll.\u201d\n TODO: What\u2019s more exciting is that they could explain why this was happening", "posttime": "2020-05-03 12:08:24", "tags":

"note_en": "Streams were first introduced with Java 8 in 2014. So, they&#39;re around 5 years old now. However, many of us still struggle to understand &amp; explain Streams properly. For some, it is just a new way to loop through a list while some think it just reduces the amount of code that we need to write. Although these statements are not incorrect they highly understate the power of Streams. Today we will learn Streams with a couple of things that you all can find in your kitchen i.e a tap, some water,  ...\n  Turn that tap on and the water starts flowing. People, you have a stream and that water is your data. Streams are all about data being pushed to you. Instead of you going to the data (like pulling out water in a bucket from a well) the data itself comes to you. To keep a track of things technically, we will also work with a Stream of Strings which will represent our water stream in code.\n // a stream of string to represent our water stream with some impurities in it.Stream&lt;String&gt; water = Stream.of( &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;);  // water, water, water, impurity, impurity, water\n  Water from the tap is not considered good to be consumed directly because of impurities just like sometimes we don&#39;t want something to be a part of our data. And, here is when a filter (something like a water purifier) comes in to remove anything that we don&#39;t want.\n Stream&lt;String&gt; water = Stream.of( &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;);  // water, water, water, impurity, impurity, water // let&#39;s filter out impuritiesStream&lt;String&gt; pureWater = water.filter(w -&gt; !w.equals( &#34;impurity&#34;));  // water, water, water, water\n  We are delicate beings and removing impurities from water is just not enough for us. We also need the water to be injected with RO &amp; other minerals, right? In real life generally, our water purifiers do all these things but for the sake of our example here we will take it as a different operation, a  map operation.\n Stream&lt;String&gt; water = Stream.of( &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;);Stream&lt;String&gt; pureWater = water.filter(w -&gt; !w.equals( &#34;impurity&#34;));  // water, water, water, water // let&#39;s add some ro &amp; mineralsStream&lt;String&gt; roWater = pureWater.map(w -&gt;  &#34;ro&#34; + w);  // rowater, rowater, rowater, rowater\n A very important thing to keep in mind here is that  map is a  1 to 1 operation. A  1 to 1 operation means one input produces one output. For eg: here every single  water is being converted to a single  rowater\n  What happens when you pass water through a sprinkler? Yes, it&#39;s broken down into droplets. And, that&#39;s exactly what a  flatMap does to your data.\n Unlike the  map it is a  1 to many operation i.e it produces multiple outputs for a single input.\n Stream&lt;String&gt; water = Stream.of( &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;);Stream&lt;String&gt; pureWater = water.filter(w -&gt; !w.equals( &#34;impurity&#34;));  // water, water, water, waterStream&lt;Character&gt; droplets = pureWater.flatMap(w -&gt; w.chars().mapToObj(d -&gt; ( char) d));  // waterwaterwaterwater\n  Now, think about it. Would you turn that tap on, that water purifier on or that sprinkler on, unless &amp; until you need water to store, to cook or to drink? No, right. It does not make sense to do this whole process if you do not have a concrete purpose. That&#39;s exactly what Java thinks and thus it chose to keep the Streams lazy. All the code that you see above would do nothing unless you have a specific purpose, something that we call a  terminal operation.\n  In our whole kitchen, tap, water scenario what do you think would be the terminal operation? Collecting the water to a glass (remember, I mentioned that you would need a glass as well). So, unless you want a glass of water you wouldn&#39;t turn on anything.\n Unlike  map,  flatMap &amp;  filter there is no operation named  terminal. However, various operations like  collect,  forEach etc. are considered to be terminal operations.\n Stream&lt;String&gt; water = Stream.of( &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;);Stream&lt;String&gt; pureWater = water.filter(w -&gt; !w.equals( &#34;impurity&#34;));  // water, water, water, waterStream&lt;String&gt; roWater = pureWater.map(w -&gt;  &#34;ro&#34; + w);  // rowater, rowater, rowater, rowaterList&lt;String&gt; glassOfWater = roWater.collect(Collectors.toList());  // a terminal operation which will kick off  ...\n In the code above, the Streams  water,  pureWater &amp;  roWater will be executed only when the line\n  gets executed because that&#39;s our terminal operation, that&#39;s our concrete purpose to even have all those streams in the first place.\n  Doing something like below is absolutely fine and even recommended. After all, your kitchen also has things attached as well, right.\n List&lt;String&gt; glassOfWater = Stream .of( &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;impurity&#34;,  &#34;water&#34;)  // water, water, water, impurity, impurity, water .filter(w -&gt; !w.equals( &#34;impurity&#34;))  // water, water, water, water .map(w -&gt;  &#34;ro&#34; + w)  // rowater, rowater, rowater, rowater .collect(Collectors.toList());  // list of rowater, rowater, rowater, rowater\n  Now, that&#39;s what Streams are in all their glory. They are a lot more powerful than you think and I hope after this post you&#39;ll appreciate Streams more than just considering them as a new iterator or boilerplate remover.", "posttime": "2020-05-03

I have identified several critical vulnerabilities during the research, all of which have been reported to the affected vendors.\n  In these unprecedented times, more and more people are escaping into the digital world to cope with social distancing. During these times cyber-security is more important than ever. From my limited experience, very few startups are mindful of security best practices. The companies responsible for a large range of dating apps are no exception. I started this little research project to see how secure the latest dating apps are.\n  All high severity vulnerabilities disclosed in this post have been reported to the vendors. By the time of publishing, corresponding patches have been released, and I have independently verified that the fixes are in place.\n     Coffee Meets Bagel or CMB for short, launched in 2012, is known for showing users a limited number of matches every day. They have been hacked once in 2019, with 6 million accounts stolen. Leaked information included a full name, email address, age, registration date, and gender. CMB has been gaining popularity in recent years, and makes a good candidate for this project.\n  The tagline for  The League app is \u201cdate intelligently\u201d. Launched some time in 2015, it is a members-only app, with acceptance and matches based on LinkedIn and Facebook profiles. The app is more expensive and selective than its alternatives, but is security on par with the price?\n  I use a combination of static analysis and dynamic analysis for reverse engineering. For static analysis I decompile the APK, mostly using  apktool and  jadx. For dynamic analysis I use an MITM network proxy with SSL proxy capabilities.\n The majority of the testing is done inside a rooted Android emulator running Android 8 Oreo. Tests that require more capabilities are done on a real Android device running Lineage OS 16 (based on Android Pie), rooted with Magisk.\n  Both apps have a lot of trackers and telemetry, but I guess that is just the state of the industry. CMB has more trackers than  The League though.\n  The API includes a  pair_action field in every  bagel object and it is an enum with the following values:\n  There exists an API that given a bagel ID returns the bagel object. The bagel ID is shown in the batch of daily bagels. So if you want to see if someone has rejected you, you could try the following:\n After the call to get daily suggested bagels, save the bagel ID of someone you liked.\n This is a harmless vulnerability, but it is funny that this field is exposed through the API but is not available through the app.\n  CMB shows other users\u2019 longitude and latitude up to 2 decimal places, which is around 1 square mile. Fortunately this information  is not real-time, and it is only updated when a user chooses to update their location. (I imagine this must be used by the app for matchmaking purposes. I have not verified this hypothesis.)\n     The app sends a POST request with the phone number, the OTP, and a  bearer value, which is a 16 byte UUID.\n Server receives the request, and if the OTP matches the phone number, the  bearer becomes user\u2019s login token.\n From this point, subsequent requests to endpoints that require authentication would include the header  authorization: bearer sms:{the_uuid}\n The UUID that becomes the  bearer is entirely client-side generated. Worse, the server did not verify that the  bearer value is an actual valid UUID. It might cause collisions and other problems.\n I recommend changing the login model so the bearer token is generated server-side and sent to the client once the server receives the correct OTP from the client.\n  In  The League there exists an unauthenticated API that accepts a phone number as query parameter. The API leaks information in HTTP response code. When the phone number is registered, it returns  200 OK, but when the number is not registered, it returns  418 I&#39;m a teapot. It could be abused in a few ways, e.g. mapping all the numbers under an area code to see who is on  The Leagueand who is not. Or it can lead to potential embarrassment when your coworker finds out you are on the  ...\n This has since been fixed when the bug was reported to the vendor. Now the API simply returns 200 for all requests.\n  The League integrates with LinkedIn to show a user\u2019s employer and job title on their profile. Sometimes it goes a bit overboard gathering information. The profile API returns detailed job position information scraped from LinkedIn, like the start year, end year, etc.\n  While the app does ask user permission to read LinkedIn profile, the user probably does not expect the detailed position information to be included in their profile for everyone else to view. I do not think that kind of information is necessary for the app to function, and it can probably be excluded from profile data.\n  Typically for pictures or other asserts, some type of Access Control List (ACL) would be in place. For assets such as profile pictures, a common way of implementing ALC would be:\n Server puts the URL to the image with the key in user\u2019s profile\n The key would serve as a \u201cpassword\u201d to access the file, and the password would only be given users who need access to the image. In the case of a dating app, it will be whoever the profile is presented to.\n I have identified several misconfigured S3 buckets on  The League during the research.  All pictures and videos are accidentally made public, with metadata such as which user uploaded them and when. Normally the app would get the images through Cloudfront, a CDN on top of the S3 buckets. Unfortunately the underlying S3 buckets are severely misconfigured.\n The photo and video buckets are unauthenticated and  even allow ListObjects. The keys in the bucket are in the format  {profile_uuid}-{timestamp}-{filename}, so there is plenty of abuse potential. For one, a competitor can dump the keys and find out the exact number of users on the app. Or an attacker can see all the photos uploaded by a victim once the profile UUID is known.\n Side note: As far as I can tell, the profile UUID are randomly generated server-side when the profile is created. So that part is unlikely to be so easy to guess. The filename is controlled by the client; the server accepts any filename, however the in the client app it is hardcoded to  upload.jpg.\n The vendor has since disabled public ListObjects. However, I still think there should be some randomness in the key. A timestamp cannot serve as secret.\n  Link preview is one thing that is hard to get right in a lot of messaging apps. There are typically three strategies for link previews:\n Sender-side link previews When a message is composed, the link preview is generated under the sender\u2019s context.\n Recipient-side link previews Note that this method could leak some context about the recipient, such as the IP address, user agent, and other headers.\n Server-side link previews Server can fetch the link for preview either on message sent, or when message is opened.\n An attacker controlled external server could return a different response if the request comes from the link preview server, thus sending a fake preview to recipient.\n The League uses  recipient-side link previews. When a message includes a link to an external image, the link is fetched on user\u2019s device when the message is viewed. This would effectively allow a malicious sender to send an external image URL pointing to an attacker controlled server, obtaining recipient\u2019s IP address when the message is opened.\n A better solution might be just to attach the image in the message when it is sent (sender-side preview), or have the server fetch the image and put it in the message (server-side preview). Server-side previews will allow additional anti-abuse scanning. It might be a better option, but still not bulletproof.\n  The app will sometimes attach the authorization header to requests that do not require authentication, such as Cloudfront GET requests. It will also gladly give out the bearer token in requests to  external domains in some cases.\n One of those cases is the external image link in chat messages. We already know the app uses recipient-side link previews, and the request to the external resource is executed in recipient \u2019s context. The authorization header is included in the GET request to the external image URL. So the bearer token gets leaked to the external domain. When a malicious sender sends a image link pointing to an attacker controlled server, not only do they get recipient \u2019s IP, they  ...\n Note that unlike phishing, this attack  does not require the victim to click on the link. When the message containing the image link is viewed, the app automatically leaks the session token to the attacker.\n It seems to be a bug related to the reuse of a global OkHttp client object. It would be best if the developers make sure the app only attaches authorization bearer header in requests to  The League API.\n  I did not find any particular interesting vulnerabilities in CMB, but that does not mean CMB is more secure than  The League. (See  Limitations and future research). I did find a few security issues in  The League, none of which were particularly difficult to discover or exploit. I guess it really is the common mistakes people make over and over. OWASP top ten anyone?\n As consumers we need to be mindful with which companies we trust with our data.\n  I did receive a prompt response from  The League after sending them an email alerting them of the findings.\n I think startups could certainly offer bug bounties. It is a nice gesture, and more importantly, platforms like HackerOne provide researchers a legal path to the disclosure of vulnerabilities. Unfortunately neither of the two apps in the post has such program.\n  This research is not comprehensive, and  should not be seen as a security audit. Most of the tests in this post were done on the network IO level, and very little on the client itself. Notably, I did not test for remote code execution or buffer overflow type vulnerabilities. In future research, we could look more into the security of the client applications.\n   Static analysis would also be possible, I could try fuzzers or automated scanning tools. However it might not be so simple if the APKs are ProGuard-obfuscated.\n   David Siu, VP of Engineering at  The League, for the quick turnaround when the vulnerabilities were reported.", "posttime":

"note_en": "A Czech politician in hiding amid allegations of a Russian assassination plot says he believes the threat against him is credible and he fears for his life.\n Three Prague politicians are under 24-hour police guard because of the alleged plot to poison them - claims categorically denied by Moscow.\n &#34;It&#39;s very difficult,&#34; said Ondrej Kolar, mayor of Prague&#39;s sixth district, speaking to the BBC from an undisclosed location under heavy police guard.\n &#34;I haven&#39;t seen my children for quite a long time, and they haven&#39;t seen me. Even my family doesn&#39;t know where I am,&#34; he told me via Skype, now his only means of communication with the outside world.\n I vaguely know Mr Kolar. We both once worked at New York University in Prague.\n  His bright blue cardboard backdrop, with the words &#34;Prague 6 Municipal District&#34;, looked familiar. Then I remembered.\n The last time we met was shortly before a vote at Prague 6 district council to move the bronze statue of Soviet Marshal Ivan Konev. That World War Two commander was many things, but historians agree he was not, as the plinth once claimed, the &#34;liberator of Prague&#34;.\n The statue was erected in 1980, but Konev was a controversial figure who oversaw the Soviets&#39; brutal suppression of the 1956 Hungarian Uprising and helped crush the Prague Spring of 1968.\n  The Russian government has reacted angrily to the monument&#39;s removal and has even threatened legal action.\n Mayor Kolar was leading the council meeting and I had to wait. I sat in an antechamber - under a large, bright blue screen. He had apparently taken the screen to his undisclosed hiding place.\n &#34;There are things I cannot comment on. But what I can say is that both the Czech police and the secret service do have some intel that there might be a threat directly from the Russian side,&#34; he told me.\n   The nature of that threat, first elucidated in a brief but explosive piece in the investigative Czech weekly Respekt, is straight out of a spy novel.\n Three weeks ago, claimed the publication, citing unnamed intelligence sources, a man travelling on a Russian diplomatic passport arrived at Prague airport carrying a suitcase containing the deadly poison ricin.\n According to the report, he was picked up by a car bearing Russian diplomatic plates and taken to the Russian embassy, not far from Ondrej Kolar&#39;s office in Prague 6.\n Czech intelligence services, Respekt claimed, deemed the man to be a direct threat to two city politicians who had angered Moscow in recent months: Ondrej Kolar, and Zdenek Hrib, the capital&#39;s mayor.\n Mr Hrib recently oversaw the renaming of the area in front of the Russian embassy as Boris Nemtsov Square, honouring a prominent opponent of President Vladimir Putin murdered in 2015.\n  The following day another publication, Denik N, claimed a third critic of Moscow - local mayor Pavel Novotny - was also receiving police protection.\n   The denials from Russia were swift and unequivocal. The report, said the embassy, had &#34;absolutely no basis&#34;. Mr Putin&#39;s spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the news report as &#34;fake&#34;.\n  A foreign ministry spokeswoman told the BBC they would &#34;not comment on the leaks published in the media&#34;, although she did confirm that an accredited Russian diplomat had arrived at the airport, presumably on one of the few flights still running during the coronavirus lockdown.\n As the jaw-dropping allegations flashed around the world, prompting a mixture of outrage, disbelief and ridicule, journalists and diplomats began working their phones. There was - there is - persistent scepticism, including amongst seasoned Russia-watchers.\n  Assassinating the mayor of a European capital would be tantamount to an act of war. It would be so counter-productive to the Kremlin it would be simply insane.\n  From a source within Czech counter-intelligence, there was\u2026 not confirmation exactly. But far from a denial. The media reports, the source told me, were grounded in factual information.\n  &#34;We know what happened in the past with the Russian secret service and its agents trying to poison Mr Skripal with a nerve agent,&#34; he told the BBC.\n  Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned in Salisbury in 2018, by agents thought to have been sent by Russian intelligence.\n &#34;When they have the guts to do this in the United Kingdom, why not do it in Prague?&#34;", "posttime": "2020-05-03 11:46:01", "tags": "\u9634\u8c0b,poison,\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af,russian", "title":

"note_en": "On 27 August 1883, the Earth let out a noise louder than any it has made since.\n It was 10:02 AM local time when the sound emerged from the island of Krakatoa, which sits between Java and Sumatra in Indonesia. It was heard 1,300 miles away in the Andaman and Nicobar islands ( \u201cextraordinary sounds were heard, as of guns firing \u201d); 2,000 miles away in New Guinea and Western Australia ( \u201ca series of loud reports, resembling those of artillery in a north-westerly direction \u201d); and even 3,000 miles away in the Indian Ocean island of Rodrigues, near Mauritius* ( \u201ccoming from  ...\n Think, for a moment, just how crazy this is. If you \u2019re in Boston and someone tells you that they heard a sound coming from New York City, you \u2019re probably going to give them a funny look. But Boston is a mere 200 miles from New York. What we \u2019re talking about here is like being in Boston and clearly hearing a noise coming from Dublin, Ireland. Travelling at the speed of sound (766 miles or 1,233 kilometers per hour), it takes a noise about 4 hours to cover that distance. This is the most  ...\n So what could possibly create such an earth-shatteringly loud bang? A volcano on Krakatoa had just erupted with a force so great that it  tore the island  apart, emitting a plume of smoke that reached 17 miles into the atmosphere, according to a geologist who witnessed it 1. You could use this observation to  calculate that  stuff spewed out of the volcano at over 1,600 miles per hour\u2014or nearly half a mile per second. That\u2019s more than twice the speed of sound.\n This explosion created a deadly tsunami with waves over a hundred feet (30 meters) in height. One hundred sixty-five coastal villages and settlements were swept away and entirely destroyed. In all, the Dutch (the colonial rulers of Indonesia at the time) estimated the death toll at 36,417, while other estimates exceed 120,000 2,3.\n The British ship Norham Castle was 40 miles from Krakatoa at the time of the explosion. The ship\u2019s captain wrote in his log, \u201cSo violent are the explosions that the ear-drums of over half my crew have been shattered. My last thoughts are with my dear wife. I am convinced that the Day of Judgement has come.\u201d 2\n  In general, sounds are caused not by the end of the world but by fluctuations in air pressure. A barometer at the Batavia gasworks (100 miles away from Krakatoa) registered the ensuing spike in pressure at over 2.5 inches of mercury 1,2 . That converts to over 172 decibels of sound pressure, an unimaginably loud noise. To put that in context, if you were operating a jackhammer you \u2019d be subject to about 100 decibels. The human threshold for pain is near 130 decibels, and if you had the  ...\n When you hum a note or speak a word, you \u2019re wiggling air molecules back and forth dozens or hundreds of times per second, causing the air pressure to be low in some places and high in other places. The louder the sound, the more intense these wiggles, and the larger the fluctuations in air pressure. But there \u2019s a limit to how loud a sound can get. At some point, the fluctuations in air pressure are so large that the low pressure regions hit zero pressure \u2014a vacuum \u2014and you can \u2019t get  ...\n Closer to Krakatoa, the sound was well over this limit, producing a blast of high pressure air so powerful that it ruptured the eardrums of sailors 40 miles away. As this sound travelled thousands of miles, reaching Australia and the Indian Ocean, the wiggles in pressure started to die down, sounding more like a distant gunshot. Over 3,000 miles into its journey, the wave of pressure grew too quiet for human ears to hear, but it continued to sweep onward, reverberating for days across  ...\n  By 1883, weather stations in scores of cities across the world were using barometers to track changes in atmospheric pressure. Six hours and 47 minutes after the Krakatoa explosion, a spike of air pressure was detected in Calcutta. By 8 hours, the pulse reached Mauritius in the west and Melbourne and Sydney in the east. By 12 hours, St. Petersburg noticed the pulse, followed by Vienna, Rome, Paris, Berlin, and Munich. By 18 hours the pulse had reached New York, Washington DC, and Toronto  ...\n In all, the pressure waves from Krakatoa circled the globe three to four times in each direction. (Each city felt up to seven pressure spikes because they experienced shock waves travelling in opposite directions from the volcano 1.) Meanwhile, tidal stations as far away as India, England, and San Francisco measured a rise in ocean waves simultaneous with this air pulse, an effect that had never been seen before. It was a sound that could no longer be heard but that continued moving  ...\n Recently, an incredible home video of a volcanic eruption taken by a couple on vacation in Papua New Guinea started making the rounds on the Internet. If you watch closely, this video gives you a sense for the pressure wave created by a volcano.\n  When the volcano erupts, it produces a sudden spike in air pressure; you can actually watch as it moves through the air, condensing water vapor into clouds as it travels. The people taking the video are (fortunately) far enough away that pressure wave takes a while to reach them. When it does finally hit the boat, some 13 seconds after the explosion, you hear what sounds like a huge gunshot accompanied by a sudden blast of air. Multiplying 13 seconds by the speed of sound tells us  ...\n   [1] Judd, John Wesley, et al.  The Eruption of Krakatoa: And Subsequent Phenomena . Tr\u00fcbner &amp; Company, 1888.

"note_en": "A year to the day since the arrival of Textpattern 4.7.3, Team Textpattern is proud to announce the release of Textpattern  CMS 4.8.0, available for immediate  download.\n Although Textpattern 4.8.0 is a  minor release in terms of its version number, over 800 changes have been made to Textpattern\u2019s code to add new functionality, enhance existing features, resolve some issues from previous Textpattern releases and lay more foundations for extending the capabilities of Textpattern in future.\n Textpattern\u2019s no-nonsense tag system has received some impressive improvements and new arrivals. We\u2019ll tell you more about these changes in blog posts, including examples of how our users are harnessing the power of Textpattern to achieve amazing things, so please stay tuned.\n An integral part of the Textpattern ecosystem is our user community. The value and strength of developers, administrators, designers, and end users working together to build on Textpattern is incalculable. Whether it\u2019s help with troubleshooting, advice &amp; feedback, translating, or elegant code poetry that deserves to be shared, it\u2019s the power of community behind Textpattern that drives it forward.\n Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release with code for new functionality, reporting &amp; resolving bugs, providing &amp; improving  language translations and overall improvements to the code, documentation and the wealth of information in the Textpattern ecosystem. We\u2019re grateful to everyone who continues to help with their expertise, time, attention, words, signal boosting, evangelism and other activities.\n  You can download Textpattern from textpattern.com using the following links, or from  the GitHub repository directly. Please take a moment to \u2018star\u2019  Textpattern\u2019s repositories on GitHub.\n Whether you download from textpattern.com or GitHub, the respective file contents are identical. To take full advantage of Textpattern\u2019s  multi-site capabilities, please download the  .tar.gz archive as it includes the multi-site scaffold.\n     The  Textpattern demo has been updated to offer Textpattern 4.8.0 test drives in complete safety. The demo sites are rebuilt every few hours using the Textpattern auto-installer.\n  Textpattern 4.8 requires a  minimum of  PHP 5.5 as part of the  system requirements, though a vendor-supported  PHP version is  highly recommended ( PHP 7.3 and  PHP 7.4 have active and ongoing support at the time of writing).\n It also requires the SimpleXML extension to be installed. Most servers have this built in already so you should be good to go with your host\u2019s  PHP.\n  As with any Textpattern release, please ensure you log out of the admin side prior to upgrade, perform and verify a full site backup (database and files, including any uploads), and refer to the  README.txt file in the download archives for detailed instructions.\n  The  Textpattern 4.8.0  HISTORY.txt outlines changes for this and previous Textpattern releases. We recommend you read the list of changes to understand how this may affect your current site, especially if you\u2019re upgrading from older versions.\n If you require clarification on any aspect of the release notes, we recommend you seek advice  before starting a site upgrade. The  Textpattern support forum is an excellent place to start, and the  Textpattern user documentation is regularly updated with examples, explanations and background information.\n     Changed: Non-searchable sections can be omitted from  &lt;txp:section_list&gt; output with valueless \u2018exclude\u2019 attribute.\n                    Added: \u2018pg\u2019, \u2018total\u2019 and \u2018limit\u2019 attributes to  &lt;txp:newer /&gt; and  &lt;txp:older /&gt; tags.\n      Added: Global \u2018evaluate\u2019, \u2018replace\u2019 and \u2018yield\u2019 attributes. Evaluate can execute contained content in arbitrary order.\n    Fixed:  &lt;txp:category_list&gt; \u2018sort\u2019 attribute respects \u2018categories\u2019 attribute instead of requiring sort=\u201d\u201c override.\n      Option to disable auto-expanding text areas in Hive admin themes via  config.php file.

"note_en": "IKEA\u2019s latest release takes going green to a whole new level. In fact, the new product design allows for users to grow food for an entire block or neighborhood, depending on population.\n Available online for free download, the blueprints are intended for the assembly of an urban structure used to grow produces that normally can only be grown in rural areas.\n The Growroom, which originated as part of an architectural competition, provides urban residents the ability to grow their own food in sustainable and natural ways, without having to purchase a large section of land.\n The official structure is designed by Sine Lindholm and Mads-Ulrik Husumtoin, architects who are part of Space 10, IKEA\u2019s innovative idea lab. It can be built with as little as plywood, screws, a hammer and access to a local fab lab, which experts stress are very common these days.\n Although not everyone utilizes these resources daily or even monthly, recent technological advancements have allowed for the nearly every major city to serve as a host for at least one set of 3-D printing and laser cutting tools.\n \u201cThis means most people\u200a\u2014\u200ain theory\u200a\u2014\u200acould produce almost anything themselves,\u201d, IKEA offered in a press release. \u201cJust as printers are now ubiquitous; local and on-demand, customized production could become the norm of the future. We\u2019re tapping into this emerging potential by releasing the cutting files for The Growroom.\u201d\n   \u201cLocal food represents a serious alternative to the global food model. It reduces food miles, our pressure on the environment, and educates our children of where food actually comes from. The result on the dining table is just as fascinating.\u201d\n For individuals concerned about their health or who experience severe food allergies or intolerances, the option to grow one\u2019s own produce in bulk could significantly improve their quality of living.\n Additionally, home food growth reduces pressure on the environment and educates consumers, especially children on where their food actually comes from. Subsequently, the food produced is a higher quality, and therefore is more nutrient rich, fresh, and organic. It typically even tastes better.\n Most importantly, structures like The Growroom will help meet the demand for increased food as the population continues to grow.\n How It Works At 2.8 x 2.5 meters, The Growroom is designed so the average individual urban homeowner can assemble and care for it. The cost of materials used was also taken into consideration, as to develop the most affordable product possible.\n Overlapping layers make it so the structure receives light and water on each of its levels.\n SPACE10 envision a future, where we grow our own food much more locally. To spark conversations about how we can bring nature back into our cities.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 10:39:34", "tags": "\u53d1\u5e03,\u514d\u8d39,\u5b9c\u5bb6,\u8bbe\u8ba1,releases", "title":

"note_en": "A group of researchers at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak won&#39;t end until 60% to 70% of the human population  is immune to the virus, which may take between 18 and 24 months.\n The experts laid out three scenarios for how the  coronavirus pandemic will progress. The worst-case scenario among these three projections involves a second, larger wave of infections this fall and winter. The report authors suggest this is the most likely outcome, and states need to prepare for it.\n &#34;This thing&#39;s not going to stop until it infects 60 to 70% of people,&#34; Michael Osterholm, report author and the director of CIDRAP,  told CNN. &#34;The idea that this is going to be done soon defies microbiology.&#34;\n     Osterholm and his colleagues examined multiple  models that predict future coronavirus impacts, research about how well COVID-19 spreads between people, and data from past pandemics to reach their conclusions.\n The coronavirus outbreak shares important similarities to a pandemic influenza, like the 1918 Spanish flu (which killed 500 million people worldwide), which makes this type of flu a solid model for comparison.\n Both a pandemic influenza and the COVID-19 virus spread via droplets we emit when coughing or sneezing and can pass between infected people showing no symptoms \u2014 known as  asymptomatic carriers. But even though pandemic influenza may be a good model to try and predict how the COVID-19 will outbreak will play out, experts still aren&#39;t sure what to expect.\n That&#39;s because the coronavirus spreads even more easily than the flu does; an average person with the coronavirus infects between 2 and 2.5 new people: a metric known as the virus&#39;  R0 value. Seasonal influenza&#39;s Ro value is  about 1.3.\n   &#34;There is no crystal ball to tell us what the future holds and what the &#39;end game&#39; for controlling this pandemic will be,&#34; the report authors wrote.\n That&#39;s why Osterholm&#39;s group came up with three possible scenarios about what might be coming after this first wave of coronavirus infections ends.\n    In this projection, the first COVID-19 waves is followed by a series of repetitive, smaller waves that occur through the summer. Those waves, which come with a lower number of infections with persist over a one- to two-year period, gradually diminishing sometime in 2021.\n The authors noted that where those smaller waves occur could depend on what measures certain geographic areas have in place to  &#34;flatten the curve,&#34; including social distancing and non-essential business closures, and how those measures are rolled back.\n     The worst of the three scenarios, and the most likely, is one in which the first wave is followed by a larger wave in the fall or winter of 2020, and one or more smaller subsequent waves in 2021.\n This mirrors what happened  during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 flu.\n A second wave with more infections would require the US and other countries to reinstitute mitigation measures, like lockdowns, the authors wrote.\n      The final scenario suggests that this first wave of coronavirus infections is the only wave. In the coming months, the COVID-19 pandemic would shift into a &#34;slow burn&#34; of ongoing transmission and new cases.\n &#34;While this third pattern was not seen with past influenza pandemics, it remains a possibility for COVID-19,&#34; the experts reported.\n This possibility would mean US states likely wouldn&#39;t need to lockdown again, although cases and deaths would continue to occur.\n    But any help a vaccine could provide during the pandemic will be a long time coming, the report authors said. The earliest a vaccine is expected  is 2021.\n &#34;And we don&#39;t know what kinds of challenges could arise during vaccine development that could delay the timeline,&#34; they added.", "posttime": "2020-05-03 10:17:05", "tags": "coronavirus,\u75c5\u6bd2,\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2,\u53ef\u80fd,pandemic", "title": "\u7814\u7a76\u79f0\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u4e24\u5e74\u5e76\u5728\u79cb\u5b63\u6b7b\u7070\u590d\u71c3", "title_en": "Coronavirus pandemic may last 2 years and resurge in fall, study says", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-pandemic-could-last-2-years-resurge-in-fall-2020-5", "via": "", "source_name": "Hacker News", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u53ef\u80fd", "pandemic"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1000438, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u51e0\u5e74\u524d\uff0c\u6211\u8ba1\u5212\u505a\u4e00\u6b21\u6f14\u8bb2\uff0c\u4e3b\u9898\u662f\u63a2\u7d22Clojure\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u57cb\u85cf\u7740\u7684\u6587\u7269\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6211\u904d\u5386\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u4ea4\uff0c\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\u786e\u5b9e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u6211\u5bf9\u6f14\u8bb2\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\u6d88\u6563\u4e86\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u6700\u8fd1\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u7b14\u8bb0\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u6ca1\u6709\u8ba9\u5b83\u4eec\u6c38\u8fdc\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u4e0b\u9762\u539f\u5c01\u4e0d\u52a8\u5730\u5c55\u793a\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u8bf7\u539f\u8c05\u6211\u5199\u5f97\u4e0d\u597d\u3002", "note_en": "Years ago I planned to give a talk centered around exploring the Clojure source history to find interesting buried artifacts.

"note_en": "On a typical day, we interact with somewhere between 11 and 16 casual acquaintances \u2014for example, the barista we see every morning or the colleague we greet in the hallway. During the Covid-19 pandemic, with many of us practicing physical distancing, these once-common interactions have disappeared, and our social ties have been limited to more formal, scheduled \u2014and often exhausting \u2014check-ins with family and close friends. The authors offer suggestions on how to repurpose the informality  ...\n  The iPhone on the table buzzed. Ashley sighed. After three weeks of putting out fires while working through feelings of  grief and  stress, her first thought was, \u201cNow what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n  Except, this text message wasn\u2019t from an anxious client or student. Instead, a casual acquaintance had written: \u201cAshley, how are you? I\u2019ve been thinking about you and your partner in this Covid-19 environment. I hope you are both okay!\u201d Ashley\u2019s eyes welled up. She needed that check-in more than she realized. And, it was a nice surprise to hear from a colleague she hadn\u2019t caught up with for a while.\n  Perhaps there is something to be learned from this out-of-the-blue text message from an acquaintance. Can quick, informal check-ins provide a means to satisfy our need for social connection without turning socializing into a chore during this emotionally exhausting time?\n    A growing body of research suggests that there are surprisingly powerful benefits to connecting with casual acquaintances \u2014 relationships that sociologists call \u201cweak ties.\u201d\n  Gillian started studying weak ties after realizing how good it felt to be recognized by the owner of the hot dog stand that she passed on her way to campus each day, or to have Barry, the local pet store owner, ask about her cat by name.  Her research finds that people are happier on days when they say \u201chi\u201d to a colleague in the hallway or have a brief conversation with a neighbor at the grocery store. In  another of Gillian\u2019s studies, people who were asked to \u201cpersonalize  ...\n         To be sure, our friends and family \u2014 our strong ties \u2014 support us when we\u2019re feeling down and make us feel appreciated. But weak ties can do these things too: It\u2019s not just in the movies that people get social support from their hairdresser. We feel seen when a server smiles upon seeing us and knows what our \u201cusual\u201d is. In fact, our interactions with weak ties tend to go  especially smoothly, since we are often  on our best behaviorwith people we don \u2019t know  ...\n    In a normal day, people interact with somewhere between  11 and 16 weak ties on the way to work, while running errands, or on a break between meetings at the office.\n  Due to physical distancing, these once-common interactions have been eradicated, and we no longer have physical reminders that we are part of a wider social network.  Forty-five states have issued some variation of a stay-at-home order. When we do venture out for essential supplies or to take a walk, we see faces that are half hidden behind masks, and we most definitely are not allowed to interact. In countries like Italy, you can face  jail timefor these  ...\n  Since weak-tie interactions aren\u2019t happening spontaneously, we need to initiate them instead. However, we aren\u2019t used to doing this, so it may feel a little awkward. In fact, even before Covid-19, it was not our natural inclination to reach out to weak ties. This is because we aren\u2019t sure if the other person will be interested, and we worry that these conversations will be uncomfortable. Luckily, these fears are unfounded. When people  are assignedto  ...\n  So, how can we overcome our overblown fears and cultivate positive, informal interactions with weak ties? Here are five scientifically based strategies:\n      Phone calls can feel intrusive, and emails seem impersonal. Instead, try reaching out to a \u201cweak tie\u201d via text message or Facebook. This will allow the other person to respond whenever they can, so you don\u2019t need to worry about reaching out at the wrong time.\n    Rejection rates when reaching out to a weak tie are extremely low \u2014 in one of Gillian\u2019s studies fewer than 12% of people who talked to strangers experienced a rejection. However, during the pandemic, many people are feeling overwhelmed and some may not respond.\n  If you don\u2019t get a response, don\u2019t take it personally. Remind yourself that the point of reaching out to a weak tie is to let this person know that you are thinking about them. Reframe your expectations: Think about this interaction as smiling at a colleague in the hallway. You\u2019re acknowledging and saying hello to the other person. Perhaps you\u2019ll talk for a few minutes \u2014 but if you don\u2019t that\u2019s fine too.\n  Instead of expecting a reply, enjoy the knowledge that your message is likely to deliver a little hit of happiness, and maybe, like it did for Ashley, could make a real difference in someone\u2019s day.\n    Your goal is to let the other person know you are thinking about them and open up the opportunity to chat,  ifthey want to. It \u2019s okay to keep the conversation short: In recent data one of us collected, a \u201cjust right \u201dconversation with a stranger was about 10 minutes long. If you set the expectation that you only have a few minutes, this lets you both off the hook, and helps you avoid the feeling that socializing is another endless \u201cto-do.  ...\n    Expressing gratitude is a powerful way to improve mood. If you had a colleague who inspired you, or a mentor who gave you excellent career advice, let them know you are thinking of them. Or you could reach out to someone you shared fun times but have lost touch with. You\u2019ll both enjoy the  nostalgic flashback.\n    If you aren\u2019t sure what to write about,  share something personal about yourself \u2014 like a photo of your pet or child doing something cute and/or funny. Sharing aspects of yourself helps to build positive rapport and encourages the other person to reciprocate.\n    Now that our social interactions are often limited to strong ties, and we schedule hour-long calls and board game nights to spend quality time together, we are at risk for becoming burned out. In data that we\u2019ve collected post-Covid-19, we found that the more time that people spent interacting with colleagues and friends online, the more stressed out they felt.\n    As these data suggest, scheduled social interactions are exhausting. Also, they do not work for everyone. People in different time zones, with bad internet connection, who are juggling demanding care-giving and work responsibilities might not have time for formal means of connection that require advanced scheduling, like family or company-mandated happy hours.\n  We can repurpose the informality and spontaneity of weak-tie interactions to help us stay connected while reducing the risk of burnout. Right now, the best social interactions are those that tell others you are thinking of them, without an expectation of a return of time, energy, or attention.\n  If studying weak ties has taught us anything, it is that we need to  practice self-compassion. We might not have the energy for 1.5 hour long social calls every day. That is perfectly alright.\n  The best research shows that even a few minutes of texting is enough to improve your mood and spread joy within your social network \u2014 perhaps more than that never-ending game of Pictionary.\n  We might be missing out on our weak tie interactions right now, but it is in our power to create them. An informal hello with a colleague \u2014 or your mother \u2014 is only a short text message away.\n  Gillian Sandstrom is a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Essex.

after its payment processor\u2019s bank accounts were frozen.\n iFinex Inc., Bitfinex&#39;s parent firm, applied for subpoenas in Colorado, Arizona and Georgia this month, asking federal courts to aid it in deposing banks that may have held funds for Crypto Capital, the payment processor on which Bitfinex stored customers\u2019 and exchange funds.\n An entity hoping to confirm bank records can apply for a subpoena as banks cannot usually share those documents without a court order.\n iFinex applied for a subpoena Tuesday to depose  SunTrust Bank employees in Georgia. This follows a similar subpoena application to depose the  Bank of Colorado earlier in April and  ABT &amp; Trust in Arizona. Bitfinex is looking for evidence to support its legal claims to about $880 million held in bank accounts in Poland, Lisbon, London and elsewhere that have been seized by authorities pursuing anti-money laundering criminal charges against Crypto Capital.\n Bitfinex\u2019s application follows  an initial subpoena request from October 2019, filed in California, where the exchange sought testimony from a former TCA Bancorp executive about Crypto Capital\u2019s accounts. This subpoena  was later granted. A federal judge  likewise granted iFinex&#39;s application in Arizona, while a magistrate judge in Georgia asked the company to  file a corporate disclosure statement first.\n \u201cCrypto Capital used a bank account with Citibank, N.A. (\u2018Citibank\u2019) to accept certain deposits from Applicant\u2019s customers. The account was held in the name of \u2018Global Trading Solutions, LLC,\u2019\u201d the filing in Arizona stated.\n  Bitfinex General Counsel Stuart Hoegner told CoinDesk the filings \u201care aimed squarely at obtaining further information\u201d about the funds held by Crypto Capital.\n \u201cAs we have said before, Bitfinex is the victim of a fraud and is asserting its rights to funds taken by Crypto Capital through legal measures initiated in various countries,\u201d he said through a spokesperson.\n  Bitfinex and its sister firm, stablecoin operator Tether, are the subject of civil lawsuits and an investigation by the  New York Attorney General&#39;s office alleging fraud and market manipulation.\n Tether has denied the allegations in  public statements. It has also aggressively issued more tether (USDT) since the investigation began; about $80 million in new USDT virtual currency  on Thursday alone. This raises the presumed market value of the currency to about $8 billion, an increase of about $2 billion over the last 40 days, according to the Whale Alert tracking service.\n \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at big tether issuances like that, you should look at how other currencies are acting in the market,\u201d said Bennett Tomlin, a bitcoin writer and researcher who has been following the case closely. \u201cThe other stablecoins don\u2019t seem to have the same kind of inflows. And you will very rarely see tether redemptions. It almost always goes up. Because we know from their lawyers that  it\u2019s not fully backed, I\u2019m generally skeptical of larger issuances of tether.\u201d\n Bitfinex began to rely on Crypto Capital as other banking relationships deteriorated, the firm said in the Georgia filing. Banks have grown wary of facilitating trade in cryptocurrency for fear of running afoul of cross-border money laundering laws.\n However, the president of Crypto Capital, Ivan Manuel Molina Lee,  was arrested by Polish authorities in October and charged with being a member of an international gang laundering up to 1.5 billion z\u0142oty or about $390 million \u201cfrom illegal sources.\u201d Authorities wrote that Molina Lee\u2019s crimes included \u201claundering dirty money for Columbian drug cartels using a cryptocurrency exchange.\u201d\n Federal prosecutors indicted a second principal of Crypto Capital, Oz Yosef, in October on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. Oz Yosef\u2019s sister, Ravid, was also indicted on fraud charges connected to Crypto Capital but remains at large in Israel.\n  Crypto Capital managed to stash Bitfinex reserves in banks across the world, according to Bitfinex \u2019s application. \u201cCrypto Capital subsequently transferred funds between and among various banks, including in Europe and the United States. In the U.S. alone, Applicant has information that Crypto Capital used accounts held not only at SunTrust, but also Bank of America, Bank of Colorado, Citibank, Enterprise Bank &amp; Trust, HSBC, Stearns Bank, Wells Fargo, TD Bank, and US Bank, \u201dBitfinex  ...\n  Bitfinex hopes to trace how Crypto Capital moved money from one bank account to another to bolster its ownership claims over funds once held by the processor, according to the filings. Doing so requires navigating the convoluted chain of account ownership, commingled funds and financial transfers Crypto Capital used to manage money, Bitfinex notes in the application.\n Polish banks held about $335 million in Bitfinex fiat currency reserves, while Portuguese banks held about another $218 million, according to the Georgia filing.\n Referring to  statements made by Giancarlo Devasini, Bitfinex \u2019s chief financial officer, the subpoena application said, \u201c[F]rom approximately April to June 2018, Crypto Capital used a bank account ending in -9503 with Citibank to accept deposits from Applicant \u2019s customers. The account was held in the name of Global Trading Solutions, LLC. Because the name of this LLC was similar to that of the entity that then owned Crypto Capital (Global Trade Solutions AG), Applicant believed  ...\n Global Trading Solutions LLC is owned by Reggie Fowler, a former National Football League investor tied to Crypto Capital. Fowler was  indicted one year ago on charges of bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.\n He  rejected a p l ea deal earlier this year; a trial scheduled to begin Tuesday has been pushed to Jan. 11, 2021. A Department of Justice spokesperson said he did not know if the delay is related to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting judicial schedules.\n Citibank in California told Bitfinex\u2019s legal team Fowler opened a separate, personal Citibank banking account at the same time and funded it with a $200,000 deposit from an unknown source and two subsequent wire transfers totaling $4 million. The wire transfers came from Banco BPI, one of three Portuguese banks Crypto Capital used for Bitfinex accounts.\n While Crypto Capital was taking transfers from Bitfinex into one Citibank account, Fowler transferred $380,000 from his account to a SunTrust account, according to the subpoena application.\n  Later, nearly $2 million of iFinex customer funds were transferred from the Citibank account to a Bank of Colorado account, Bitfinex said in the Colorado court filing.\n Citibank told Bitfinex that this Bank of Colorado account \u201cis held in the name of Eligibility Criterion, an entity owned or controlled by Fowler. Moreover, the wire transfer instructions indicated these transfers were \u2018Intercompany Transfers.\u2019\u201d according to the document.\n New York courts have enjoined the firms from further depleting their cash reserves and from transferring any of those cash reserves to company executives, and directed the firms\u2019 executives to produce documents and information central to the attorney general\u2019s investigation. The companies are fighting those disclosures in court, an act that the Attorney General\u2019s office described as \u201c deeply perverse.\u201d\n    The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a  strict set of editorial policies.
